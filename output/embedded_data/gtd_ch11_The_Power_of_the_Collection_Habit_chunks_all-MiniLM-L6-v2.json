Indeed, they offer a system atic method to \nkeep your mind distraction-free, ensuring a high le vel of effi- \nciency and effectiveness in your work. That in itse lf would be suf- \nficient reason to implement these practices. \nBut there are even greater implications for the fun damental \nprinciples at work here. What follows in the next t hree chapters \nis an accounting of my experience, over the last tw enty years, \nof the subtler and often more profound effects that  can tran- \nspire from the implementation of these basic princi ples. The \nlonger-term results can have a significant impact o n you as an \nindividual, and they can positively affect larger o rganizational cul- \ntures as well. \nWhen people with whom you interact notice that with out \nfail you receive, process, and organize in an airti ght manner the \nexchanges and agreements they have with you, they b egin to trust \nyou in a unique way. Such is the power of capturing  placeholders \nfor anything that is incomplete or unprocessed in y our life. It \nnoticeably enhances your mental well-being and impr oves the \nquality of your communications and relationships, b oth person- \nally and professionally. \n225 \n226 THE POWER OF THE KEY PRINCIPLES  I  PART THREE \nThe Personal Benefit \nHow did it feel to go through the collecting and do wnloading \nactivity? Most people say it feels so bad, and yet feels so good. \nHow can that be? \nIf you're like most people who go through the full collec- \ntion process, you probably felt some form of anxiet y. Descriptive \nterms like \"overwhelmed,\" \"panic,\" \"frustration,\" \" fatigue,\" and \n\"disgust\" tend to come up when I ask seminar partic ipants to \ndescribe their emotions in going through a minor ve rsion of this \nprocedure. And is there anything you think you've p rocrastinated \non in that stack? If so, you have guilt automatical ly associated \nwith it—\"I could have, should have, ought to have ( before now) \ndone this.\" \nAt the same time, did you experience any sense of r elease, or \nrelief, or control as you were did the drill? Most people say yes, \nindeed. How does that happen? Totally opposite emot ional states \nshowing up as you're doing a single exercise, almos t at the same \ntime—anxiety and relief; overwhelmed and in control . What's \ngoing on here? \nWhen you understand the source of your negative fee lings \nabout all your stuff, you'll discover, as I did, th e way to get rid of \nthem. And if you experienced any positive feelings from collect- \ning your stuff, you actually began the process of e liminating the \nnegativity yourself. \nThe Source of the Negative Feelings \nWhere do the not-so-good feelings come from? Too mu ch to do? \nNo, there's always too much to do. If you felt bad simply because \nthere was more to do than you could do, you'd never  get rid of that \nfeeling. Having too much to do is not the source of  the negative \nfeeling. It comes from a different place. \nHow have you felt when someone broke an agreement w ith \nCHAPTER 11   I  THE POWER OF THE COLLECTION HABIT \nyou? Told you they would meet you Thursday at 4:00 P.M. and never \nshowed or called? How did that feel? Frustrating, I  imagine. The \nprice people pay when they break agreements in the world is the dis- \nintegration of trust in the relationship—a negative\nconsequence. \nBut what are all those things in your in-basket? \nAgreements you've made with yourself. Your negative\nfeelings are simply the result of breaking those ag ree- \nments—they're the symptoms of disintegrated self- \ntrust. If you tell yourself to draft a strategic plan, whe n \nyou don't do it, you'll feel bad. Tell yourself to get orga- \nnized, and if you fail to, welcome to guilt and fru stra- \ntion. Resolve to spend more time with your kids and\ndon't—voila! anxious and overwhelmed. \nHow Do You Prevent Broken Agreements with Yourself? \nIf the negative feelings come from broken agreement s, you have \nthree options for dealing with them and eliminating  the negative \nconsequences: \n• Don't make the agreement. \n• Complete the agreement. \n• Renegotiate the agreement. \nAll of these",

Indeed, they offer a system atic method to \nkeep your mind distraction-free, ensuring a high le vel of effi- \nciency and effectiveness in your work. That in itse lf would be suf- \nficient reason to implement these practices. \nBut there are even greater implications for the fun damental \nprinciples at work here. What follows in the next t hree chapters \nis an accounting of my experience, over the last tw enty years, \nof the subtler and often more profound effects that  can tran- \nspire from the implementation of these basic princi ples. The \nlonger-term results can have a significant impact o n you as an \nindividual, and they can positively affect larger o rganizational cul- \ntures as well. \nWhen people with whom you interact notice that with out \nfail you receive, process, and organize in an airti ght manner the \nexchanges and agreements they have with you, they b egin to trust \nyou in a unique way.

Descriptive \nterms like \"overwhelmed,\" \"panic,\" \"frustration,\" \" fatigue,\" and \n\"disgust\" tend to come up when I ask seminar partic ipants to \ndescribe their emotions in going through a minor ve rsion of this \nprocedure. And is there anything you think you've p rocrastinated \non in that stack?

What follows in the next t hree chapters \nis an accounting of my experience, over the last tw enty years, \nof the subtler and often more profound effects that  can tran- \nspire from the implementation of these basic princi ples. The \nlonger-term results can have a significant impact o n you as an \nindividual, and they can positively affect larger o rganizational cul- \ntures as well. \nWhen people with whom you interact notice that with out \nfail you receive, process, and organize in an airti ght manner the \nexchanges and agreements they have with you, they b egin to trust \nyou in a unique way. Such is the power of capturing  placeholders \nfor anything",

Most people say yes, \nindeed. How does that happen?

Having too much to do is not the source of  the negative \nfeeling.

The \nprice people pay when they break agreements in the world is the dis- \nintegration of trust in the relationship—a negative\nconsequence. \nBut what are all those things in your in-basket? \nAgreements you've made with yourself. Your negative\nfeelings are simply the result of breaking those ag ree- \nments—they're the symptoms of disintegrated self- \ntrust. If you tell yourself to draft a strategic plan, whe n \nyou don't do it, you'll feel bad. Tell yourself to get orga- \nnized, and if you fail to, welcome to guilt and fru stra- \ntion.

One way to handle an incompletio n in your \nworld is to just say no! \nYou'd lighten up if you would just lower your stand ards. \nIf you didn't care so much about things being up to  a certain \n227 The sense of\nanxiety and guilt\ndoesn't come from \nhaving too much to \ndo; it's the \nautomatic result of\nbreaking \nagreements with \nyourself.\nTHE POWER OF THE KEY PRINCIPLES I PART THREE \nlevel—your parenting, your school system, your team 's morale, the \nsoftware code—you'd have fewer things to do.* \nI doubt you're going to lower your standards. But o nce you \nreally understand what it means, you'll probably ma ke fewer \nagreements. I know I did. I used to make a lot of t hem, just to win \npeople's approval. When I realized the price I was paying on the \nback end for not keeping those agreements, I became  a lot more \nconscious about the ones I made. One insurance exec utive I \nworked with described the major benefit he derived from imple- \nmenting this system: \"Previously I would just tell everyone, 'Sure, \nI'll do it,' because I didn't know how much I reall y had to do. Now \nthat I've got the inventory clear and complete, jus t to maintain my \nintegrity I have had to say, 'No, I can't do that, I'm sorry.' The \namazing thing is that instead of being upset with m y \nrefusal, everyone was impressed by my discipline!\" \nAnother client, an entrepreneur in the personal \ncoaching business, recently told me that making an \ninventory of his work had eliminated a huge amount \nof worry and stress from his life. The discipline o f \nputting everything he had his attention on into his\nin-basket caused him to reconsider what he really \nwanted to do anything about. If he wasn't willing to toss a note \nabout it into \"in,\" he just let it go! \nI consider that very mature thinking. One of the be st things \nabout this whole method is that when you really tak e the respon- \nsibility to capture and track what's on your mind, you'll think \ntwice about making commitments internally that you don't really \nneed or want to make. Not being aware of all you ha ve to do is \n228 *It has been a popular concept in the self-help wor ld that focusing on your val- \nues will simplify your life. I contend the opposite : the overwhelming amount of \nthings that people have to do comes from their values. Values are critical ele- \nments for meaning and direction. But don't kid your self—the more you focus \non them, the more things you're likely to feel resp onsible for taking on. Your \nvalues may make it easier for you to make decisions , but don't think they'll \nmake things any simpler. Maintaining an \nobjective inventory \nof your work makes \nit much easier to \nsay no with \nintegrity. \nCHAPTER 11  I THE POWER OF THE COLLECTION HABIT \nmuch like having a credit card for which you don't know the bal- \nance or the limit—it's a lot easier to be irrespons ible. \nComplete the Agreement \nOf course, another way to get rid of the negative f eelings about \nyour stuff is to just finish it and be able to mark  it off as done. You \nactually love to do things, as long as you get the feel- \ning that you've completed something. If you've begu n \nto complete less-than-two-minute actions as they \nsurface in your life, I'm sure you can attest to th e psy- \nchological benefit. Most of my clients feel fantast ic \nafter just a couple of hours of processing their pi les, \njust because of how many things they accomplish \nusing the two-minute rule. \nOne of your better weekends may be spent just finis hing up a \nlot of little errands and tasks that have accumulat ed around your \nhouse and in your personal life.

The discipline o f \nputting everything he had his attention on into his\nin-basket caused him to reconsider what he really \nwanted to do anything about. If he wasn't willing to toss a note \nabout it into \"in,\" he just let it go! \nI consider that very mature thinking. One of the be st things \nabout this whole method is that when you really tak e the respon- \nsibility to capture and track what's on your mind, you'll think \ntwice about making commitments internally that you don't really \nneed or want to make.

If you've begu n \nto complete less-than-two-minute actions as they \nsurface in your life, I'm sure you can attest to th e psy- \nchological benefit. Most of my clients feel fantast ic \nafter just a couple of hours of processing their pi les, \njust because of how many things they accomplish \nusing the two-minute rule. \nOne of your better weekends may be spent just finis hing up a \nlot of little errands and tasks that have accumulat ed around your \nhouse and",

The discipline o f \nputting everything he had his attention on into his\nin-basket caused him to reconsider what he really \nwanted to do anything about. If he wasn't willing to toss a note \nabout it into \"in,\" he just let it go! \nI consider that very mature thinking. One of the be st things \nabout this whole method is that when you really tak e the respon- \nsibility to capture and track what's on your mind, you'll think \ntwice about making commitments internally that you don't really \nneed or want to make. Not being aware of all you ha ve to do is \n228 *It has been a popular concept in the self-help wor ld that focusing on your val- \nues will simplify your life. I contend the opposite : the overwhelming amount of \nthings that people have to do comes from their values. Values are critical ele- \nments for meaning and direction. But don't kid your self—the more you focus \non them, the more things you're likely to feel resp onsible for taking on. Your \nvalues may make it easier for you to make decisions ,",

Invariably when yo u capture all \nthe open loops, little and big, and see them on a l ist in front of \nyou, some part of you will be inspired (or creative ly disgusted or \nintimidated enough) to go knock them off the list. \nWe all seem to be starved for a win. It's great to satisfy \nthat by giving yourself doable tasks you can start and finish \neasily. \nHave you ever completed something that wasn't initi ally on a \nlist, so you wrote it down and checked it off? Then  you know \nwhat I mean. \nThere's another issue here, however. How \nwould you feel if your list and your stack were \ntotally—and successfully—completed? You'd proba- \nbly be bouncing off the ceiling, full of creative e nergy. \nOf course, within three days, guess what you'd have ? \nRight—another list, and probably an even bigger \none! You'd feel so good about finishing all your st uff you'd likely \ntake on bigger, more ambitious things to do. \nNot only that, but if you have a boss, what do you think he or \n229 Out of the strain of \nthe doing, into the \npeace of the done. \n—-Julia Louis \nWoodruff \nIt's a lot easier \nto complete \nagreements when \nyou know what \nthey are. \nTHE POWER OF THE KEY PRINCIPLES  I  PART THREE \nshe is going to do, after noticing the high levels of competency \nand productivity you're demonstrating? Right again— give you \nmore things to do! It's the catch-22 of professiona l development: \nthe better you get, the better you'd better get. \nSo, since you're not going to significantly lower y our stan- \ndards, or stop creating more things to do, you'd be tter get com- \nfortable with the third option, if you want to keep  from stressing \nyourself out. \nRenegotiate Your Agreement \nSuppose I'd told you I would meet you Thursday at 4 :00 P.M., \nbut after I made the appointment, my world changed.  Now, given \nmy new priorities, I decide I'm not going to meet you Thursday \nat four. But instead of simply not showing up, what  had I better \ndo, to maintain the integrity of the relationship? Correct—call \nand change the agreement. A renegotiated agreement is not a \nbroken one. \nDo you understand yet why getting all your \nstuff out of your head and in front of you makes yo u \nfeel better? Because you automatically renegotiate \nyour agreements with yourself when you look at \nthem, think about them, and either act on them that\nvery moment or say, \"No, not now.\" Here's the prob-\nlem: it's impossible to renegotiate agreements with\nyourself that you can't remember you made! \nThe fact that you can't remember an agreement \nyou made with yourself doesn't mean that you're not\nholding yourself liable for it. Ask any psychologis t \nhow much of a sense of past and future that part of  your psyche \nhas, the part that was storing the list you dumped:  zero. It's all \npresent tense in there. That means that as soon as you tell yourself \nthat you should do something, if you file it only i n your short- \nterm memory, there's a part of you that thinks you should be \ndoing it all the time. And that means that as soon as you've given \nyourself two things to do, and filed them only in y our head, \n230 It  is the act of \nforgiveness that \nopens up the only \npossible way to \nthink creatively \nabout the future at \nall. \n—\nFather \nCHAPTER 11   I  THE POWER OF THE COLLECTION HABIT \nyou've created instant and automatic stress and fai lure, because \nyou can't do them both at the same time. \nIf you're like most people, you've probably got som e storage \narea at home—maybe a garage that you told yourself a while back \n(maybe even six years ago!) you ought to clean and organize. If so, \nthere's a part of you that likely thinks you should 've been cleaning \nyour garage twenty-four hours a day for the past si x years! No \nwonder people are so tired! And have you heard that  little voice \ninside your own mental committee every time you wal k by your \ngarage? \"Why are we walking by the garage?! Aren't we supposed \nto be cleaning it!?\" Because you can't stand that w hining, nagging \npart of yourself, you never even go in the garage a nymore if you \ncan help it. If",

But instead of simply not showing up, what  had I better \ndo, to maintain the integrity of the relationship? Correct—call \nand change the agreement. A renegotiated agreement is not a \nbroken one. \nDo you understand yet why getting all your \nstuff out of your head and in front of you makes yo u \nfeel better? Because you automatically renegotiate \nyour agreements with yourself when you look at \nthem, think about them, and either act on them that\nvery moment or say, \"No, not now.\" Here's the prob-\nlem: it's impossible to renegotiate agreements with\nyourself that you can't remember you made! \nThe fact that you can't remember an agreement \nyou made with yourself doesn't mean that you're not\nholding yourself liable for it. Ask any psychologis t \nhow much of a sense of past and future that part of  your psyche \nhas, the part that was storing the list you dumped:  zero. It's all \npresent tense in there. That means that as soon as you tell yourself \nthat you should do something, if you file it only i n your short- \nterm memory, there's a part of you that thinks you should be \ndoing it all the time. And that means that as soon as you've given \nyourself two things to do, and filed them only in y our head, \n230 It  is the act of \nforgiveness that \nopens up the only \npossible way to \nthink creatively \nabout the future at \nall. \n—\nFather \nCHAPTER 11   I  THE POWER OF THE COLLECTION HABIT \nyou've created instant and automatic stress and fai lure, because \nyou can't do them both at the same time. \nIf you're like most people, you've probably got som e storage \narea at home—maybe a garage that you told yourself a while back \n(maybe even six years ago!) you ought to clean and organize. If so, \nthere's a part of you that likely thinks you should 've been cleaning \nyour garage twenty-four hours a day for the past si x years! No \nwonder people are so tired! And have you heard that  little voice \ninside your own mental committee every time you wal k by your \ngarage? \"Why are we walking by",

But instead of simply not showing up, what  had I better \ndo, to maintain the integrity of the relationship? Correct—call \nand change the agreement. A renegotiated agreement is not a \nbroken one. \nDo you understand yet why getting all your \nstuff out of your head and in front of you makes yo u \nfeel better? Because you automatically renegotiate \nyour agreements with yourself when you look at \nthem, think about them, and either act on them that\nvery moment or say, \"No, not now.\" Here's the prob-\nlem: it's impossible to renegotiate agreements with\nyourself that you can't remember you made! \nThe fact that you can't remember an agreement \nyou made with yourself doesn't mean that you're not\nholding yourself liable for it. Ask any psychologis t \nhow much of a sense of past and future that part of  your psyche \nhas, the part that was storing the list you dumped:  zero. It's all \npresent tense in there. That means that as soon as you tell yourself \nthat you should do something",

    "text": " the garage?! Aren't we supposed \nto be cleaning it!?\" Because you can't stand that w hining, nagging \npart of yourself, you never even go in the garage a nymore if you \ncan help it. If you want to shut that voice up, you  have three \noptions for dealing with your agreement with yourse lf: \n1 |   Lower your standards about your garage (you ma y have done \nthat already). \"So I have a crappy garage . .. who cares?\" \n2 |   Keep the agreement—clean the garage. \n3 |   At least put \"Clean garage\" on a \"Someday/Maybe \" list. \nThen, when you review that list weekly and you see that \nitem, you can tell yourself, \"Not this week.\" The n ext time \nyou walk by your garage, you won't hear a thing int ernally, \nother than \"Ha! Not this week.\" \nI'm quite sincere about this. It seems that there's  a part of our \npsyche that doesn't know the difference between an agreement \nabout cleaning the garage and an agreement about bu ying a com- \npany. In there, they're both just agreements—kept o r broken. If \nyou're holding something only internally, it will b e a broken \nagreement if you're not moving on it in the moment.\nThe Radical Departure from Traditional Time Managem ent \nThis method is significantly different from traditi onal time- \nmanagement training. Most of those models leave you  with the \nimpression that if something you tell yourself to d o isn't that \n231 \n232 THE POWER OF THE KEY PRINCIPLES  |  PART THREE \nimportant, then it's not that important—to track, m anage, or deal \nwith. But in my experience that's inaccurate, at le ast in terms of \nhow a less-than-conscious part of us operates. It is how our con- \nscious mind operates, however, so every agreement m ust be made \nconscious. That means it must be captured, objectif ied, and \nreviewed regularly in full conscious awareness so t hat you can put \nit where it belongs in your self-management arena. If that doesn't \nhappen, it will actually take up a lot more psychic  energy than it \ndeserves. \nIn my experience, anything that is held only in \"ps ychic \nRAM\" will take up either more or less attention tha n it deserves. \nThe reason to collect everything is not that everyt hing is equally \nimportant, it's that it's not. Incompletions, uncollected, take on a \ndull sameness in the sense of the pressure they cre ate and the \nattention they tie up. \nHow Much Collection Is Required? \nYou'll feel better collecting anything that you haven't collected yet. \nWhen you say to yourself, \"Oh, that's right, I need  to get butter \nnext time I'm at the store,\" and you write it on yo ur grocery list, \nyou'll feel better. When you remember, \"I've got to  call my banker \nabout the trust fund,\" and you write that down some place where \nyou know you'll see it when you're at a phone, you' ll feel better. \nBut there will be a light-year's difference when yo u know you \nhave it all. \nWhen will you know how much you have left in your h ead to \ncollect? Only when there's nothing left. If some pa rt of you is even \nvaguely aware that you don't have it all, you can't  really know what \npercentage you have collected. How will you know wh en there's \nnothing left? When nothing else shows up as a remin der in your \nmind. \nThis doesn't mean that your mind will be empty. If you're \nconscious, your mind will always be focusing on som ething. But if \nit's focusing on only one thing at a time, without distraction, \nyou'll be in your \"zone.\" \nCHAPTER 11   I  THE POWER OF THE COLLECTION HABIT \nI suggest that you use your mind to think about things, rather \nthan think of them. You want to be adding value as you think \nabout projects and people, not simply reminding you rself they \nexist. To fully realize that more productive place,  you will need to \ncapture it all. It takes focus and a change of habi t to train yourself \nto recognize and download even the smallest agreeme nts with \nyourself as they're created in your mind. Doing the  collection \nprocess as fully as you can, and then incorporating  the behavior of \ncapturing all the new things as they emerge, will b e empowering \nand productive. \nWhen Relationships and Organizations \nHave the Collection Habit \nWhat happens when everyone involved on",

    "text": " the garage?! Aren't we supposed \nto be cleaning it!?\" Because you can't stand that w hining, nagging \npart of yourself, you never even go in the garage a nymore if you \ncan help it. If you want to shut that voice up, you  have three \noptions for dealing with your agreement with yourse lf: \n1 |   Lower your standards about your garage (you ma y have done \nthat already). \"So I have a crappy garage . .. who cares?\" \n2 |   Keep the agreement—clean the garage. \n3 |   At least put \"Clean garage\" on a \"Someday/Maybe \" list. \nThen, when you review that list weekly and you see that \nitem, you can tell yourself, \"Not this week.\" The n ext time \nyou walk by your garage, you won't hear a thing int ernally, \nother than \"Ha! Not this week.\" \nI'm quite sincere about this. It seems that there's  a part of our \npsyche that doesn't know the difference between an agreement \nabout cleaning the garage and an agreement about bu ying a com- \npany. In there, they're both just agreements—kept o r broken. If \nyou're holding something only internally, it will b e a broken \nagreement if you're not moving on it in the moment.\nThe Radical Departure from Traditional Time Managem ent \nThis method is significantly different from traditi onal time- \nmanagement training. Most of those models leave you  with the \nimpression that if something you tell yourself to d o isn't that \n231 \n232 THE POWER OF THE KEY PRINCIPLES  |  PART THREE \nimportant, then it's not that important—to track, m anage, or deal \nwith. But in my experience that's inaccurate, at le ast in terms of \nhow a less-than-conscious part of us operates. It is how our con- \nscious mind operates, however, so every agreement m ust be made \nconscious. That means it must be captured, objectif ied, and \nreviewed regularly in full conscious awareness so t hat you can put \nit where it belongs in your self-management arena. If that doesn't \nhappen, it will actually take up a lot more psychic  energy than it \ndeserves. \nIn my experience, anything that is held only in \"ps ychic \nRAM\" will take up either",

If that doesn't \nhappen, it will actually take up a lot more psychic  energy than it \ndeserves. \nIn my experience, anything that is held only in \"ps ychic \nRAM\" will take up either more or less attention tha n it deserves. \nThe reason to collect everything is not that everyt hing is equally \nimportant, it's that it's not. Incompletions, uncollected, take on a \ndull sameness in the sense of the pressure they cre ate and the \nattention they tie up. \nHow Much Collection Is Required? \nYou'll feel better collecting anything that you haven't collected yet. \nWhen you say to yourself, \"Oh, that's right, I need  to get butter \nnext time I'm at the store,\" and you write it on yo ur grocery list, \nyou'll feel better. When you remember, \"I've got to  call my banker \nabout the trust fund,\" and you write that down some place where \nyou know you'll see it when you're at a phone, you' ll feel better. \nBut there will be a light-year's difference when yo u know you \nhave it all. \nWhen will you know how much you have left in your h ead to \ncollect? Only when there's nothing left. If some pa rt of you is even \nvaguely aware that you don't have it all, you can't  really know what \npercentage you have collected. How will you know wh en there's \nnothing left? When nothing else shows up as a remin der in your \nmind. \nThis doesn't mean that your mind will be empty. If you're \nconscious, your mind will always be focusing on som ething. But if \nit's focusing on only one thing at a time, without distraction, \nyou'll be in your \"zone.\" \nCHAPTER 11   I  THE POWER OF THE COLLECTION HABIT \nI suggest that you use your mind to think about things, rather \nthan think of them. You want to be adding value as you think \nabout projects and people, not simply reminding you rself they \nexist. To fully realize that more productive place,  you will need to \ncapture it all. It takes focus and a change of habi t to train yourself \nto recognize and download even the smallest agreeme nts with \nyourself as they're created in your mind. Doing the  collection \n",

If that doesn't \nhappen, it will actually take up a lot more psychic  energy than it \ndeserves. \nIn my experience, anything that is held only in \"ps ychic \nRAM\" will take up either more or less attention tha n it deserves. \nThe reason to collect everything is not that everyt hing is equally \nimportant, it's that it's not. Incompletions, uncollected, take on a \ndull sameness in the sense of the pressure they cre ate and the \nattention they tie up. \nHow Much Collection Is Required? \nYou'll feel better collecting anything that you haven't collected yet. \nWhen you say to yourself, \"Oh, that's right, I need  to get butter \nnext time I'm at the store,\" and you write it on yo ur grocery list, \nyou'll feel better. When you remember, \"I've got to  call my banker \nabout the trust fund,\" and you write that down some place where \nyou know you'll see it when you're at a phone, you' ll feel better. \nBut there will be a light-year's difference when yo u know you \nhave it all. \nWhen will you know",

Frankly, \nonce you've achieved that, you'll hardly think abou t whether peo- \nple are dropping the ball anymore-—there will be mu ch bigger \nthings to occupy your attention. \nBut if communication gaps are still an issue, there 's likely \nsome layer of frustration and a general nervousness  in the culture. \nMost people feel that without constant baby-sitting  and hand- \nholding, things could disappear in the system and t hen blow up at \nany time. They don't realize that they're feeling t his because \nthey've been in this situation so consistently that  they relate to \nit as if it were a permanent law, like gravity. It doesn't have to be \nthat way. \nI have noticed this for years. Good people who have n't incor- \nporated these behaviors come into my environment, a nd they \nstick out like a sore thumb. I've lived with the st andards of clear \npsychic RAM and hard, clean edges on in-baskets for  more than \ntwo decades now. When a note sits idle in someone's  in-basket \nunprocessed, or when he or she nods \"yes, I will\" i n a conversation \n233 \nTHE POWER OF THE KEY PRINCIPLES  I  PART THREE \nbut doesn't write anything down, my \"uh-oh\" bell ri ngs. This is \nunacceptable behavior in my world. There are much b igger fish to \nfry than worrying about leaks in the system. \nI need to trust that any request or relevant infor-\nmation I put on a voice-mail, in an e-mail, in a co n- \nversation, or in a written note will get into the o ther \nperson's system and that it will be processed and \norganized, soon, and available for his or her revie w as \nan option for action. If the recipient is managing \nvoice-mails but not e-mail and paper, I have now be en hamstrung \nto use only his or her trusted medium. That should be unaccept- \nable behavior in any organization that cares about whether things \nhappen with the least amount of effort. \nWhen change is required, there must be trust that t he initia- \ntives for that change will be dealt with appropriat ely. Any intact \nsystem will ultimately be only as good as its weake st link, and \noften that Achilles' heel is a key person's dulled responsiveness to \ncommunications in the system. \nI especially notice this when I walk around organiz ations \nwhere in-baskets are either nonexistent, or overflo wing and obvi- \nously long unprocessed. These cultures usually suff er from serious \n\"interruptitis\" because they can't trust putting co mmunications \ninto the system. \nWhere cultures do have solid systems, down through the \nlevel of paper, the clarity is palpable. It's hardl y even a conscious \nconcern, and everyone's attention is more focused. The same is \ntrue in families that have instituted in-baskets—fo r the parents, \nthe children, the nanny, the housekeeper, or anyone  else with \nwhom family members frequently interact. People oft en grimace \nwhen I tell them that my wife, Kathryn, and I put t hings in each \nother's in-baskets, even when we're sitting within a few feet of \neach other; to them it seems \"cold and mechanical.\"  Aside from \nbeing an act of politeness intended to avoid interr upting the \nother's work in progress, the practice actually fos ters more warmth \nand freedom between us, because mechanical things a re being \n234 Bailing water in a \nleaky boat diverts \nenergy from rowing \nthe boat. \nCHAPTER 11 | THE POWER OF THE COLLECTION HABIT \nhandled in the system instead of tying up our atten tion in the \nrelationship. \nUnfortunately, you can't legislate personal systems . Everyone \nmust have his or her own way to deal with what he o r \nshe has to deal with. You can, however, hold people\naccountable for outcomes, and for tracking and man-\naging everything that comes their way. And you can \ngive them the information in this book. Then, at \nleast, they'll have no excuse for letting something  fall \nthrough the cracks. \nThis doesn't mean that everyone has to do \neverything. I hope I",

Frankly, \nonce you've achieved that, you'll hardly think abou t whether peo- \nple are dropping the ball anymore-—there will be mu ch bigger \nthings to occupy your attention. \nBut if communication gaps are still an issue, there 's likely \nsome layer of frustration and a general nervousness  in the culture. \nMost people feel that without constant baby-sitting  and hand- \nholding, things could disappear in the system and t hen blow up at \nany time.

    "text": ". And you can \ngive them the information in this book. Then, at \nleast, they'll have no excuse for letting something  fall \nthrough the cracks. \nThis doesn't mean that everyone has to do \neverything. I hope I have described a way to relate  to \nour relatively new knowledge-based world that gives\nroom for everyone to have a lot more to do than he or \nshe can do. The critical issue will be to facilitate a \nconstant renegotiation process with all involved, s o \nthey feel OK about what they're not doing. That's \nreal knowledge work, at a more sophisticated level.  But there's lit- \ntle hope of getting there without having bulletproo f collection \nsystems in play. Remember, you can't renegotiate an  agreement \nwith yourself that you can't remember you made. And  you cer- \ntainly can't renegotiate agreements with others tha t you've lost \ntrack of. \nWhen groups of people collectively adopt the 100 pe rcent \ncollection standard, they have a tight ship to sail . It doesn't mean \nthey're sailing in the right direction, or even tha t they're on the \nright ship; it just means that the one they're on, in the direction \nit's going, is doing that with the most efficient e nergy it can. \n235 Organizations must\ncreate a culture in \nwhich it is \nacceptable that\neveryone has more \nto do than he or she \ncan do, and in \nwhich it is sage to \nrenegotiate \nagreements about\nwhat everyone is \nnot doing.",

    "text": ". And you can \ngive them the information in this book. Then, at \nleast, they'll have no excuse for letting something  fall \nthrough the cracks. \nThis doesn't mean that everyone has to do \neverything. I hope I have described a way to relate  to \nour relatively new knowledge-based world that gives\nroom for everyone to have a lot more to do than he or \nshe can do. The critical issue will be to facilitate a \nconstant renegotiation process with all involved, s o \nthey feel OK about what they're not doing. That's \nreal knowledge work, at a more sophisticated level.  But there's lit- \ntle hope of getting there without having bulletproo f collection \nsystems in play. Remember, you can't renegotiate an  agreement \nwith yourself that you can't remember you made. And  you cer- \ntainly can't renegotiate agreements with others tha t you've lost \ntrack of. \nWhen groups of people collectively adopt the 100 pe rcent \ncollection standard, they have a tight ship to sail . It doesn't mean \nthey're sailing in the right direction, or even tha t they're on the \nright ship; it just means that the one they're on, in the direction \nit's going, is doing that with the most efficient e nergy it can. \n235 Organizations must\ncreate a culture in \nwhich it is \nacceptable that\neveryone has more \nto do than he or she \ncan do, and in \nwhich it is sage to \nrenegotiate \nagreements about\nwhat everyone is \nnot doing.",

Then, at \nleast, they'll have no excuse for letting something  fall \nthrough the cracks. \nThis doesn't mean that everyone has to do \neverything. I hope I have described a way to relate  to \nour relatively new knowledge-based world that gives\nroom for everyone to have a lot more to do than he or \nshe can do. The critical issue will be to facilitate a \nconstant renegotiation process with all involved, s o \nthey feel OK about what they're not doing. That's \nreal knowledge work, at a more sophisticated level.  But there's lit- \ntle hope of getting there without having bulletproo f collection \nsystems in play. Remember, you can't renegotiate an  agreement \nwith yourself that you can't remember you made. And  you cer- \ntainly can't renegotiate agreements with others tha t you've lost \ntrack of. \nWhen groups of people collectively adopt the 100 pe rcent \ncollection standard, they have a tight ship to sail . It doesn't mean \nthey're sailing in the right direction, or even tha t they're on the \nright ship; it just means that the one they're",
