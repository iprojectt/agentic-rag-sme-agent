T welve months earlier , the French\nauthor had promised his publisher a new book. But instead\nof writing, he spent that year pursuing other projects,\nentertaining guests, and delaying his work. Frustrated,\nHugo’s publisher responded by setting a deadline less than\nsix months away . The book had to be ﬁnished by F ebruary\n1831.\nHugo concocted a strange plan to beat his\nprocrastination. He collected all of his clothes and asked an\nassistant to lock them away in a large chest. He was left\nwith nothing to wear except a large shawl. Lacking any\nsuitable clothing to go outdoors, he remained in his study\nand wrote furiously during the fall and winter of 1830. The\nHunchback of Notre Dame  was published two weeks early\non January 14, 1831. *\nSometimes success is less about making good habits\neasy and more about making bad habits hard. This is an\ninversion of the 3rd Law of Behavior Change: make it\ndiﬀicult . If you ﬁnd yourself continually struggling to follow\nthrough on your plans, then you can take a page from\nVictor Hugo and make your bad habits more diﬀicult by\ncreating what psychologists call a commitment device .\nA commitment device is a choice you make in the present\nthat controls your actions in the future. It is a way to lock\nin future behavior , bind you to good habits, and restrict you\nfrom bad ones. When V ictor Hugo shut his clothes away so\nhe could focus on writing, he was creating a commitment\ndevice. *\nThere are many ways to create a commitment device.\nYou can reduce overeating by purchasing food in individual\npackages rather than in bulk size. Y ou can voluntarily ask\nto be added to the banned list at casinos and online poker\nsites to prevent future gambling sprees. I’ve even heard of\nathletes who have to “make weight” for a competition\nchoosing to leave their wallets at home during the week\nbefore weigh-in so they won’t be tempted to buy fast food.\nAs another example, my friend and fellow habits expert\nNir Eyal purchased an outlet timer , which is an adapter\nthat he plugged in between his internet router and the\npower outlet. A t 10 p.m. each night, the outlet timer cuts\noﬀ the power to the router . When the internet goes oﬀ ,\neveryone knows it is time to go to bed.\nCommitment devices are useful because they enable you\nto take advantage of good intentions before you can fall\nvictim to temptation. Whenever I’m looking to cut calories,\nfor example, I will ask the waiter to split my meal and box\nhalf of it to go before  the meal is served. If I waited until\nthe meal came out and told myself “I’ll just eat half ,” it\nwould never work.\nThe key is to change the task such that it requires more\nwork to get out of the good habit than to get started on it.\nIf you’re feeling motivated to get in shape, schedule a yoga\nsession and pay ahead of time. If you’re excited about the\nbusiness you want to start, email an entrepreneur you\nrespect and set up a consulting call. When the time comes\nto act, the only way to bail is to cancel the meeting, which\nrequires eﬀort and may cost money .\nCommitment devices increase the odds that you’ll do the\nright thing in the future by making bad habits diﬀicult in\nthe present. However , we can do even better . We can make\ngood habits inevitable and bad habits impossible.\nHOW TO A UTOMA TE A HABIT AND NEVER THINK\nABOUT IT AGAIN\nJohn Henry P atterson was born in Dayton, Ohio, in 1844.\nHe spent his childhood doing chores on the family farm and\nworking shifts at his father’s sawmill. A fter attending\ncollege at Dartmouth, P atterson returned to Ohio and\nopened a small supply store for coal miners.\nIt seemed like a good opportunity . The store faced little\ncompetition and enjoyed a steady stream of customers, but\nstill struggled to make money . That was when P atterson\ndiscovered his employees were stealing from him.\nIn the mid-1800s, employee theft was a common\nproblem. Receipts were kept in an open drawer and could\neasily be altered or discarded. There were no video\ncameras to review behavior and no software to track\ntransactions. Unless you were willing to hover over your\nemployees every minute of the day , or to manage all\ntransactions yourself , it was di",

T welve months earlier , the French\nauthor had promised his publisher a new book. But instead\nof writing, he spent that year pursuing other projects,\nentertaining guests, and delaying his work. Frustrated,\nHugo’s publisher responded by setting a deadline less than\nsix months away . The book had to be ﬁnished by F ebruary\n1831.\nHugo concocted a strange plan to beat his\nprocrastination.

When V ictor Hugo shut his clothes away so\nhe could focus on writing, he was creating a commitment\ndevice. *\nThere are many ways to create a commitment device.\nYou can reduce overeating by purchasing food in individual\npackages rather than in bulk size. Y ou can voluntarily ask\nto be added to the banned list at casinos and online poker\nsites to prevent future gambling sprees. I’ve even heard of\nathletes who have to “make weight” for a competition\nchoosing to leave their wallets at home during the week\nbefore weigh-in so they won’t be tempted to buy fast food.\nAs another example, my friend and fellow habits expert\nNir Eyal purchased an outlet timer , which is an",

T welve months earlier , the French\nauthor had promised his publisher a new book. But instead\nof writing, he spent that year pursuing other projects,\nentertaining guests, and delaying his work. Frustrated,\nHugo’s publisher responded by setting a deadline less than\nsix months away . The book had to be ﬁnished by F ebruary\n1831.\nHugo concocted a strange plan to beat his\nprocrastination. He collected all of his clothes and asked an\nassistant to lock them away in a large chest. He was left\nwith nothing to wear except a large shawl. Lacking any\nsuitable clothing to go outdoors, he remained in his study\nand wrote furiously during the fall and winter of 1830. The\nHunchback of Notre Dame  was published two weeks early\non January 14, 1831. *\nSometimes success is less about making good habits\neasy and more about making bad habits hard. This is an\ninversion of the 3rd Law",

    "text": " of Notre Dame  was published two weeks early\non January 14, 1831. *\nSometimes success is less about making good habits\neasy and more about making bad habits hard. This is an\ninversion of the 3rd Law of Behavior Change: make it\ndiﬀicult . If you ﬁnd yourself continually struggling to follow\nthrough on your plans, then you can take a page from\nVictor Hugo and make your bad habits more diﬀicult by\ncreating what psychologists call a commitment device .\nA commitment device is a choice you make in the present\nthat controls your actions in the future. It is a way to lock\nin future behavior , bind you to good habits, and restrict you\nfrom bad ones. When V ictor Hugo shut his clothes away so\nhe could focus on writing, he was creating a commitment\ndevice. *\nThere are many ways to create a commitment device.\nYou can reduce overeating by purchasing food in individual\npackages rather than in bulk size. Y ou can voluntarily ask\nto be added to the banned list at casinos and online poker\nsites to prevent future gambling sprees. I’ve even heard of\nathletes who have to “make weight” for a competition",

A t 10 p.m. each night, the outlet timer cuts\noﬀ the power to the router .

Whenever I’m looking to cut calories,\nfor example, I will ask the waiter to split my meal and box\nhalf of it to go before  the meal is served. If I waited until\nthe meal came out and told myself “I’ll just eat half ,” it\nwould never work.\nThe key is to change the task such that it requires more\nwork to get out of the good habit than to get started on it.\nIf you’re feeling motivated to get in shape, schedule a yoga\nsession and pay ahead of time. If you’re excited about the\nbusiness you want to start, email an entrepreneur you\nrespect and set up a consulting call. When the time comes\nto act, the only way to bail is to cancel the meeting, which\nrequires eﬀort and may cost money .\nCommitment devices increase the odds that you’ll do the\nright thing in the future by making bad habits diﬀicult in\nthe present. However , we can do even better . We can make\ngood habits inevitable and bad habits impossible.\nHOW TO A UTOMA TE A HABIT AND NEVER THINK\nABOUT IT AGAIN\nJohn Henry P atterson was born in Dayton, Ohio, in 1844.\nHe spent his childhood doing chores on the family farm and\nworking shifts at his father’s sawmill.

The store faced little\ncompetition and enjoyed a steady stream of customers, but\nstill struggled to make money .

A t 10 p.m. each night, the outlet timer cuts\noﬀ the power to the router . When the internet goes oﬀ ,\neveryone knows it is time to go to bed.\nCommitment devices are useful because they enable you\nto take advantage of good intentions before you can fall\nvictim to temptation. Whenever I’m looking to cut calories,\nfor example, I will ask the waiter to split my meal and box\nhalf of it to go before  the meal is served. If I waited until\nthe meal came out and told myself “I’ll just eat half ,” it\nwould never work.\nThe key is to change the task such that it requires more\nwork to get out of the good habit than to get started on it.\nIf you’re feeling motivated to get in shape, schedule a yoga\nsession and pay ahead of time. If you’re excited about the\nbusiness you want to",

Unless you were willing to hover over your\nemployees every minute of the day , or to manage all\ntransactions yourself , it was diﬀicult to prevent theft.\nAs Patterson mulled over his predicament, he came\nacross an advertisement for a new invention called Ritty’s\nIncorruptible Cashier . Designed by fellow Dayton resident\nJames Ritty , it was the ﬁrst cash register . The machine\nautomatically locked the cash and receipts inside after each\ntransaction. P atterson bought two for ﬁfty dollars each.\nEmployee theft at his store vanished overnight. In the\nnext six months, Patterson’s business went from losing\nmoney to making $5,000 in proﬁt—the equivalent of more\nthan $100,000 today .\nPatterson was so impressed with the machine that he\nchanged businesses. He bought the rights to Ritty’s\ninvention and opened the National Cash Register Company .\nTen years later , National Cash Register had over one\nthousand employees and was on its way to becoming one of\nthe most successful businesses of its time.\nThe best way to break a bad habit is to make it\nimpractical to do . Increase the friction until you don’t even\nhave the option to act. The brilliance of the cash register\nwas that it automated ethical behavior by making stealing\npractically impossible. R ather than trying to change the\nemployees, it made the preferred behavior automatic.\nSome actions—like installing a cash register—pay oﬀ\nagain and again. These onetime choices require a little bit\nof eﬀort up front but create increasing value over time. I’m\nfascinated by the idea that a single choice can deliver\nreturns again and again, and I surveyed my readers on\ntheir favorite onetime actions that lead to better long-term\nhabits. The table on the following page shares some of the\nmost popular answers.\nI’d wager that if the average person were to simply do\nhalf of the onetime actions on this list—even if they didn’t\ngive another thought to their habits—most would ﬁnd\nthemselves living a better life a year from now . These\nonetime actions are a straightforward way to employ the\n3rd Law of Behavior Change. They make it easier to sleep\nwell, eat healthy , be productive, save money , and generally\nlive better .\nONETIME ACTIONS THA T LOCK IN GOOD HABITS\nNutrition\nBuy a water ﬁlter to clean your drinking water .\nUse smaller plates to r educe caloric intak e.\nSleep\nBuy a good mattr ess.\nGet black out curtains.\nRemove your television fr om your bedr oom.\nProductivity\nUnsubscribe fr om emails.\nTurn oﬀ notiﬁcations and mute gr oup chats.\nSet your phone to silent.\nUse email ﬁlters to clear up your inbo x.\nDelete games and social media apps on your phone.\nHappiness\nGet a dog.\nMove to a friendly, social neighbor hood.\nGeneral Health\nGet vaccinated.\nBuy good shoes to avoid back pain.\nBuy a supportive chair or standing desk.\nFinance\nEnroll in an automatic savings plan.\nSet up automatic bill pay .\nCut cable service.\nAsk service pr oviders to lower your bills.\nOf course, there are many ways to automate good habits\nand eliminate bad ones. Typically , they involve putting\ntechnology to work for you. T echnology can transform\nactions that were once hard, annoying, and complicated\ninto behaviors that are easy , painless, and simple. It is the\nmost reliable and eﬀective way to guarantee the right\nbehavior .\nThis is particularly useful for behaviors that happen too\ninfrequently to become habitual. Things you have to do\nmonthly or yearly—like rebalancing your investment\nportfolio—are never repeated frequently enough to become\na habit, so they beneﬁt in particular from technology\n“remembering” to do them for you.\nOther examples include:\nMedicine: Prescriptions can be automatically reﬁlled.\nPersonal ﬁnance: Employees can save for retirement\nwith an automatic wage deduction.\nCooking: Meal-delivery services can do your grocery\nshopping.\nProductivity: Social media browsing can be cut oﬀ with\na website blocker .\nWhen you automate as much of your life as possible, you\ncan spend your eﬀort on the tasks machines cannot do yet.\nEach habit that we hand over to the authority of technology\nfrees up time and energy to pour into the next stage of\ngrowth. As mathematician and philosopher Alfred North\nWhitehead wrote, “ Civilization advances by extending the\nnumber of operations we can perform without thinking\nabout them.”\nOf course, the power of technology can work",

Unless you were willing to hover over your\nemployees every minute of the day , or to manage all\ntransactions yourself , it was diﬀicult to prevent theft.\nAs Patterson mulled over his predicament, he came\nacross an advertisement for a new invention called Ritty’s\nIncorruptible Cashier . Designed by fellow Dayton resident\nJames Ritty , it was the ﬁrst cash register . The machine\nautomatically locked the cash and receipts inside after each\ntransaction. P atterson bought two for ﬁfty dollars each.\nEmployee theft at his store vanished overnight. In the\nnext six months, Patterson’s business went from losing\nmoney to making $5,000 in proﬁt—the equivalent of more\nthan $100,000 today .\nPatterson was so impressed with the machine that he\nchanged businesses. He bought the rights to Ritty’s\ninvention and opened the National Cash Register Company .\nTen years later , National Cash Register had over one\nthousand employees and was on its way to becoming one of\nthe most successful businesses of its time.\nThe best way to break a bad habit is to make it\nimpractical to do . Increase the friction until you don’t even\nhave the option to act. The brilliance of the cash register\nwas that it automated ethical behavior by making stealing\npractically impossible. R ather than trying to change the\nemployees, it made the preferred behavior automatic.\nSome actions—like installing a cash register—pay oﬀ\nagain and again. These onetime choices require a little bit\nof eﬀort up front but create increasing value over time. I’m\nfascinated by the idea that a single choice can deliver\nreturns again and again, and I surveyed my readers on\ntheir favorite onetime actions that lead to better long-term\nhabits. The table on the following page shares some of the\nmost popular answers.\nI’d wager that if the average person were to simply do\nhalf of the onetime actions on this list—even if they didn’t\ngive another thought to their habits—most would ﬁnd\nthemselves living a better life a year from now . These\nonetime actions are a straightforward way to employ the\n3rd Law of Behavior Change. They make it easier to sleep\nwell, eat healthy , be productive,",

Typically , they involve putting\ntechnology to work for you. T echnology can transform\nactions that were once hard, annoying, and complicated\ninto behaviors that are easy , painless, and simple. It is the\nmost reliable and eﬀective way to guarantee the right\nbehavior .\nThis is particularly useful for behaviors that happen too\ninfrequently to become habitual. Things you have to do\nmonthly or yearly—like rebalancing your investment\nportfolio—are never repeated frequently enough to become\na habit, so they beneﬁt in particular from technology\n“remembering” to do them for you.\nOther examples include:\nMedicine: Prescriptions can be automatically reﬁlled.\nPersonal ﬁnance: Employees can save for retirement\nwith an automatic wage deduction.\nCooking: Meal-delivery services can do your grocery\nshopping.\nProductivity: Social media browsing can be cut oﬀ with\na website blocker .\nWhen you automate as much of your life as possible, you\ncan spend your eﬀort on the tasks machines cannot do yet.\nEach habit that we hand over to the authority of technology\nfrees up time and energy",

    "text": " to pour into the next stage of\ngrowth. As mathematician and philosopher Alfred North\nWhitehead wrote, “ Civilization advances by extending the\nnumber of operations we can perform without thinking\nabout them.”\nOf course, the power of technology can work against us\nas well. Binge-watching becomes a habit because you have\nto put more eﬀort in to stop looking at the screen than to\ncontinue doing so . Instead of pressing a button to advance\nto the next episode, Netﬂix or Y ouTube will autoplay it for\nyou. All you have to do is keep your eyes open.\nTechnology creates a level of convenience that enables\nyou to act on your smallest whims and desires. A t the mere\nsuggestion of hunger , you can have food delivered to your\ndoor. At the slightest hint of boredom, you can get lost in\nthe vast expanse of social media. When the eﬀort required\nto act on your desires becomes eﬀectively zero, you can\nﬁnd yourself slipping into whatever impulse arises at the\nmoment. The downside of automation is that we can ﬁnd\nourselves jumping from easy task to easy task without\nmaking time for more diﬀicult, but ultimately more\nrewarding, work.\nI often ﬁnd myself gravitating toward social media\nduring any downtime. If I feel bored for just a fraction of a\nsecond, I reach for my phone. It’s easy to write oﬀ these\nminor distractions as “just taking a break,” but over time\nthey can accumulate into a serious issue. The constant tug\nof “just one more minute” can prevent me from doing\nanything of consequence. (I’m not the only one. The\naverage person spends over two hours per day on social\nmedia. What could you do with an extra six hundred hours\nper year?)\nDuring the year I was writing this book, I experimented\nwith a new time management strategy . Every Monday , my\nassistant would reset the passwords on all my social media\naccounts, which logged me out on each device. All week I\nworked without distraction. On Friday , she would send me\nthe new passwords. I had the entire weekend to enjoy what\nsocial media had to oﬀer until Monday morning when she\nwould do it again. (If you don’t have an assistant, team up\nwith a friend or family member and reset each other’s\npasswords each week.)\nOne of the biggest surprises was how quickly I adapted.\nWithin the ﬁrst week of locking myself out of social media, I\nrealized that I didn’t need to check it nearly as often as I\nhad been, and I certainly didn’t need it each day . It had\nsimply been so easy that it had become the default. Once\nmy bad habit became impossible, I discovered that I did\nactually have the motivation to work on more meaningful\ntasks. A fter I removed the mental candy from my\nenvironment, it became much easier to eat the healthy\nstuﬀ.\nWhen working in your favor , automation can make your\ngood habits inevitable and your bad habits impossible. It is\nthe ultimate way to lock in future behavior rather than\nrelying on willpower in the moment. By utilizing\ncommitment devices, strategic onetime decisions, and\ntechnology , you can create an environment of inevitability—\na space where good habits are not just an outcome you\nhope for but an outcome that is virtually guaranteed.\nChapter Summary\nThe inversion of the 3rd Law of Behavior Change is\nmake it diﬀicult .\nA commitment device is a choice you make in the\npresent that locks in better behavior in the future.\nThe ultimate way to lock in future behavior is to\nautomate your habits.\nOnetime choices—like buying a better mattress or\nenrolling in an automatic savings plan—are single\nactions that automate your future habits and deliver\nincreasing returns over time.\nUsing technology to automate your habits is the most\nreliable and eﬀective way to guarantee the right\nbehavior .\nHOW TO CREA TE A GOOD HABIT\nThe 1st Law: Mak e It Obvious\n1.1: Fill out the Habits Scor ecard. Write down your cur rent habits to become\nawar e of them.\n1.2: Use implementation intentions: “I will [BEHA VIOR] at [TIME] in\n[LOCATION].”\n1.3: Use habit stacking: “After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”\n1.4: Design your envir onment. Mak e the cues of good habits obvious and\nvisible.\nThe 2nd Law: Mak e It Attractive\n2.1: Use temptation bundling. P air an action you want  to do with an action you\nneed  to do .\n",

    "text": " to pour into the next stage of\ngrowth. As mathematician and philosopher Alfred North\nWhitehead wrote, “ Civilization advances by extending the\nnumber of operations we can perform without thinking\nabout them.”\nOf course, the power of technology can work against us\nas well. Binge-watching becomes a habit because you have\nto put more eﬀort in to stop looking at the screen than to\ncontinue doing so . Instead of pressing a button to advance\nto the next episode, Netﬂix or Y ouTube will autoplay it for\nyou. All you have to do is keep your eyes open.\nTechnology creates a level of convenience that enables\nyou to act on your smallest whims and desires. A t the mere\nsuggestion of hunger , you can have food delivered to your\ndoor. At the slightest hint of boredom, you can get lost in\nthe vast expanse of social media. When the eﬀort required\nto act on your desires becomes eﬀectively zero, you can\nﬁnd yourself slipping into whatever impulse arises at the\nmoment. The downside of automation is that we can ﬁnd\nourselves jumping from easy task to easy task without\nmaking time for more diﬀicult, but ultimately more\nrewarding, work.\nI often ﬁnd myself gravitating toward social media\nduring any downtime. If I feel bored for just a fraction of a\nsecond, I reach for my phone. It’s easy to write oﬀ these\nminor distractions as “just taking a break,” but over time\nthey can accumulate into a serious issue. The constant tug\nof “just one more minute” can prevent me from doing\nanything of consequence. (I’m not the only one. The\naverage person spends over two hours per day on social\nmedia. What could you do with an extra six hundred hours\nper year?)\nDuring the year I was writing this book, I experimented\nwith a new time management strategy . Every Monday , my\nassistant would reset the passwords on all my social media\naccounts, which logged me out on each device. All week I\nworked without distraction. On Friday , she would send me\nthe new passwords. I had the entire weekend to enjoy what\nsocial media had to oﬀer until Monday morning when she\nwould do it again. (If you don’t have an assistant, team up\nwith a friend or family member and reset each other",

As mathematician and philosopher Alfred North\nWhitehead wrote, “ Civilization advances by extending the\nnumber of operations we can perform without thinking\nabout them.”\nOf course, the power of technology can work against us\nas well. Binge-watching becomes a habit because you have\nto put more eﬀort in to stop looking at the screen than to\ncontinue doing so . Instead of pressing a button to advance\nto the next episode, Netﬂix or Y ouTube will autoplay it for\nyou. All you have to do is keep your eyes open.\nTechnology creates a level of convenience that enables\nyou to act on your smallest whims and desires. A t the mere\nsuggestion of hunger , you can have food delivered to your\ndoor. At the slightest hint of boredom, you can get lost in\nthe vast expanse of social media. When the eﬀort required\nto act on your desires becomes eﬀectively zero, you can\nﬁnd yourself slipping into whatever impulse arises at the\nmoment. The downside of automation is that we can ﬁnd\nourselves jumping from easy task to easy task without\nmaking time for more",

What could you do with an extra six hundred hours\nper year?)\nDuring the year I was writing this book, I experimented\nwith a new time management strategy . Every Monday , my\nassistant would reset the passwords on all my social media\naccounts, which logged me out on each device. All week I\nworked without distraction.

(If you don’t have an assistant, team up\nwith a friend or family member and reset each other’s\npasswords each week.)\nOne of the biggest surprises was how quickly I adapted.\nWithin the ﬁrst week of locking myself out of social media, I\nrealized that I didn’t need to check it nearly as often as I\nhad been, and I certainly didn’t need it each day . It had\nsimply been so easy that it had become the default. Once\nmy bad habit became impossible, I discovered that I did\nactually have the motivation to work on more meaningful\ntasks. A fter I removed the mental candy from my\nenvironment, it became much easier to eat the healthy\nstuﬀ.\nWhen working in your favor , automation can make your\ngood habits inevitable and your bad habits impossible. It is\nthe ultimate way to lock in future behavior rather than\nrelying on willpower in the moment. By utilizing\ncommitment devices, strategic onetime decisions, and\ntechnology , you can create an environment of inevitability—\na space where good habits are not just an outcome you\nhope for but an outcome that is virtually guaranteed.\nChapter Summary\nThe inversion of the 3rd Law of Behavior Change is\nmake it diﬀicult .\nA commitment device is a choice you make in the\npresent that locks in better behavior in the future.\nThe ultimate way to lock in future behavior is to\nautomate your habits.\nOnetime choices—like buying a better mattress or\nenrolling in an automatic savings plan—are single\nactions that automate your future habits and deliver\nincreasing returns over time.\nUsing technology to automate your habits is the most\nreliable and eﬀective way to guarantee the right\nbehavior .\nHOW TO CREA TE A GOOD HABIT\nThe 1st Law: Mak e It Obvious\n1.1: Fill out the Habits Scor ecard. Write down your cur rent habits to become\nawar e of them.\n1.2: Use implementation intentions: “I will [BEHA VIOR] at [TIME] in\n[LOCATION].”\n1.3: Use habit stacking: “After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”\n1.4: Design your envir onment.
