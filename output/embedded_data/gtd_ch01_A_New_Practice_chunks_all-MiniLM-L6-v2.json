    "text": "A New Practice for a New Reality \nIT'S POSSIBLE FOR a person to have an overwhelming number of \nthings to do and still function productively with a  clear head and a \npositive sense of relaxed control. That's a great w ay to live and \nwork, at elevated levels of effectiveness and effic iency. It's also \nbecoming a critical operational style required of s uccessful and \nhigh-performing professionals. You already know how  to do \neverything necessary to achieve this high-performan ce state. If \nyou're like most people, however, you need to apply  these skills in \na more timely, complete, and systematic way so you can get on top \nof it all instead of feeling buried. And though the\nmethod and the techniques I describe in this book \nare immensely practical and based on common sense, \nmost people will have some major work habits that \nmust be modified before they can implement this \nsystem. The small changes required—changes in the \nway you clarify and organize all the things that co m- \nmand your attention—could represent a significant \nshift in how you approach some key aspects of your day-to-day \nwork. Many of my clients have referred to this as a  significant \nparadigm shift. \nThe methods I present here are all based on two key  objec- \ntives:(1) capturing all the things that need to get done—now, later, \nsomeday, big, little, or in between—into a logical and trusted sys- \ntem outside of your head and off your mind; and (2)  disciplining \nyourself to make front-end decisions about all of m e \"inputs\" you \n3Anxiety is caused \nby a lack of control, \norganization, \npreparation, and \naction. \n.  —David \n4THE ART OF GETTING THINGS DONE  |  PART ONE \nlet into your life so that you will always have a p lan for \"next \nactions\" that you can implement or renegotiate at a ny moment. \nThis book offers a proven method for this kind of h igh- \nperformance workflow management. It provides good t ools, tips, \ntechniques, and tricks for implementation. As you'l l discover, the \nprinciples and methods are instantly usable and app licable to \neverything you have to do in your personal as well as your profes- \nsional life.* You can incorporate, as many others h ave before you, \nwhat I describe as an ongoing dynamic style of oper ating in your \nwork and in your world. Or, like still others, you can simply use \nthis as a guide to getting back into better control  when you feel \nyou need to. \nThe Problem: New Demands, \nInsufficient Resources \nAlmost everyone I encounter these days feels he or she has too \nmuch to handle and not enough time to get it all do ne. In the \ncourse of a single recent week, I consulted with a partner in a \nmajor global investment firm who was concerned that  the new \ncorporate-management responsibilities he was being offered \nwould stress his family commitments beyond the limi ts; and with \na midlevel human-resources manager trying to stay o n top of her \n150-plus e-mail requests per day fueled by the goal  of doubling \nthe company's regional office staff from eleven hun dred to two \nthousand people in one year, all as she tried to pr otect a social life \nfor herself on the weekends. \nA paradox has emerged in this new millennium: peopl e have \n*I consider \"work,\" in its most universal sense, as  meaning anything that you \nwant or need to be different than it currently is. Many people make a distinc- \ntion between \"work\" and \"personal life,\" but I don' t: to me, weeding the garden \nor updating my will is just as much \"work\" as writi ng this book or coaching a \nclient. All the methods and techniques in this book  are applicable across that \nlife/work spectrum—to be effective, they need to be . \nCHAPTER 1   |  A NEW PRACTICE FOR A NEW REALITY \nenhanced quality of life, but at the same time they  are adding to \ntheir stress levels by taking on more than they hav e resources to \nhandle. It's as though their eyes were bigger than their stomachs. \nAnd most people are to some degree frustrated and p erplexed \nabout how to improve the situation. \nWork No Longer Has Clear Boundaries \nA major factor in the mounting stress level is that  the \nactual nature of our jobs has changed much more dra - \nmatically and rapidly than have our training for an d \nour ability to deal with work. In just the last hal f of \nthe twentieth century, what constituted \"work\" in t he \nindustrialized world was transformed",

That's a great w ay to live and \nwork, at elevated levels of effectiveness and effic iency. It's also \nbecoming a critical operational style required of s uccessful and \nhigh-performing professionals. You already know how  to do \neverything necessary to achieve this high-performan ce state. If \nyou're like most people, however, you need to apply  these skills in \na more timely, complete, and systematic way so you can get on top \nof it all instead of feeling buried. And though the\nmethod and the techniques I describe in this book \nare immensely practical and based on common sense, \nmost people will have some major work habits that \nmust be modified before they can implement this \nsystem. The small changes required—changes in the \nway you clarify and organize all the things that co m- \nmand your attention—could represent a significant \nshift in how you approach some key aspects of your day-to-day \nwork. Many of my clients have referred to this as a  significant \nparadigm shift. \nThe methods I present here are all based on two key  objec- \ntives:(1) capturing all the things that need to get done—now, later, \nsomeday, big, little, or in between—into a logical and trusted sys- \ntem outside of your head and off your mind; and (2)  disciplining \nyourself to make front-end decisions about all of m e \"inputs\" you \n3Anxiety is caused \nby a lack of control, \norganization, \npreparation, and \naction. \n.  —David \n4THE ART OF GETTING THINGS DONE  |  PART ONE \nlet into your life so that you will always have a p lan for \"next \nactions\" that you can implement or renegotiate at a ny moment. \nThis book offers a proven method for this kind of h igh- \nperformance workflow management. It provides good t ools, tips, \ntechniques, and tricks for implementation. As you'l l discover, the \nprinciples and methods are instantly usable and app licable to \neverything you have to do in your personal as well as your profes- \nsional life.* You can incorporate,",

    "text": " more dra - \nmatically and rapidly than have our training for an d \nour ability to deal with work. In just the last hal f of \nthe twentieth century, what constituted \"work\" in t he \nindustrialized world was transformed from assembly-\nline, make-it and move-it kinds of activity to what\nPeter Drucker has so aptly termed \"knowledge work.\"\nIn the old days, work was self-evident. Fields \nwere to be plowed, machines tooled, boxes packed, \ncows milked, widgets cranked. You knew what work ha d to be \ndone—you could see it. It was clear when the work w as finished, \nor not finished. \nNow, for many of us, there are no edges to most of our proj- \nects. Most people I know have at least half a dozen  things they're \ntrying to achieve right now, and even if they had t he \nrest of their lives to try, they wouldn't be able t o finish \nthese to perfection. You're probably faced with the\nsame dilemma. How good could that conference \npotentially be? How effective could the training pr o- \ngram be, or the structure of your executives' compe n- \nsation package? How inspiring is the essay you're \nwriting? How motivating the staff meeting? How \nfunctional the reorganization? And a last question:\nHow much available data could be relevant to doing those proj- \nects \"better\"? The answer is, an infinite amount, e asily accessible, \nor at least potentially so, through the Web. \nOn another front, the lack of edges can create more work \n5Time is the \nquality of nature \nthat keeps events \nfrom happening all \nat once. Lately it \ndoesn't seem to be \nworking. \n—Anonymous \nAlmost every \nproject could be \ndone better, and an \ninfinite quantity of\ninformation is now \navailable that could \nmake that happen.\nTHE ART OF GETTING THINGS DONE  I  PART ONE \nfor everyone. Many of today's organizational outcom es require \ncross-divisional communication, cooperation, and en gagement. \nOur individual office silos are crumbling, and with  them is going \nthe luxury of not having to read cc'd e-mails from the marketing \ndepartment, or from human resources, or from some a d hoc, deal- \nwith-a-certain-issue committee. \nOur Jobs Keep Changing \nThe disintegrating edges of our projects and our wo rk in general \nwould be challenging enough for anyone. But now we must add \nto that equation the constantly shifting definition  of our jobs. I \noften ask in my seminars, \"Which of you are doing o nly what you \nwere hired to do?\" Seldom do I get a raised hand. A s amorphous \nas edgeless work may be, if you had the chance to s tick with some \nspecifically described job long enough, you'd proba bly figure out \nwhat you needed to do—how much, at what level—to st ay \nsane. \nBut few have that luxury anymore, for two reasons: \nWe can never \nreally be prepared \nfor that which is \nwholly new. We \nhave to adjust  , •\nourselves, and \nevery radical \nadjustment is a \ncrisis in self- \nesteem: we undergo \na test, we have to \nprove ourselves. It \nneeds subordinate \nself-confidence to \nface drastic change \nwithout inner \ntrembling. \n—Eric \nHoffer 1 |  The organizations we're involved with seem to \nbe in constant morph mode, with ever-changing \ngoals, products, partners, customers, markets, \ntechnologies, and owners. These all, by neces- \nsity, shake up structures, forms, roles, and \nresponsibilities. \n2 |  The average professional is more of a free agen t \nthese days than ever before, changing careers as \noften as his or her parents once changed jobs. \nEven fortysomethings and fiftysomethings hold \nto standards of continual growth. Their aims are \njust more integrated into the mainstream now, \ncovered by the catchall \"professional, manage- \nment, and executive development\"—which sim- \nply means they won't keep doing what they're \ndoing for any extended period of time. \n6\nCHAPTER 1   I  A NEW PRACTICE FOR A NEW REALITY \nLittle seems clear for very long anymore, as far as  what our \nwork is and what or how much input may be relevant \nto doing it well. We're allowing in huge amounts of\ninformation and communication from the outer \nworld and generating an equally large volume of \nideas and agreements with ourselves and others from\nour inner world. And we haven't been well equipped to deal with \nthis huge number",

In just the last hal f of \nthe twentieth century, what constituted \"work\" in t he \nindustrialized world was transformed from assembly-\nline, make-it and move-it kinds of activity to what\nPeter Drucker has so aptly termed \"knowledge work.\"\nIn the old days, work was self-evident. Fields \nwere to be plowed, machines tooled, boxes packed, \ncows milked, widgets cranked. You knew what work ha d to be \ndone—you could see it. It was clear when the work w as finished, \nor not finished. \nNow, for many of us, there are no edges to most of our proj- \nects. Most people I know have at least half a dozen  things they're \ntrying to achieve right now, and even if they had t he \nrest of their lives to try, they wouldn't be able t o finish \nthese to perfection. You're probably faced with the\nsame dilemma. How good could that conference \npotentially be? How effective could the training pr o- \ngram be, or the structure of your executives' compe n- \nsation package? How inspiring is the essay you're \nwriting? How motivating the staff meeting? How \nfunctional the reorganization? And a last question:\nHow much available data could be relevant to doing those proj- \nects \"better\"? The answer is, an infinite amount, e asily accessible, \nor at least potentially so, through the Web. \nOn another front, the lack of edges can create more work \n5Time is the \nquality of nature \nthat keeps events \nfrom happening all \nat once. Lately it \ndoesn't seem to be \nworking. \n—Anonymous \nAlmost every \nproject could be \ndone better, and an \ninfinite quantity of\ninformation is now \navailable that could \nmake that happen.\nTHE ART OF GETTING THINGS DONE  I  PART ONE \nfor everyone. Many of today's organizational outcom es require \ncross-divisional communication, cooperation, and en gagement. \nOur individual office silos are crumbling, and with  them is going \nthe luxury of not having to read cc'd e-mails from the marketing \ndepartment, or from human resources, or from some a d hoc, deal- \nwith-a-certain-issue committee. \nOur Jobs",

But now we must add \nto that equation the constantly shifting definition  of our jobs. I \noften ask in my seminars, \"Which of you are doing o nly what you \nwere hired to do?\" Seldom do I get a raised hand.

Their aims are \njust more integrated into the mainstream now, \ncovered by the catchall \"professional, manage- \nment, and executive development\"—which sim- \nply means they won't keep doing what they're \ndoing for any extended period of time. \n6\nCHAPTER 1   I  A NEW PRACTICE FOR A NEW REALITY \nLittle seems clear for very long anymore, as far as  what our \nwork is and what or how much input may be relevant \nto doing it well.

And we haven't been well equipped to deal with \nthis huge number of internal and external commitmen ts. \nThe Old Models and Habits Are Insufficient \nNeither our standard education, nor traditional tim e-management \nmodels, nor the plethora of organizing tools availa ble, such as \npersonal notebook planners, Microsoft Outlook, or P alm per- \nsonal digital assistants (PDAs), has given us a via ble means of \nmeeting the new demands placed on us. If you've tri ed to use any \nof these processes or tools, you've probably found \nthem unable to accommodate the speed, complexity, \nand changing priority factors inherent in what you \nare doing. The ability to be successful, relaxed, a nd in \ncontrol  during these  fertile  but turbulent times\ndemands new ways of thinking and working. There \nis a great need for new methods, technologies, and \nwork habits to help us get on top of our world. \nThe traditional approaches to time management and p er- \nsonal organization were useful in their time. They provided help- \nful reference points for a workforce that was just emerging from \nan industrial assembly-line modality into a new kin d of work that \nincluded choices about what to do and discretion ab out when to \ndo it. When \"time\" itself turned into a work factor , personal cal- \nendars became a key work tool. (Even as late as the  1980s many \nprofessionals considered having a pocket Day-Timer the essence \nof being organized, and many people today think of their calendar \nas the central tool for being in control.) Along wi th discretionary \ntime also came the need to make good choices about what to do. \n\"ABC\" priority codes and daily \"to-do\" lists were k ey techniques \n7The burner I go, \nthe behinder I get. \n—Anonymous \nThe winds and \nwaves are always \non the side of the \nablest navigators. \n—Edward Gibbon \n8THE ART OF GETTING THINGS DONE | PART ONE \nthat people developed to help them sort through the ir choices in \nsome meaningful way. If you had the freedom to deci de what to \ndo, you also had the responsibility to make good ch oices, given \nyour \"priorities.\" \nWhat you've probably discovered, at least at some l evel, is \nthat a calendar, though important, can really effec tively manage \nonly a small portion of what you need to organize. And daily \nto-do lists and simplified priority coding have pro ven inadequate \nto deal with the volume and variable nature of the average profes- \nsional's workload. More and more people's jobs are made up of \ndozens or even hundreds of e-mails a day, with no l atitude left to \nignore a single request, complaint, or order. There  are few people \nwho can (or even should) expect to code everything an \"A,\" a \"B,\" \nor a \"C\" priority, or who can maintain some predete rmined list of \nto-dos that the first telephone call or interruptio n from their boss \nwon't totally undo. \nThe \"Big Picture\" vs. the Nitty-Gritty \nAt the other end of the spectrum, a huge number of business \nbooks, models, seminars, and gurus have championed the \"bigger \nview\" as the solution to dealing with our complex w orld. Clarify- \ning major goals and values, so the thinking goes, g ives order, \nmeaning, and direction to our work. In practice, ho wever, the \nwell-intentioned exercise of values thinking too of ten does not \nachieve its desired results. I have seen too many o f these efforts \nfail, for one or more of the following three reason s: \n1 |   There is too much distraction at the day-to-da y, hour-to- \nhour level of commitments to allow for appropriate focus on \nthe higher levels. \n2 |   Ineffective personal organizational systems cr eate huge sub- \nconscious resistance to undertaking even bigger pro jects and \ngoals that will likely not be managed well, and tha t will in \nturn cause even more distraction and stress. \n3 |   When loftier levels and values actually are clarified, it raises \nCHAPTER 1 | A NEW PRACTICE FOR A NEW REALITY \nthe bar of our standards, making us notice that \nmuch more that needs changing. We are already \nhaving a serious negative reaction to the over- \nwhelming number of things we have to do. And \nwhat created much of the work that's on those \nlists in the first place? Our values!

There \nis a great need for new methods, technologies, and \nwork habits to help us get on top of our world. \nThe traditional approaches to time management and p er- \nsonal organization were useful in their time. They provided help- \nful reference points for a workforce that was just emerging from \nan industrial assembly-line modality into a new kin d of work that \nincluded choices about what to do and discretion ab out when to \ndo it. When \"time\" itself turned into a work factor , personal cal- \nendars became a key work tool. (Even as late as the  1980s many \nprofessionals considered having a pocket Day-Timer the essence \nof being organized, and many people today think of their calendar \nas the central tool for being in control.) Along wi th discretionary \ntime also came the need to make good choices about what to do. \n\"ABC\" priority codes and daily \"to-do\" lists were k ey techniques \n7The burner I go, \nthe behinder I get. \n—Anonymous \nThe winds and \nwaves are always \non the side of the \nablest navigators. \n—Edward Gibbon \n8THE ART OF GETTING THINGS DONE | PART ONE",

Our values! Focusing on values \ndoes not simplify \nyour life. It gives \nmeaning and \ndirection—and a \nlot \nmore complexity. \nFocusing on primary outcomes and values is a critical exer- \ncise, certainly. But it does not mean there is less  to do, or fewer \nchallenges in getting the work done. Quite the cont rary: it just \nups the ante in the game, which still must be playe d day to day. \nFor a human-resources executive, for example, decid ing to deal \nwith quality-of-work-life issues in order to attrac t and keep key \ntalent does not make things simpler. \nThere has been a missing piece in our new culture o f knowl- \nedge work: a system with a coherent set of behavior s and tools \nthat functions effectively at the level at which wo rk really hap- \npens. It must incorporate the results of big-pictur e thinking \nas well as the smallest of open details. It must ma nage multi- \nple tiers of priorities. It must maintain control o ver hundreds \nof new inputs daily. It must save a lot more time a nd effort than \nare needed to maintain it. It must make it easier t o get things \ndone. \nThe Promise: The \"Ready State\" \nof the Martial Artist \nReflect for a moment on what it actually might be l ike if your per- \nsonal management situation were totally under contr ol, at all lev- \nels and at all times. What if you could dedicate fu lly 100 percent \nof your attention to whatever was at hand, at your own choosing, \nwith no distraction? \nIt is possible. There is a way to get a grip on it all, stay \nrelaxed, and get meaningful things done with minima l effort, \n9\nTHE ART OF GETTING THINGS DONE  I  PART ONE \nLife is denied by \nlack of attention, \n whether it be to \ncleaning windows \nor trying to write \na masterpiece. .\n—\nNadia \nBoulanger \nYour ability to \ngenerate power is \ndirectly proportional\nto your ability to \nrelax. across the whole spectrum of your life and work. Yo u \ncan experience what the martial artists call a \"mind \nlike water\" and top athletes refer to as the \"zone, \" \nwithin the complex world in which you're engaged. \nIn fact, you have probably already been in this sta te \nfrom time to time. \nIt's a condition of working, doing, and being in \nwhich the mind is clear and constructive things are\nhappening. It's a state that is accessible by every one, \nand one that is increasingly needed to deal effecti vely \nwith the complexity of life in the twenty-first cen tury. \nMore and more it will be a required condition for \nhigh-performance professionals who wish to maintain\nbalance and a consistent positive output in their w ork. \nWorld-class rower Craig Lambert has described how \nit feels in Mind Over Water (Houghton Miffin, 1998): \n10 Rowers have a word for this frictionless state: swi ng. . . . Recall \nthe pure joy of riding on a backyard swing: an easy  cycle of \nmotion, the momentum coming from the swing itself. The swing \ncarries us; we do not force it. We pump our legs to  drive our arc \nhigher, but gravity does most of the work. We are n ot so much \nswinging as being swung. The boat swings you. The s hell wants \nto move fast: Speed sings in its lines and nature. Our job is \nsimply to work with the shell, to stop holding it b ack with our \nthrashing struggles to go faster. Trying too hard s abotages boat \nspeed. Trying becomes striving and striving undoes itself Social \nclimbers strive to be aristocrats but their efforts  prove them no \nsuch thing. Aristocrats do not strive; they have al ready arrived. \nSwing is a state of arrival. \nThe \"Mind Like Water\" Simile \nIn karate there is an image that's used to define t he position of \nperfect readiness: \"mind like water.\" Imagine throw ing a pebble \ninto a still pond. How does the water respond? The answer is, \nCHAPTER 1  I A NEW PRACTICE FOR A NEW REALITY \ntotally appropriately to the force and mass of the \ninput; then it returns to calm.

Yo u \ncan experience what the martial artists call a \"mind \nlike water\" and top athletes refer to as the \"zone, \" \nwithin the complex world in which you're engaged. \nIn fact, you have probably already been in this sta te \nfrom time to time. \nIt's a condition of working, doing, and being in \nwhich the mind is clear and constructive things are\nhappening. It's a state that is accessible by every one, \nand one that is increasingly needed to deal effecti vely \nwith the complexity of life in the twenty-first cen tury. \nMore and more it will be a required condition for \nhigh-performance professionals who wish to maintain\nbalance and a consistent positive output in their w ork. \nWorld-class rower Craig Lambert has described how \nit feels in Mind Over Water (Houghton Miffin, 1998): \n10 Rowers have a word for this frictionless state: swi ng. . . . Recall \nthe pure joy of riding on a backyard swing: an easy  cycle of \nmotion, the momentum coming from the swing itself. The swing \ncarries us; we do not force it. We pump our legs to  drive our arc \nhigher, but gravity does most of the work. We are n ot so much \nswinging as being swung. The boat swings you. The s hell wants \nto move fast: Speed sings in its lines and nature. Our job is \nsimply to work with the shell, to stop holding it b ack with our \nthrashing struggles to go faster. Trying too hard s abotages boat \nspeed. Trying becomes striving and striving undoes itself Social \nclimbers strive to be aristocrats but their efforts  prove them no \nsuch thing. Aristocrats do not strive; they have al ready arrived. \nSwing is a state of arrival. \nThe \"Mind Like Water\" Simile \nIn karate there is an image that's used to define t he position of \nperfect readiness: \"mind like water.\" Imagine throw ing a pebble \ninto a still pond. How does the water respond? The answer is, \nCHAPTER 1  I A NEW PRACTICE FOR A NEW REALITY \ntot",

    "text": "-class rower Craig Lambert has described how \nit feels in Mind Over Water (Houghton Miffin, 1998): \n10 Rowers have a word for this frictionless state: swi ng. . . . Recall \nthe pure joy of riding on a backyard swing: an easy  cycle of \nmotion, the momentum coming from the swing itself. The swing \ncarries us; we do not force it. We pump our legs to  drive our arc \nhigher, but gravity does most of the work. We are n ot so much \nswinging as being swung. The boat swings you. The s hell wants \nto move fast: Speed sings in its lines and nature. Our job is \nsimply to work with the shell, to stop holding it b ack with our \nthrashing struggles to go faster. Trying too hard s abotages boat \nspeed. Trying becomes striving and striving undoes itself Social \nclimbers strive to be aristocrats but their efforts  prove them no \nsuch thing. Aristocrats do not strive; they have al ready arrived. \nSwing is a state of arrival. \nThe \"Mind Like Water\" Simile \nIn karate there is an image that's used to define t he position",

It doesn't overreac t or \nunderreact. \nThe power in a karate punch comes from speed, \nnot muscle; it comes from a focused \"pop\" at the en d \nof the whip. That's why petite people can learn to \nbreak boards and bricks with their hands: it doesn' t \ntake calluses or brute strength, just the ability t o gen- \nerate a focused thrust with speed. But a tense musc le is a slow one. \nSo the high levels of training in the martial arts teach and demand \nbalance and relaxation as much as anything else. Cl earing the \nmind and being flexible are key. \nAnything that causes you to overreact or under- \nreact can control you, and often does. Responding \ninappropriately to your e-mail, your staff, your pr oj- \nects, your unread magazines, your thoughts about \nwhat you need to do, your children, or your boss wi ll \nlead to less effective results than you'd like. Mos t \npeople give either more or less attention to things\nthan they deserve, simply because they don't operat e \nwith a \"mind like water.\" \nCan You Get into Your \"Productive State\" \nWhen Required? \nThink about the last time you felt highly productiv e. \nYou probably had a sense of being in control; you \nwere not stressed out; you were highly focused on \nwhat you were doing; time tended to disappear \n(lunchtime already?); and you felt you were making \nnoticeable progress toward a meaningful outcome. \nWould you like to have more such experiences? \nAnd if you get seriously far out of that \nstate—and start to feel out of control, stressed \nout, unfocused, bored, and stuck—do you have the \nability to get yourself back into it? That's where the \n11 If your mind is \nempty, it is always \nready for anything; \nit is open to \neverything. \n—Sbunryu Suzuki \nAnything that\ncauses you to \noverreact or \nunderreact can \ncontrol you, and \noften does.\nThere is one thing \nwe can do, and the \nhappiest people are \nthose who can do \nit to the limit of \ntheir ability. We \ncan be completely \npresent. We can \nbe all here. We \ncan . . . give all \nour attention to \nthe opportunity \nbefore us. \n—\nMark \nTHE ART OF GETTING THINGS DONE  I  PART ONE \nmethodology of Getting Things Done will have the greatest impact \non your life, by showing you how to get back to \"mi nd like water,\" \nwith all your resources and faculties functioning a t a maximum level. \nThe Principle: Dealing Effectively \nwith Internal Commitments \nA basic truism I have discovered over twenty years of coaching \nand training is that most of the stress people expe rience comes \nfrom inappropriately managed commitments they make or \naccept. Even those who are not consciously \"stresse d out\" will \ninvariably experience greater relaxation, better fo cus, and \nincreased productive energy when they learn more ef fectively to \ncontrol the \"open loops\" of their lives. \nYou've probably made many more agreements with your self \nthan you realize, and every single one of them-big or little—is \nbeing tracked by a less-than-conscious part of you.  These are the \n\"incompletes,\" or \"open loops,\" which I define as a nything pulling \nat your attention that doesn't belong where it is, the way it is. \nOpen loops can include everything from really big t o-do items \nlike \"End world hunger\" to the more modest \"Hire ne w assistant\" \nto the tiniest task such as \"Replace electric penci l sharpener.\" \nIt's likely that you also have more internal commit ments cur- \nrently in play than you're aware of. Consider how m any things you \nfeel even the smallest amount of responsibility to \nchange, finish, handle, or do something about. You \nhave a commitment, for instance, to deal in some \nway with every new communication landing in your \ne-mail, on your voice-mail, and in your in-basket. \nAnd surely there are numerous projects that you \nsense need to be defined in your areas of responsi-\nbility, as well as goals and directions to be clari fied, a \ncareer to be managed, and life in general to be kep t in balance. \nYou have accepted some level of internal responsibi lity for every- \n12 Anything that does \nnot belong where it \nis, the way it is, is \nan \"open loop\" \npulling on your \nattention. \nCHAPTER 1  ",

Even those who are not consciously \"stresse d out\" will \ninvariably experience greater relaxation, better fo cus, and \nincreased productive energy when they learn more ef fectively to \ncontrol the \"open loops\" of their lives. \nYou've probably made many more agreements with your self \nthan you realize, and every single one of them-big or little—is \nbeing tracked by a less-than-conscious part of you.  These are the \n\"incompletes,\" or \"open loops,\" which I define as a nything pulling \nat your attention that doesn't belong where it is, the way it is. \nOpen loops can include everything from really big t o-do items \nlike \"End world hunger\" to the more modest \"Hire ne w assistant\" \nto the tiniest task such as \"Replace electric penci l sharpener.\" \nIt's likely that you also have more internal commit ments cur- \nrently in play than you're aware of. Consider how m any things you \nfeel even the smallest amount of responsibility to \nchange, finish, handle, or do something about. You \nhave a commitment, for instance, to deal in some \nway with every new communication landing in your \ne-mail, on your voice-mail, and in your in-basket. \nAnd surely there are numerous projects that you \nsense need to be defined in your areas of responsi-\nbility, as well as goals and directions to be clari fied, a \ncareer to be managed, and life in general to be kep t in balance. \nYou have",

That  may seem \nlike a simple thing to do, but in practice most peo ple don't know \nhow to do it in a consistent way. \nThe Basic Requirements for Managing Commitments \nManaging commitments well requires the implementati on of \nsome basic activities and behaviors: \n• First of all, if it's on your mind, your mind isn't  clear. Anything \nyou consider unfinished in any way must be captured  in a trusted \nsystem outside your mind, or what I call a collecti on bucket, that \nyou know you'll come back to regularly and sort thr ough. \n• Second, you must clarify exactly what your commitme nt is and \ndecide what you have to do, if anything, to make pr ogress \ntoward fulfilling it. \n• Third, once you've decided on all the actions you n eed to take, \nyou must keep reminders of them organized in a syst em you \nreview regularly. \nAn Important Exercise to Test This Model \nI suggest that you write down the project or situation that is most on\nyour mind at this moment. What most \"bugs\" you, distracts you, or \ninterests you, or in some other way consumes a larg e part of your \nconscious attention? It may be a project or problem  that is really \n\"in your face,\" something you are being pressed to handle, or a \nsituation you feel you must deal with sooner rather  than later. \nMaybe you have a vacation trip coming up that you n eed to \nmake some major last-minute decisions about. Or per haps you \njust inherited six million dollars and you don't kn ow what to do \nwith the cash. Whatever. \n13 \nTHE ART OF GETTING THINGS DONE I PART ONE \nGot it? Good. Now describe, in a single written sen tence, \nyour intended successful outcome for this problem o r situation. \nIn other words, what would need to happen for you t o check \nthis \"project\" off as \"done\"? It could be as simple  as \"Take the \nHawaii vacation,\" \"Handle situation with customer X ,\" \"Resolve \ncollege situation with Susan,\" \"Clarify new divisio nal manage- \nment structure,\" or \"Implement new investment strat egy.\" All \nclear? Great. \nNow write down the very next physical action required to move \nthe situation forward. If you had nothing else to do in your life but \nget closure on this, where would you go right now, and what visi- \nble action would you take? Would you pick up a phon e and make \na call? Go to your computer and write an e-mail? Si t down with \npen and paper and brainstorm about it? Talk face-to -face with \nyour spouse, your secretary, your attorney, or your  boss? Buy nails \nat the hardware store? What? \nGot the answer to that? Good. \nWas there any value for you in these two minutes of  think- \ning? If you're like the vast majority of people who  complete that \ndrill during my seminars, you'll be experiencing at\nleast a tiny bit of enhanced control, relaxation, a nd \nfocus. You'll also be feeling more motivated to act u- \nally do something about that situation you've merely \n     been thinking about till now. Imagine that mot iva- \ntion magnified a thousandfold, as a way to live and\nwork. \nIf anything at all positive happened for you in thi s little exer- \ncise, think about this: What changed? What happened  to create that \nimproved condition within your own experience? The situation itself \nis no further along, at least in the physical world . It's certainly not \nfinished yet. What probably happened is that you ac quired a clearer \ndefinition of the outcome desired and the next acti on required. \nBut what created that? The answer is, thinking. Not a lot, just \nenough to solidify your commitment and the resource s required \nto fulfill it. \n14 Think like a man \nof action, act like a \nman of thought.'\n—Henry Bergson \nCHAPTER 1   I  A NEW PRACTICE FOR A NEW REALITY \nThe Real Work of Knowledge Work \nWelcome to the real-life experience of \"knowledge w or",

That  may seem \nlike a simple thing to do, but in practice most peo ple don't know \nhow to do it in a consistent way. \nThe Basic Requirements for Managing Commitments \nManaging commitments well requires the implementati on of \nsome basic activities and behaviors: \n• First of all, if it's on your mind, your mind isn't  clear. Anything \nyou consider unfinished in any way must be captured  in a trusted \nsystem outside your mind, or what I call a collecti on bucket, that \nyou know you'll come back to regularly and sort thr ough. \n• Second, you must clarify exactly what your commitme nt is and \ndecide what you have to do, if anything, to make pr ogress \ntoward fulfilling it. \n• Third, once you've decided on all the actions you n eed to take, \nyou must keep reminders of them organized in a syst em you \nreview regularly. \nAn Important Exercise to Test This Model \nI suggest that you write down the project or situation that is most on\nyour mind at this moment. What most \"bugs\" you, distracts you, or \ninterests you, or in some other way consumes a larg e part of your \nconscious attention? It may be a project or problem  that is really \n\"in your face,\" something you are being pressed to handle, or a \nsituation you feel you must deal with sooner rather  than later. \nMaybe you have a vacation trip coming up that you n eed to \nmake some major last-minute decisions about. Or per haps you \njust inherited six million dollars and you don't kn ow what to do \nwith the cash. Whatever. \n13 \nTHE ART OF GETTING THINGS DONE I PART ONE \nGot it? Good.

Now describe, in a single written sen tence, \nyour intended successful outcome for this problem o r situation. \nIn other words, what would need to happen for you t o check \nthis \"project\" off as \"done\"? It could be as simple  as \"Take the \nHawaii vacation,\" \"Handle situation with customer X ,\" \"Resolve \ncollege situation with Susan,\" \"Clarify new divisio nal manage- \nment structure,\" or \"Implement new investment strat egy.\" All \nclear? Great. \nNow write down the very next physical action required to move \nthe situation forward. If you had nothing else to do in your life but \nget closure on this, where would you go right now, and what visi- \nble action would you take? Would you pick up a phon e and make \na call? Go to your computer and write an e-mail? Si t down with \npen and paper and brainstorm about it? Talk face-to -face with \nyour spouse, your secretary, your attorney, or your  boss? Buy nails \nat the hardware store? What? \nGot the answer to that? Good. \nWas there any value for you in these two minutes of  think- \ning? If you're like the vast majority of people who  complete that \ndrill during my seminars, you'll be experiencing at\nleast a tiny bit of enhanced control, relaxation, a nd \nfocus. You'll also be feeling more motivated to act u- \nally do something about that situation you've merely \n     been thinking about till now. Imagine that mot iva- \ntion magnified a thousandfold, as a way to live and\nwork. \nIf anything at all positive happened for you in thi s little exer- \ncise, think about this: What changed? What happened  to create that \nimproved condition within your own experience? The situation itself \nis no further along, at least in the physical world . It's certainly not \nfinished yet. What probably happened is that you ac quired a clearer \ndefinition of the outcome desired and the next acti on required. \nBut what created that? The answer is, thinking. Not a lot, just \nenough to solidify your commitment and the resource s required \nto fulfill it. \n14 Think like a man \nof",

    "text": " action, act like a \nman of thought.'\n—Henry Bergson \nCHAPTER 1   I  A NEW PRACTICE FOR A NEW REALITY \nThe Real Work of Knowledge Work \nWelcome to the real-life experience of \"knowledge w ork,\" and a \nprofound operational principle: You have to think about your stuff \nmore than you realize but not as much as you're afr aid you might. As \nPeter Drucker has written, \"In knowledge work ... \nthe task is not given; it has to be determined. 'Wh at \nare the expected results from this work?' is ... th e \nkey question in making knowledge workers produc- \ntive. And it is a question that demands risky deci-\nsions. There is usually no right answer; there are \nchoices instead. And results have to be clearly spe ci- \nfied, if productivity is to be achieved.\" \nMost people have a resistance to initiating the bur st of \nenergy that it will take to clarify the real meanin g, for them, of \nsomething they have let into their world, and to de cide what they \nneed to do about it. We're never really taught that  we have to \nthink about our work before we can do it; much of o ur daily \nactivity is already defined for us by the undone an d unmoved \nthings staring at us when we come to work, or by th e family to be \nfed, the laundry to be done, or the children to be dressed at home. \nThinking in a concentrated manner to define desired  outcomes is \nsomething few people feel they have to do. But in t ruth, outcome \nthinking is one of the most effective means availab le for making \nwishes reality. \nWhy Things Are on Your Mind \nMost often, the reason something is \"on your mind\" is that you \nwant it to be different than it currently is, and y et: \n• you haven't clarified exactly what the intended out come is; \n• you haven't decided what the very next physical act ion step is; \nand/or \n• you haven't put reminders of the outcome and the ac tion \nrequired in a system you trust. \n15 The ancestor of \nevery action is a \nthought. \n—Ralph \nWaldo \nTHE ART OF GETTING THINGS DONE  I  PART ONE \nThat's why it's on your mind. Until those thoughts have \nbeen clarified and those decisions made, and the re sulting data \nhas been stored in a system that you absolutely know \nyou will think about as often as you need to, your \nbrain can't give up the job. You can fool everyone \nelse, but you can't fool your own mind. It knows \nwhether or not you've come to the conclusions you \nneed to, and whether you've put the resulting out- \ncomes and action reminders in a place that can be \ntrusted to resurface appropriately within your con-\nscious mind. If you haven't done those things, it \nwon't quit working overtime. Even if you've already\ndecided on the next step you'll take to resolve a p rob- \nlem, your mind can't let go until and unless you wr ite yourself \na reminder in a place it knows you will, without fail, look. It \nwill keep pressuring you about that untaken next st ep, usually \nwhen you can't do anything about it, which will jus t add to your \nstress. \n16 Your Mind Doesn't Have a Mind of Its Own \nAt least a portion of your mind is really kind of s tupid, in an interest- \ning way. If it had any innate intelligence, it woul d remind you of the \nthings you needed to do only when you could do something about them. \nDo you have a flashlight somewhere with dead batter ies in \nit? When does your mind tend to remind you that you  need new \nbatteries? When you notice the dead ones! That's no t very smart. \nIf your mind had any innate intelligence, it would remind you \nabout those dead batteries only when you passed liv e ones in a \nstore. And ones of the right size, to boot. \nBetween the time you woke up today and now, did you  think \nof anything you needed to do that you still haven't  done? Have \nyou had that thought more than once? Why? It's a wa ste of time \nand energy to keep thinking about something that yo u make no \nprogress on. And it only adds to your anxieties abo ut what you \nshould be doing and aren't. This constant, \nunproductive \npreoccupation with \nall the things we \nhave to do is the \nsingle largest \nconsumer of time \nand energy. \n—Kerry \nCHAPTER 1  [ A NEW PRACTICE FOR A NEW REALITY \nIt seems that most people let",

As \nPeter Drucker has written, \"In knowledge work ... \nthe task is not given; it has to be determined. 'Wh at \nare the expected results from this work?' is ... th e \nkey question in making knowledge workers produc- \ntive. And it is a question that demands risky deci-\nsions. There is usually no right answer; there are \nchoices instead. And results have to be clearly spe ci- \nfied, if productivity is to be achieved.\" \nMost people have a resistance to initiating the bur st of \nenergy that it will take to clarify the real meanin g, for them, of \nsomething they have let into their world, and to de cide what they \nneed to do about it. We're never really taught that  we have to \nthink about our work before we can do it; much of o ur daily \nactivity is already defined for us by the undone an d unmoved \nthings staring at us when we come to work, or by th e family to be \nfed, the laundry to be done, or the children to be dressed at home. \nThinking in a concentrated manner to define desired  outcomes is \nsomething few people feel they have to do. But in t ruth, outcome \nthinking is one of the most effective means availab le for making \nwishes reality. \nWhy Things Are on Your Mind \nMost often, the reason something is \"on your mind\" is that you \nwant it to be different than it currently is, and y et: \n• you haven't clarified exactly what the intended out come is; \n• you haven't decided what the very next physical act ion step is; \nand/or \n• you haven't put reminders of the outcome and the ac tion \nrequired in a system you trust. \n15 The ancestor of \nevery action is a \nthought. \n—Ralph \nWaldo \nTHE ART OF GETTING THINGS DONE  I  PART ONE \nThat's why it's on your mind. Until those thoughts have \nbeen clarified and those decisions made,",

As \nPeter Drucker has written, \"In knowledge work ... \nthe task is not given; it has to be determined. 'Wh at \nare the expected results from this work?' is ... th e \nkey question in making knowledge workers produc- \ntive. And it is a question that demands risky deci-\nsions. There is usually no right answer; there are \nchoices instead. And results have to be clearly spe ci- \nfied, if productivity is to be achieved.\" \nMost people have a resistance to initiating the bur st of \nenergy that it will take to clarify the real meanin g, for them, of \nsomething they have let into their world, and to de cide what they \nneed to do about it. We're never really taught that  we have to \nthink about our work before",

    "text": "every action is a \nthought. \n—Ralph \nWaldo \nTHE ART OF GETTING THINGS DONE  I  PART ONE \nThat's why it's on your mind. Until those thoughts have \nbeen clarified and those decisions made, and the re sulting data \nhas been stored in a system that you absolutely know \nyou will think about as often as you need to, your \nbrain can't give up the job. You can fool everyone \nelse, but you can't fool your own mind. It knows \nwhether or not you've come to the conclusions you \nneed to, and whether you've put the resulting out- \ncomes and action reminders in a place that can be \ntrusted to resurface appropriately within your con-\nscious mind. If you haven't done those things, it \nwon't quit working overtime. Even if you've already\ndecided on the next step you'll take to resolve a p rob- \nlem, your mind can't let go until and unless you wr ite yourself \na reminder in a place it knows you will, without fail, look. It \nwill keep pressuring you about that untaken next st ep, usually \nwhen you can't do anything about it, which will jus t add to your \nstress. \n16 Your Mind Doesn't Have a Mind of Its Own \nAt least a portion of your mind is really kind of s tupid, in an interest- \ning way. If it had any innate intelligence, it woul d remind you of the \nthings you needed to do only when you could do something about them. \nDo you have a flashlight somewhere with dead batter ies in \nit? When does your mind tend to remind you that you  need new \nbatteries? When you notice the dead ones! That's no t very smart. \nIf your mind had any innate intelligence, it would remind you \nabout those dead batteries only when you passed liv e ones in a \nstore. And ones of the right size, to boot. \nBetween the time you woke up today and now, did you  think \nof anything you needed to do that you still haven't  done? Have \nyou had that thought more than once? Why? It's a wa ste of time \nand energy to keep thinking about something that yo u make no \nprogress on. And it only adds to your anxieties abo ut what you \nshould be doing and aren't. This constant, \nunproductive \npreoccupation",

You've probably given over a lot of your \n\"stuff,\" a lot of your open loops, to an entity on your \ninner committee that is incapable of dealing with \nthose things effectively the way they are—your mind . \nThe Transformation of \"Stuff\" \nHere's how I define \"stuff\": anything you have allo wed into your \npsychological or physical world that doesn't belong  where it is, but \nfor which you haven't yet determined the desired ou tcome and the \nnext action step. The reason most organizing system s \nhaven't worked for most people is that they haven't\nyet transformed all the \"stuff\" they're trying to o rga- \nnize. As long as it's still \"stuff,\" it's not contr ollable. \nMost of the to-do lists I have seen over the years \n(when people had them at all) were merely listings of \n\"stuff,\" not inventories of the resultant real work  that \nneeded to be done. They were partial reminders of a\nlot of things that were unresolved and as yet untra nslated into out- \ncomes and actions—that is, the real outlines and de tails of what \nthe list-makers had to \"do.\" \n\"Stuff\" is not inherently a bad thing. Things that command \nour attention, by their very nature, usually show u p as \"stuff.\" But \nonce \"stuff\" comes into our lives and work, we have  an inherent \ncommitment to ourselves to define and clarify its m eaning. That's \nour responsibility as knowledge workers; if \"stuff\"  were already \ntransformed and clear, our value, other than physic al labor, would \nprobably not be required. \nAt the conclusion of one of my seminars, a senior m anager of a \nmajor biotech firm looked back at the to-do lists s he had come in \nwith and said, \"Boy, that was an amorphous blob of undoability!\" \nThat's the best description I've ever heard of what  passes for orga- \nnizing lists in most personal systems. The vast maj ority of people \nhave been trying to get organized by rearranging in complete lists of \n17 Rule your mind or \nit will rule you. \n—\nWe need to \ntransform all the \n\"stuff\" we're trying \nto organize into \nactionable stuff we \nneed to do.\n18 THE ART OF GETTING THINGS DONE  I  PART ONE \nunclear things; they haven't yet realized how much and what they \nneed to organize in order to get the real payoff. T hey need to gather \neverything that requires thinking about and then do that thinking if \ntheir organizational efforts are to be successful. \nThe Process: Managing Action \nYou can train yourself, almost like an athlete, to be faster, more \nresponsive, more proactive, and more focused in kno wledge \nwork. You can think more effectively and manage the  results \nwith more ease and control. You can minimize the lo ose ends \nacross the whole spectrum of your work life and per sonal life \nand get a lot more done with less effort. And you c an make front- \nend decision-making about all the \"stuff\" you colle ct and create \nstandard operating procedure for living and working  in this new \nmillennium. \nBefore you can achieve any of that, though, you'll need to get \nin the habit of keeping nothing on your mind. And t he way to do \nthat, as we've seen, is not by managing time, managing in forma- \ntion, or managing priorities. After all: \n• you don't manage five minutes and wind up with six;\n• you don't manage information overload—otherwise you 'd walk \ninto a library and die, or the first time you conne cted to the Web, \nor even opened a phone book, you'd blow up; and \n• you don't manage priorities—you have them. \nInstead, the key to managing all of your \"stuff\" is  managing \nyour actions. \nManaging Action Is the Prime Challenge \nWhat you do with your time, what you do with information, \nand what you do with your body and your focus relative to your \nCHAPTER 1  I  A NEW PRACTICE FOR ANEW REALITY \npriorities—those are the real options to which you must allocate \nyour limited resources. The real issue is how to ma ke appropriate \nchoices about what to do at any point in time. The real issue is \nhow we",

    "text": " with \nall the things we \nhave to do is the \nsingle largest \nconsumer of time \nand energy. \n—Kerry \nCHAPTER 1  [ A NEW PRACTICE FOR A NEW REALITY \nIt seems that most people let their minds run a lot  of the \nshow, especially where the too-much-to-do syndrome is con- \ncerned. You've probably given over a lot of your \n\"stuff,\" a lot of your open loops, to an entity on your \ninner committee that is incapable of dealing with \nthose things effectively the way they are—your mind . \nThe Transformation of \"Stuff\" \nHere's how I define \"stuff\": anything you have allo wed into your \npsychological or physical world that doesn't belong  where it is, but \nfor which you haven't yet determined the desired ou tcome and the \nnext action step. The reason most organizing system s \nhaven't worked for most people is that they haven't\nyet transformed all the \"stuff\" they're trying to o rga- \nnize. As long as it's still \"stuff,\" it's not contr ollable. \nMost of the to-do lists I have seen over the years \n(when people had them at all) were merely listings of \n\"stuff,\" not inventories of the resultant real work  that \nneeded to be done. They were partial reminders of a\nlot of things that were unresolved and as yet untra nslated into out- \ncomes and actions—that is, the real outlines and de tails of what \nthe list-makers had to \"do.\" \n\"Stuff\" is not inherently a bad thing. Things that command \nour attention, by their very nature, usually show u p as \"stuff.\" But \nonce \"stuff\" comes into our lives and work, we have  an inherent \ncommitment to ourselves to define and clarify its m eaning. That's \nour responsibility as knowledge workers; if \"stuff\"  were already \ntransformed and clear, our value, other than physic al labor, would \nprobably not be required. \nAt the conclusion of one of my seminars, a senior m anager of a \nmajor biotech firm looked back at the to-do lists s he had come in \nwith and said, \"Boy, that was an amorphous blob of undoability!\" \nThat's the best description I've ever heard of what  passes for orga- \nnizing lists in most personal systems.",

    "text": "EW REALITY \npriorities—those are the real options to which you must allocate \nyour limited resources. The real issue is how to ma ke appropriate \nchoices about what to do at any point in time. The real issue is \nhow we manage actions. \nThat may sound obvious. However, it might amaze you  to \ndiscover how many next actions for how many project s and com- \nmitments remain undetermined by most people. It's \nextremely difficult to manage actions you haven't \nidentified or decided on. Most people have dozens o f \nthings that they need to do to make progress on \nmany fronts, but they don't yet know what they are.\nAnd the common complaint that \"I don't have time \nto ____\" (fill in the blank) is understandable becau se many pro- \njects seem overwhelming—and are overwhelming because you \ncan't do a project at all! You can only do an action related  to it. \nMany actions require only a minute or two, in the a ppropriate \ncontext, to move a project forward. \nIn training and coaching thousands of professionals , I have \nfound that lack of time is not the major issue for them (though \nthey themselves may think it is); the real problem is a \nlack of clarity and definition about what a project\nreally is, and what the associated next-action step s \nrequired are. Clarifying things on the front end, \nwhen they first appear on the radar, rather than on\nthe back end, after trouble has developed, allows \npeople to reap the benefits of managing action. \nThe Value of a Bottom-Up Approach \nI have discovered over the years the practical valu e of working on \npersonal productivity improvement from the bottom u p, starting \nwith the most mundane, ground-floor level of curren t activity and \ncommitments. Intellectually, the most appropriate w ay ought to be \nto work from the top down, first uncovering persona l and corpo- \nrate missions, then defining critical objectives, a nd finally focus- \ning on the details of implementation. The trouble i s, however, \n19 The beginning \nis half of every \naction. \n—Greek \nThings rarely get \nstuck because of \nlack of time. They get \nstuck because the \ndoing of them has \nnot been defined. \nTHE ART OF GETTING THINGS DONE  |  PART ONE \nthat most people are so embroiled in commitments on  a day-to- \nday level that their ability to focus successfully on the larger hori- \nzon is seriously impaired. Consequently, a bottom-u p approach is \nusually more effective. \nGetting current on and in control of what's in your  in-basket \nand on your mind right now, and incorporating pract ices that can \nhelp you stay that way, will provide the best means of broadening\nyour horizons. A creative, buoyant energy will be u nleashed that \nwill better support your focus on new heights, and your confidence \nwill increase to handle what that creativity produc es. An immedi- \nate sense of freedom, release, and inspiration natu rally comes to \npeople who roll up their sleeves and implement this  process. \nYou'll be better equipped to undertake higher-focus ed \nthinking when your tools for handling the resulting  actions \nfor implementation are part of your ongoing operati onal style. \nThere are more meaningful things to think about tha n your in- \nbasket, but if your management of that level is not  as \nefficient as it could be, it's like trying to swim in \nbaggy clothing. \nMany executives I have worked with during the \nday to clear the decks of their mundane \"stuff\" hav e \nspent the following evening having a stream of idea s \nand visions about their company and their future. \nThis happens as an automatic consequence of \nunsticking their workflow. \nHorizontal and Vertical Action Management \nYou need to control commitments, projects, and acti ons in two \nways—horizontally and vertically. \"Horizontal\" cont rol \nmaintains \ncoherence across all the activities in which you ar e involved. \nImagine your psyche constantly scanning your enviro nment like \npolice radar; it may land on any of a thousand diff erent items that \ninvite or demand your attention during any twenty-f our-hour \nperiod: the drugstore, the housekeeper, your aunt M artha, the \nstrategic plan, lunch, a wilting plant in the offic e, an upset cus- \n20 Vision is not \nenough; it must be \ncombined with \nventure. It is not \nenough to stare up \nthe steps; we must \nstep up the stairs. \n—Vaclav Havel \nCHAPTER 1 | A NEW PRACTICE FOR A NEW REALITY \ntomer, shoes that need shining. You have to buy sta mps",

The real issue is how to ma ke appropriate \nchoices about what to do at any point in time. The real issue is \nhow we manage actions. \nThat may sound obvious. However, it might amaze you  to \ndiscover how many next actions for how many project s and com- \nmitments remain undetermined by most people. It's \nextremely difficult to manage actions you haven't \nidentified or decided on. Most people have dozens o f \nthings that they need to do to make progress on \nmany fronts, but they don't yet know what they are.\nAnd the common complaint that \"I don't have time \nto ____\" (fill in the blank) is understandable becau se many pro- \njects seem overwhelming—and are overwhelming because you \ncan't do a project at all! You can only do an action related  to it. \nMany actions require only a minute or two, in the a ppropriate \ncontext, to move a project forward. \nIn training and coaching thousands of professionals , I have \nfound that lack of time is not the major issue for them (though \nthey themselves may think it is); the real problem is a \nlack of clarity and definition about what a project\nreally is, and what the associated next-action step s \nrequired are. Clarifying things on the front end, \nwhen they first appear on the radar, rather than on\nthe back end, after trouble has developed, allows \npeople to reap the benefits of managing action. \nThe Value of a Bottom-Up Approach \nI have discovered over the years the practical valu e of working on \npersonal productivity improvement from the bottom u p, starting \nwith the most mundane, ground-floor level of curren t activity and \ncommitments.

Consequently, a bottom-u p approach is \nusually more effective. \nGetting current on and in control of what's in your  in-basket \nand on your mind right now, and incorporating pract ices that can \nhelp you stay that way, will provide the best means of broadening\nyour horizons. A creative, buoyant energy will be u nleashed that \nwill better support your focus on new heights, and your confidence \nwill increase to handle what that creativity produc es. An immedi- \nate sense of freedom, release, and inspiration natu rally comes to \npeople who roll up their sleeves and implement this  process. \nYou'll be better equipped to undertake higher-focus ed \nthinking when your tools for handling the resulting  actions \nfor implementation are part of your ongoing operati onal style. \nThere are more meaningful things to think about tha n your in- \nbasket, but if your management of that level is not  as \nefficient as it could be, it's like trying to swim in \nbaggy clothing. \nMany executives I have worked with during the \nday to clear the decks of their mundane \"stuff\" hav e \nspent the following evening having a stream of idea s \nand visions about their company and their future. \nThis happens as an automatic consequence of \nunsticking their workflow. \nHorizontal and Vertical Action Management \nYou need to control commitments, projects, and acti ons in two \nways—horizontally and vertically. \"Horizontal\" cont rol \nmaintains \ncoherence across all the activities in which you ar e involved. \nImagine your psyche constantly scanning your enviro nment like \npolice radar; it may land on any of a thousand diff erent items that \ninvite or demand your attention during any twenty-f our-hour \nperiod: the drugstore, the housekeeper, your aunt M artha, the \nstrategic plan, lunch, a wilting plant in the offic e, an upset cus- \n20 Vision is not \nenough; it must be \ncombined with \nventure.

Consequently, a bottom-u p approach is \nusually more effective. \nGetting current on and in control of what's in your  in-basket \nand on your mind right now, and incorporating pract ices that can \nhelp you stay that way, will provide the best means of broadening\nyour horizons. A creative, buoyant energy will be u nleashed that \nwill better support your focus on new heights, and your confidence \nwill increase to handle what that creativity produc es. An immedi- \nate sense of freedom, release, and inspiration natu rally comes to \npeople who roll up their sleeves and implement this  process. \nYou'll be better equipped to undertake higher-focus ed \nthinking when your tools for handling the resulting  actions \nfor implementation are part of your ongoing operati onal style. \nThere are more meaningful things to think",

    "text": " \nthe steps; we must \nstep up the stairs. \n—Vaclav Havel \nCHAPTER 1 | A NEW PRACTICE FOR A NEW REALITY \ntomer, shoes that need shining. You have to buy sta mps, deposit \nthat check, make the hotel reservation, cancel a st aff meeting, see \na movie tonight. You might be surprised at the volu me of things \nyou actually think about and have to deal with just  in one day. You \nneed a good system that can keep track of as many o f them as pos- \nsible, supply required information about them on de mand, and \nallow you to shift your focus from one thing to the  next quickly \nand easily. \n\"Vertical\" control, in contrast, manages thinking u p and \ndown the track of individual topics and projects. F or example, \nyour inner \"police radar\" lands on your next vacati on as you and \nyour spouse talk about it over dinner—where and whe n you'll go, \nwhat you'll do, how to prepare for the trip, and so  on. Or you and \nyour boss need to make some decisions about the new  depart- \nmental reorganization you're about to launch. Or yo u just need to \nget your thinking up to date on the customer you're  about to call. \nThis is \"project planning\" in the broad sense. It's  focusing in on a \nsingle endeavor, situation, or person and fleshing out whatever \nideas, details, priorities, and sequences of events  may be required \nfor you to handle it, at least for the moment. \nThe goal for managing horizontally and vertically i s the \nsame: to get things off your mind and get things do ne. Appropri- \nate action management lets you feel comfortable and  in control as \nyou move through your broad spectrum of work and li fe, while \nappropriate project focusing gets you clear about a nd on track \nwith the specifics needed. \nThe Major Change: Getting It All Out of Your Head \nThere is no real way to achieve the kind of relaxed\ncontrol I'm promising if you keep things only in yo ur \nhead. As you'll discover, the individual behaviors \ndescribed in this book are things you're already \ndoing. The big difference between what I do and \nwhat others do is that I capture and organize 100 \npercent of my \"stuff\" in and with objective tools at There is usually an \ninverse proportion \nbetween how much \nsomething is on \nyour mind and how \nmuch it's getting \ndone.\n21 \nTHE ART OF GETTING THINGS DONE  |  PART ONE \nhand, not in my mind. And that applies to everything —little or big, \npersonal or professional, urgent or not. Everything . \nI'm sure that at some time or other you've gotten t o a place in \na project, or in your life, where you just had to sit down and make a \nlist. If so, you have a reference point for what I'm talk ing about. \nMost people, however, do that kind of list-making d rill only when \nthe confusion gets too unbearable and they just have to do some- \nthing about it. They usually make a list only about  the specific \narea that's bugging them. But if you made that kind  of review a \ncharacteristic of your ongoing life- and work style , and you main- \ntained it across all areas of your life (not just t he most \"urgent\"), \nyou'd be practicing the kind of \"black belt\" manage ment style I'm \ndescribing. \nI try to make intuitive choices based on my \noptions, instead of trying to think about what thos e \noptions are. I need to have thought about all of that \nalready and captured the results in a trusted way. I \ndon't want to waste time thinking about things more\nthan once. That's an inefficient use of creative en ergy \nand a source of frustration and stress. \nAnd you can't fudge this thinking. Your mind will k eep \nworking on anything that's still in that undecided state. But \nthere's a limit to how much unresolved \"stuff\" it c an contain \nbefore it blows a fuse. \nThe short-term-memory part of your mind—the part th at \ntends to hold all of the incomplete, undecided, and  unorganized \n\"stuff\"—functions much like RAM on a personal compu ter. Your \nconscious mind, like the computer screen, is a focu sing tool, not a \nstorage place. You can think about only two or thre e things at once. \nBut the incomplete items are still being stored in the short-term- \nmemory space. And as with RAM, there's limited capa city; there's \nonly so much \"stuff\" you can store in there and sti ll have that",

You have to buy sta mps, deposit \nthat check, make the hotel reservation, cancel a st aff meeting, see \na movie tonight. You might be surprised at the volu me of things \nyou actually think about and have to deal with just  in one day. You \nneed a good system that can keep track of as many o f them as pos- \nsible, supply required information about them on de mand, and \nallow you to shift your focus from one thing to the  next quickly \nand easily. \n\"Vertical\" control, in contrast, manages thinking u p and \ndown the track of individual topics and projects. F or example, \nyour inner \"police radar\" lands on your next vacati on as you and \nyour spouse talk about it over dinner—where and whe n you'll go, \nwhat you'll do, how to prepare for the trip, and so  on. Or you and \nyour boss need to make some decisions about the new  depart- \nmental reorganization you're about to launch. Or yo u just need to \nget your thinking up to date on the customer you're  about to call. \nThis is \"project planning\" in the broad sense. It's  focusing in on a \nsingle endeavor, situation, or person and fleshing out whatever \nideas, details, priorities, and sequences of events  may be required \nfor you to handle it, at least for the moment. \nThe goal for managing horizontally and vertically i s the \nsame: to get things off your mind and get things do ne. Appropri- \nate action management lets you feel comfortable and  in control as \nyou move through your broad spectrum of work and li fe, while \nappropriate project focusing gets you clear about a nd on track \nwith the specifics needed. \nThe Major Change: Getting It All Out of Your Head \nThere is no real way to achieve the kind of relaxed\ncontrol I'm promising if you keep things only in yo ur \nhead. As you'll discover, the individual behaviors \ndescribed in this book are things you're already \ndoing. The big difference between what I do and \nwhat others do is that I capture and organize 100 \npercent of my \"stuff\" in and with objective tools at There",

    "text": " individual behaviors \ndescribed in this book are things you're already \ndoing. The big difference between what I do and \nwhat others do is that I capture and organize 100 \npercent of my \"stuff\" in and with objective tools at There is usually an \ninverse proportion \nbetween how much \nsomething is on \nyour mind and how \nmuch it's getting \ndone.\n21 \nTHE ART OF GETTING THINGS DONE  |  PART ONE \nhand, not in my mind. And that applies to everything —little or big, \npersonal or professional, urgent or not. Everything . \nI'm sure that at some time or other you've gotten t o a place in \na project, or in your life, where you just had to sit down and make a \nlist. If so, you have a reference point for what I'm talk ing about. \nMost people, however, do that kind of list-making d rill only when \nthe confusion gets too unbearable and they just have to do some- \nthing about it. They usually make a list only about  the specific \narea that's bugging them. But if you made that kind  of review a \ncharacteristic of your ongoing life- and work style , and you main- \ntained it across all areas of your life (not just t he most \"urgent\"), \nyou'd be practicing the kind of \"black belt\" manage ment style I'm \ndescribing. \nI try to make intuitive choices based on my \noptions, instead of trying to think about what thos e \noptions are. I need to have thought about all of that \nalready and captured the results in a trusted way. I \ndon't want to waste time thinking about things more\nthan once. That's an inefficient use of creative en ergy \nand a source of frustration and stress. \nAnd you can't fudge this thinking. Your mind will k eep \nworking on anything that's still in that undecided state. But \nthere's a limit to how much unresolved \"stuff\" it c an contain \nbefore it blows a fuse. \nThe short-term-memory part of your mind—the part th at \ntends to hold all of the incomplete, undecided, and  unorganized \n\"stuff\"—functions much like RAM on a personal compu ter. Your \nconscious mind, like the computer screen, is a focu sing tool, not a \nstorage place. You can think about only two or thre e things at once.",

And as with RAM, there's limited capa city; there's \nonly so much \"stuff\" you can store in there and sti ll have that part of \nyour brain function at a high level. Most people wa lk around with \ntheir RAM bursting at the seams. They're constantly  distracted, \ntheir focus disturbed by their own internal mental overload. \n22 There is no reason \never to have the \nsame thought twice, \nunless you like \nhaving that thought. \nCHAPTER 1   I  A NEW PRACTICE FOR ANEW REALITY \nFor example, in the last few minutes, has your mind  wan- \ndered off into some area that doesn't have anything  to do with \nwhat you're reading here? Probably. And most likely  where your \nmind went was to some open loop, some incomplete si tuation \nthat you have some investment in. All that situatio n did was rear \nup out of the RAM part of your brain and yell at yo u, internally. \nAnd what did you do about it? Unless you wrote it d own and put \nit in a trusted \"bucket\" that you know you'll revie w appropriately \nsometime soon, more than likely you worried about it. Not the \nmost effective behavior: no progress was made, and \ntension was increased. \nThe big problem is that your mind keeps \nreminding you of things when you can't do anything \nabout them. It has no sense of past or future. That\nmeans that as soon as you tell yourself that you ne ed \nto do something, and store it in your RAM, there's a \npart of you that thinks you should be doing that so mething all the \ntime. Everything you've told yourself you ought to do, it  thinks \nyou should be doing right now. Frankly, as soon as you have two \nthings to do stored in your RAM, you've generated p ersonal \nfailure, because you can't do them both at the same  time. This \nproduces an all-pervasive stress factor whose sourc e can't be pin- \npointed. \nMost people have been in some version of this menta l stress \nstate so consistently, for so long, that they don't  even know they're \nin it. Like gravity, it's ever-present—so much so that  those who \nexperience it usually aren't even aware of the pres sure. The only \ntime most of them will realize how much tension the y've been \nunder is when they get rid of it and notice how dif ferent they feel. \nCan you get rid of that kind of stress? You bet. Th e rest of \nthis book will explain how. \n23 It  is hard to fight \nan enemy who has \noutposts in your \nhead. \n—Sally Kempton",

And as with RAM, there's limited capa city; there's \nonly so much \"stuff\" you can store in there and sti ll have that part of \nyour brain function at a high level. Most people wa lk around with \ntheir RAM bursting at the seams. They're constantly  distracted, \ntheir focus disturbed by their own internal mental overload. \n22 There is no reason \never to have the \nsame thought twice, \nunless you like \nhaving that thought. \nCHAPTER 1   I  A NEW PRACTICE FOR ANEW REALITY \nFor example, in the last few minutes, has your mind  wan- \ndered off into some area that doesn't have anything  to do with \nwhat you're reading here? Probably. And most likely  where your \nmind went was to some open loop, some incomplete si tuation \nthat you have some investment in. All that situatio n did was rear \nup out of the RAM part of your brain and yell at yo u, internally. \nAnd what did you do about it? Unless you wrote it d own and put \nit in a trusted \"bucket\" that you know you'll revie w appropriately \nsometime soon, more than likely you worried about it. Not the \nmost effective behavior: no progress was made, and \ntension was increased. \nThe big problem is that your mind keeps \nreminding you of things when you can't do anything \nabout them. It has no sense of past or future. That\nmeans that as soon as you tell yourself that you ne ed \nto do something, and store it in your RAM, there's a \npart of you that thinks you should be doing that so mething all the \ntime. Everything you've told yourself you ought to do, it  thinks \nyou should be doing right now. Frankly, as soon as you have two \nthings to do stored in your RAM, you've generated p ersonal \nfailure, because you can't do them both at the same  time. This \nproduces an all-pervasive stress factor whose sourc e can't be pin- \npointed. \nMost people have been in some version of this menta l stress \nstate so consistently, for so long, that they don't  even know they're \nin it. Like gravity, it's ever-present—so much so that ",

Not the \nmost effective behavior: no progress was made, and \ntension was increased. \nThe big problem is that your mind keeps \nreminding you of things when you can't do anything \nabout them. It has no sense of past or future. That\nmeans that as soon as you tell yourself that you ne ed \nto do something, and store it in your RAM, there's a \npart of you that thinks you should be doing that so mething all the \ntime. Everything you've told yourself you ought to do, it  thinks \nyou should be doing right now. Frankly, as soon as you have two \nthings to do stored in your RAM, you've generated p ersonal \nfailure, because you can't do them both at the same  time.

Like gravity, it's ever-present—so much so that  those who \nexperience it usually aren't even aware of the pres sure. The only \ntime most of them will realize how much tension the y've been \nunder is when they get rid of it and notice how dif ferent they feel. \nCan you get rid of that kind of stress? You bet.

The only \ntime most of them will realize how much tension the y've been \nunder is when they get rid of it and notice how dif ferent they feel. \nCan you get rid of that kind of stress? You bet.
