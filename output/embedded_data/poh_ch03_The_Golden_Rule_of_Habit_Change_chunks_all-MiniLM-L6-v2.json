The Bucca-\nneers are playing in San Diego against the Chargers, a team that appeared in the Super Bowl the previous year. The Bucs are losing, 17 to 16. They’ve been losing all game. They’ve been losing all sea-son. They’ve been losing all decade. The Buccaneers have not won a game on the West Coast in sixteen years, and many of the team ’s current players were in grade school the last time the Bucs had a victorious season. So far this year, their record is 2–8. In one of those games, the Detroit  Lions— a team so bad it would later be described as putting the “less” in “hopeless”—beat the Bucs 21 to 6, and then, three weeks later, beat them again, 27 to 0. One newspaper colum-\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   60 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   60 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Golden Rule of Habit Change ● 61\nnist has started referring to the Bucs as “ America’s Orange Door-\nmat.” ESPN is predicting that Dungy, who got his job only in January, could be ﬁ  red before the year is done.\nOn the sidelines, however, as Dungy watches his team arrange \nitself for the next play, it feels like the sun has ﬁ  nally broken through \nthe clouds. He doesn ’t smile. He never lets his emotions show dur-ing a game. But something is taking place on the ﬁ  eld, something \nhe’s been working toward for years. As the jeers from the hostile crowd of ﬁ  fty thousand rain down upon him, Tony Dungy sees \nsomething that no one else does. He sees proof that his plan is start-ing to work.\n● ● ●\nTony Dungy had waited an eternity for this job. For seventeen years, he prowled the sidelines as an assistant coach, ﬁ  rst at the University \nof Minnesota, then with the Pittsburgh Steelers, then the Kansas City Chiefs, and then back to Minnesota with the Vikings. Four times in the past decade, he had been invited to interview for head coaching positions with NFL teams.\nAll four times, the interviews hadn ’t gone well.Part of the problem was Dungy’s coaching philosophy. In his job \ninterviews, he would patiently explain his belief that the key to win-ning was changing players’ habits. He wanted to get players to stop making so many decisions during a game, he said. He wanted them to react automatically, habitually. If he could instill the right habits, his team would win. Period.\n“Champions don ’t do extraordinary things,” Dungy would ex-\nplain. “They do ordinary things, but they do them without thinking, too fast for the other team to react. They follow the habits they’ve learned.”\nHow, the owners would ask, are you going to create those new \nhabits?\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   61 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   61 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n62 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nOh, no, he wasn ’t going to create new habits, Dungy would an-\nswer. Players spent their lives building the habits that got them to the NFL. No athlete is going to abandon those patterns simply be-cause some new coach says to.\nSo rather than creating new habits, Dungy was going to change \nplayers’ old ones. And the secret to changing old habits was using what was already inside players’ heads. Habits are a  three- step  loop— the cue, the routine, and the  reward— and Dungy only wanted to attack the middle step, the routine. He knew from experience that it was easier to convince someone to adopt a new behavior if there was something familiar at the beginning and end.\nHis coaching strategy embodied an axiom, a Golden Rule of \nhabit change that study after study has shown is among the most",

The Bucca-\nneers are playing in San Diego against the Chargers, a team that appeared in the Super Bowl the previous year. The Bucs are losing, 17 to 16. They’ve been losing all game. They’ve been losing all sea-son. They’ve been losing all decade. The Buccaneers have not won a game on the West Coast in sixteen years, and many of the team ’s current players were in grade school the last time the Bucs had a victorious season. So far this year, their record is 2–8. In one of those games, the Detroit  Lions— a team so bad it would later be described as putting the “less” in “hopeless”—beat the Bucs 21 to 6, and then, three weeks later, beat them again, 27 to 0.

He doesn ’t smile. He never lets his emotions show dur-ing a game. But something is taking place on the ﬁ  eld, something \nhe’s been working toward for years. As the jeers from the hostile crowd of ﬁ  fty thousand rain down upon him, Tony Dungy sees \nsomething that no",

As the jeers from the hostile crowd of ﬁ  fty thousand rain down upon him, Tony Dungy sees \nsomething that no one else does. He sees proof that his plan is start-ing to work.\n● ● ●\nTony Dungy had waited an eternity for this job. For seventeen years, he prowled the sidelines as an assistant coach, ﬁ  rst at the University \nof Minnesota, then with the Pittsburgh Steelers, then the Kansas City Chiefs, and then back to Minnesota with the Vikings. Four times in the past decade, he had been invited to interview for head coaching positions with NFL teams.\nAll four times, the interviews hadn ’t gone well.Part of the problem was Dungy’s coaching philosophy. In his job \ninterviews, he would patiently explain his belief that the key to win-ning was changing players’ habits. He wanted to get players to stop making so many decisions during a game, he said. He wanted them to react automatically, habitually. If he could instill the right habits, his team would win. Period.\n“Champions don ’t do extraordinary things,” Dungy would ex-\nplain. “They do ordinary things, but they do them without thinking, too fast for the other team to react. They follow the habits they’ve learned.”\nHow, the owners would ask, are you going to create those new \nhabits?\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   61 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   61 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n62 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nOh, no, he wasn ’t going to create new habits, Dungy would an-\nswer. Players spent their lives building the habits that got them to the NFL. No athlete is going to abandon those patterns simply be-cause some new coach says to.\nSo rather than creating new habits, Dungy was going to change \nplayers’ old ones. And the secret to changing old habits was using what was already inside players’ heads. Habits are a  three- step  loop— the cue, the routine, and the  reward— and Dungy only wanted to attack the middle step, the routine. He",

As the jeers from the hostile crowd of ﬁ  fty thousand rain down upon him, Tony Dungy sees \nsomething that no one else does. He sees proof that his plan is start-ing to work.\n● ● ●\nTony Dungy had waited an eternity for this job. For seventeen years, he prowled the sidelines as an assistant coach, ﬁ  rst at the University \nof Minnesota, then with the Pittsburgh Steelers, then the Kansas City Chiefs, and then back to Minnesota with the Vikings. Four times in the past decade, he had been invited to interview for head coaching positions with NFL teams.\nAll four times, the interviews hadn ’t gone well.Part of the problem was Dungy’s coaching philosophy. In his job \ninterviews, he would patiently explain his belief that the key to win-ning was changing players’ habits. He wanted to get players to stop making so many decisions during a game, he said. He wanted them to react automatically, habitually. If he could instill the right habits, his team would win. Period.\n“Champions don ’t do extraordinary things,” Dungy",

    "text": " knew from experience that it was easier to convince someone to adopt a new behavior if there was something familiar at the beginning and end.\nHis coaching strategy embodied an axiom, a Golden Rule of \nhabit change that study after study has shown is among the most powerful tools for creating change. Dungy recognized that you can never truly extinguish bad habits.\nRather, to change a habit, you must keep the old cue, and deliver \nthe old reward, but insert a new routine.\nThat’s the rule: If you use the same cue, and provide the same \nreward, you can shift the routine and change the habit. Almost any behavior can be transformed if the cue and reward stay the same.\nThe Golden Rule has inﬂ  uenced treatments for alcoholism, obe-\nsity,  obsessive- compulsive disorders, and hundreds of other destruc-tive behaviors, and understanding it can help anyone change their own habits. (Attempts to give up snacking, for instance, will often fail unless there’s a new routine to satisfy old cues and reward urges. A smoker usually can ’t quit unless she ﬁ  nds some activity to replace \ncigarettes when her nicotine craving is triggered.)\nFour times Dungy explained his  habit- based philosophy to team \nowners. Four times they listened politely, thanked him for his time, and then hired someone else.\nThen, in 1996, the woeful Buccaneers called. Dungy ﬂ  ew to \nTampa Bay and, once again, laid out his plan for how they could win. The day after the ﬁ  nal interview, they offered him the job.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   62 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   62 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Golden Rule of Habit Change ● 63\nDungy’s system would eventually turn the Bucs into one of the \nleague’s winningest teams. He would become the only coach in NFL history to reach the  play- offs in ten consecutive years, the ﬁ  rst Afri-\ncan American coach to win a Super Bowl, and one of the most re-spected ﬁ  gures in professional athletics. His coaching techniques \nwould spread throughout the league and all of sports. His approach would help illuminate how to remake the habits in anyone’s life.\nBut all of that would come later. Today, in San Diego, Dungy just \nwanted to win.\n● ● ●\nFrom the sidelines, Dungy looks up at the clock: 8:19 remaining. The Bucs have been behind all game and have squandered opportu-nity after opportunity, in typical fashion. If their defense doesn ’t make something happen right now, this game will effectively be over. San Diego has the ball on their own  twenty- yard line, and the HOW IT WORKS:\nUSE THE SAME CUE. \nPROVIDE THE SAME REWARD.\nCHA NG E THE R OU TINE.THE GOLDEN RULE OF HABIT CHANGE\nYou Can’t Extinguish a Bad Habit, \nYou Can Only Change It.\nHUT! HUT!Routine Routine\nReward CueCRAVING \nFOR VICTORY\nReward CueCRAVING \nFOR VICTORY\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   63 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   63 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n64 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nChargers’ quarterback, Stan Humphries, is preparing to lead a drive \nthat, he hopes, will put the game away. The play clock begins, and Humphries is poised to take the snap.\nBut Dungy isn ’t looking at Humphries. Instead, he’s watching \nhis own players align into a formation they have spent months per-fecting. Traditionally, football is a game of feints and counterfeints, trick plays and misdirection. Coaches with the thickest playbooks and most complicated schemes usually win. Dungy, however, has taken the opposite approach. He isn ’t interested in complication or obfuscation. When Dungy’s defensive players line up, it is obvious to everyone exactly which play they are going to use.\nDungy has opted for this approach because, in theory, he doesn ’t \nneed misdirection. He simply needs his team to be faster than ev-eryone else. In football, milliseconds matter. So instead of teaching his players hundreds of formations, he has taught them only a hand-ful, but they have practiced over and over until the behaviors are",

Dungy recognized that you can never truly extinguish bad habits.\nRather, to change a habit, you must keep the old cue, and deliver \nthe old reward, but insert a new routine.\nThat’s the rule: If you use the same cue, and provide the same \nreward, you can shift the routine and change the habit. Almost any behavior can be transformed if the cue and reward stay the same.\nThe Golden Rule has inﬂ  uenced treatments for alcoholism, obe-\nsity,  obsessive- compulsive disorders, and hundreds of other destruc-tive behaviors, and understanding it can help anyone change their own habits. (Attempts to give up snacking, for instance, will often fail unless there’s a new routine to satisfy old cues and reward urges. A smoker usually can ’t quit unless she ﬁ  nds some activity to replace \ncigarettes when her nicotine craving is triggered.)\nFour times Dungy explained his  habit- based philosophy to team \nowners. Four times they listened politely, thanked him for his time, and then hired someone else.\nThen, in 1996, the woeful Buccaneers called. Dungy ﬂ  ew to \nTampa Bay and, once again, laid out his plan for how they could win. The day after the ﬁ  nal interview, they offered him the job.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   62 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   62 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Golden Rule of Habit Change ● 63\nDungy’s system would eventually turn the Bucs into one of the \nleague’s winningest teams. He would become the only coach in NFL history to reach the  play- offs in ten consecutive years, the ﬁ  rst Afri-\ncan American coach to win a Super Bowl, and one of the most re-spected ﬁ  gures in professional athletics. His coaching techniques \nwould spread throughout the league and all of sports. His approach would help illuminate how",

Almost any behavior can be transformed if the cue and reward stay the same.\nThe Golden Rule has inﬂ  uenced treatments for alcoholism, obe-\nsity,  obsessive- compulsive disorders, and hundreds of other destruc-tive behaviors, and understanding it can help anyone change their own habits. (Attempts to give up snacking, for instance, will often fail unless there’s a new routine to satisfy old cues and reward urges.

His coaching techniques \nwould spread throughout the league and all of sports. His approach would help illuminate how to remake the habits in anyone’s life.\nBut all of that would come later. Today, in San Diego, Dungy just \nwanted to win.\n● ● ●\nFrom the sidelines, Dungy looks up at the clock: 8:19 remaining. The Bucs have been behind all game and have squandered opportu-nity after opportunity, in typical fashion. If their defense doesn ’t make something happen right now, this game will effectively be over.

The play clock begins, and Humphries is poised to take the snap.\nBut Dungy isn ’t looking at Humphries. Instead, he’s watching \nhis own players align into a formation they have spent months per-fecting. Traditionally, football is a game of feints and counterfeints, trick plays and misdirection. Coaches with the thickest playbooks and most complicated schemes usually win. Dungy, however, has taken the opposite approach. He isn ’t interested in complication or obfuscation. When Dungy’s defensive players line up, it is obvious to everyone exactly which play they are going to use.\nDungy has opted for this approach because, in theory, he doesn ’t \nneed misdirection.

So instead of teaching his players hundreds of formations, he has taught them only a hand-ful, but they have practiced over and over until the behaviors are automatic. When his strategy works, his players can move with a speed that is impossible to overcome.\nBut only when it works. If his players think too much or hesitate \nor  second- guess their instincts, the system falls apart. And so far, Dungy’s players have been a mess.\nThis time, however, as the Bucs line up on the  twenty- yard line, \nsomething is different. Take Regan Upshaw, a Buccaneer defensive end who has settled into a  three- point stance on the scrimmage line. Instead of looking up and down the line, trying to absorb as much information as possible, Upshaw is looking only at the cues that Dungy taught him to focus on. First, he glances at the outside foot of the opposite lineman (his toes are back, which means he is preparing to block while the quarterback passes); next, Upshaw looks at the lineman ’s shoulders (rotated slightly inward), and the space between him and the next player (a fraction narrower than expected).\nUpshaw has practiced how to react to each of these cues so many \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   64 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   64 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Golden Rule of Habit Change ● 65\ntimes that, at this point, he doesn ’t have to think about what to do. \nHe just follows his habits.\nSan Diego’s quarterback approaches the line of scrimmage and \nglances right, then left, barks the count and takes the ball. He drops back ﬁ  ve steps and stands tall, swiveling his head, looking for an \nopen receiver. Three seconds have passed since the play started. The stadium ’s eyes and the television cameras are on him.\nSo most observers fail to see what’s happening among the Buc-\ncaneers. As soon as Humphries took the snap, Upshaw sprang into action. Within the ﬁ  rst second of the play, he darted right, across the \nline of scrimmage, so fast the offensive lineman couldn ’t block him. Within the next second, Upshaw ran four more paces downﬁ  eld, his \nsteps a blur. In the next second, Upshaw moved three strides closer to the quarterback, his path impossible for the offensive lineman to predict.\nAs the play moves into its fourth second, Humphries, the San \nDiego quarterback, is suddenly exposed. He hesitates, sees Upshaw from the corner of his eye. And that’s when Humphries makes his mistake. He starts thinking .\nHumphries spots a teammate, a rookie tight end named Brian \nRoche, twenty yards downﬁ  eld. There’s another San Diego receiver \nmuch closer, waving his arms, calling for the ball. The short pass is the safe choice. Instead, Humphries, under pressure, performs a  split- second analysis, cocks his arm, and heaves to Roche.\nThat hurried decision is precisely what Dungy was hoping for. \nAs soon as the ball is in the air, a Buccaneer safety named John Lynch starts moving. Lynch ’s job was straightforward: When the play started, he ran to a particular point on the ﬁ  eld and waited for \nhis cue. There’s enormous pressure to improvise in this situation. But Dungy has drilled Lynch until his routine is automatic. And as a result, when the ball leaves the quarterback’s hands, Lynch is standing ten yards from Roche, waiting.\nAs the ball spins through the air, Lynch reads his  cues— the di-\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   65 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   65 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n66 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nrection of the quarterback’s face mask and hands, the spacing of the \n receivers— and starts moving before it’s clear where the ball will land. Roche, the San Diego receiver, springs forward, but Lynch cuts around him and intercepts the pass. Before Roche can react, Lynch takes off down the ﬁ  eld toward the Chargers’ end zone. The other \nBuccaneers are perfectly positioned to clear his route. Lynch runs 10, then 15, then 20, then almost 25 yards before he is ﬁ  nally pushed",

So instead of teaching his players hundreds of formations, he has taught them only a hand-ful, but they have practiced over and over until the behaviors are automatic. When his strategy works, his players can move with a speed that is impossible to overcome.\nBut only when it works. If his players think too much or hesitate \nor  second- guess their instincts, the system falls apart. And so far, Dungy’s players have been a mess.\nThis time, however, as the Bucs line up on the  twenty- yard line, \nsomething is different. Take Regan Upshaw, a Buccaneer defensive end who has settled into a  three- point stance on the scrimmage line. Instead of looking up and down the line, trying to absorb as much information as possible, Upshaw is looking only at the cues that Dungy taught him to focus on. First, he glances at the outside foot of the opposite lineman (his toes are back, which means he is preparing to block while the quarterback passes); next, Upshaw looks at the lineman ’s shoulders (rotated slightly inward), and the space between him and the next player (a fraction narrower than expected).\nUpshaw has practiced how to react to each of these cues so many \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   64 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   64 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Golden Rule of Habit Change ● 65\ntimes that, at this point, he doesn ’t have to think about what to do. \nHe just follows his habits.\nSan Diego’s quarterback approaches the line of scrimmage and \nglances right, then left, barks the count and takes the ball. He drops back ﬁ  ve steps and stands tall, swiveling his head, looking for an \nopen receiver. Three seconds have passed since the play started. The stadium ’s eyes and the television cameras are on him.\nSo most observers fail to see what’s happening among the Buc-\ncaneers. As soon as Humphries took the snap, Upshaw sprang into action.

Lynch ’s job was straightforward: When the play started, he ran to a particular point on the ﬁ  eld and waited for \nhis cue. There’s enormous pressure to improvise in this situation. But Dungy has drilled Lynch until his routine is automatic. And as a result, when the ball leaves the quarterback’s hands, Lynch is standing ten yards from Roche, waiting.\nAs the ball spins through the air, Lynch reads his  cues— the di-\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   65 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   65 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n66 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nrection of the quarterback’s face mask and hands, the spacing of the \n receivers— and starts moving before it’s clear where the ball will land.

Lynch runs 10, then 15, then 20, then almost 25 yards before he is ﬁ  nally pushed \nout of bounds. The entire play has taken less than ten seconds.\nTwo minutes later, the Bucs score a touchdown, taking the lead \nfor the ﬁ  rst time all game. Five minutes later, they kick a ﬁ  eld goal. \nIn between, Dungy’s defense shuts down each of San Diego’s come-back attempts. The Buccaneers win, 25 to 17, one of the biggest upsets of the season.\nAt the end of the game, Lynch and Dungy exit the ﬁ  eld together.\n“It feels like something was different out there,” Lynch says as \nthey walk into the tunnel.\n“We’re starting to believe,” Dungy replies.\nII.\nTo understand how a coach ’s focus on changing habits could re-make a team, it’s necessary to look outside the world of sports. Way outside, to a dingy basement on the Lower East Side of New York City in 1934, where one of the largest and most successful attempts at  wide- scale habit change was born.\nSitting in the basement was a  thirty- nine- year- old alcoholic \nnamed Bill Wilson. Years earlier, Wilson had taken his ﬁ  rst drink \nduring ofﬁ  cers’ training camp in New Bedford, Massachusetts, \nwhere he was learning to ﬁ  re machine guns before getting shipped \nto France and World War I. Prominent families who lived near the base often invited ofﬁ  cers to dinner, and one Sunday night, Wilson \nattended a party where he was served rarebit and beer. He was  twenty- two years old and had never had alcohol before. The only \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   66 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   66 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Golden Rule of Habit Change ● 67\npolite thing, it seemed, was to drink the glass served to him. A few \nweeks later, Wilson was invited to another elegant affair. Men were in tuxedos, women were ﬂ  irting. A butler came by and put a Bronx \n cocktail— a combination of gin, dry and sweet vermouth, and or-ange  juice— into Wilson ’s hand. He took a sip and felt, he later said, as if he had found “the elixir of life.”\nBy the mid-1930s, back from Europe, his marriage falling apart \nand a fortune from selling stocks vaporized, Wilson was consuming three bottles of booze a day. On a cold November afternoon, while he was sitting in the gloom, an old drinking buddy called. Wilson invited him over and mixed a pitcher of pineapple juice and gin. He poured his friend a glass.\nHis friend handed it back. He’d been sober for two months, he \nsaid.\nWilson was astonished. He started describing his own struggles \nwith alcohol, including the ﬁ  ght he’d gotten into at a country club \nthat had cost him his job. He had tried to quit, he said, but couldn ’t manage it. He’d been to detox and had taken pills. He’d made prom-ises to his wife and joined abstinence groups. None of it worked. How, Wilson asked, had his friend done it?\n“I got religion,” the friend said. He talked about hell and tempta-\ntion, sin and the devil. “Realize you are licked, admit it, and get will-ing to turn your life over to God.”\nWilson thought the guy was nuts. “Last summer an alcoholic \ncrackpot; now, I suspected, a little cracked about religion,” he later wrote. When his friend left, Wilson polished off the booze and went to bed.\nA month later, in December 1934, Wilson checked into the \nCharles B. Towns Hospital for Drug and Alcohol Addictions, an up-scale Manhattan detox center. A physician started hourly infusions of a hallucinogenic drug called belladonna, then in vogue for the treatment of alcoholism. Wilson ﬂ  oated in and out of consciousness \non a bed in a small room.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   67 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   67 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n68 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nThen, in an episode that has",

Lynch runs 10, then 15, then 20, then almost 25 yards before he is ﬁ  nally pushed \nout of bounds. The entire play has taken less than ten seconds.\nTwo minutes later, the Bucs score a touchdown, taking the lead \nfor the ﬁ  rst time all game. Five minutes later, they kick a ﬁ  eld goal. \nIn between, Dungy’s defense shuts down each of San Diego’s come-back attempts. The Buccaneers win, 25 to 17, one of the biggest upsets of the season.\nAt the end of the game, Lynch and Dungy exit the ﬁ  eld together.\n“It feels like something was different out there,” Lynch says as \nthey walk into the tunnel.\n“We’re starting to believe,” Dungy replies.\nII.\nTo understand how a coach ’s focus on changing habits could re-make a team, it’s necessary to look outside the world of sports. Way outside, to a dingy basement on the Lower East Side of New York City in 1934, where one of the largest and most successful attempts at  wide- scale habit change was born.\nSitting in the basement was a  thirty- nine- year- old alcoholic \nnamed Bill Wilson. Years earlier, Wilson had taken his ﬁ  rst drink \nduring ofﬁ  cers’ training camp in New Bedford, Massachusetts, \nwhere he was learning to ﬁ  re machine guns before getting shipped \nto France and World War I. Prominent families who lived near the base often invited ofﬁ  cers to dinner, and one Sunday night, Wilson \nattended a party where he was served rarebit and beer. He was  twenty- two years old and had never had alcohol before.

    "text": " Rule of Habit Change ● 67\npolite thing, it seemed, was to drink the glass served to him. A few \nweeks later, Wilson was invited to another elegant affair. Men were in tuxedos, women were ﬂ  irting. A butler came by and put a Bronx \n cocktail— a combination of gin, dry and sweet vermouth, and or-ange  juice— into Wilson ’s hand. He took a sip and felt, he later said, as if he had found “the elixir of life.”\nBy the mid-1930s, back from Europe, his marriage falling apart \nand a fortune from selling stocks vaporized, Wilson was consuming three bottles of booze a day. On a cold November afternoon, while he was sitting in the gloom, an old drinking buddy called. Wilson invited him over and mixed a pitcher of pineapple juice and gin. He poured his friend a glass.\nHis friend handed it back. He’d been sober for two months, he \nsaid.\nWilson was astonished. He started describing his own struggles \nwith alcohol, including the ﬁ  ght he’d gotten into at a country club \nthat had cost him his job. He had tried to quit, he said, but couldn ’t manage it. He’d been to detox and had taken pills. He’d made prom-ises to his wife and joined abstinence groups. None of it worked. How, Wilson asked, had his friend done it?\n“I got religion,” the friend said. He talked about hell and tempta-\ntion, sin and the devil. “Realize you are licked, admit it, and get will-ing to turn your life over to God.”\nWilson thought the guy was nuts. “Last summer an alcoholic \ncrackpot; now, I suspected, a little cracked about religion,” he later wrote. When his friend left, Wilson polished off the booze and went to bed.\nA month later, in December 1934, Wilson checked into the \nCharles B. Towns Hospital for Drug and Alcohol Addictions, an up-scale Manhattan detox center. A physician started hourly infusions of a hallucinogenic drug called belladonna, then in vogue for the treatment of alcoholism. Wilson ﬂ  oated in and out of consciousness \non a bed in a small room.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   67 Duhi_9781400069286_2p",

He had tried to quit, he said, but couldn ’t manage it. He’d been to detox and had taken pills. He’d made prom-ises to his wife and joined abstinence groups. None of it worked. How, Wilson asked, had his friend done it?\n“I got religion,” the friend said.

When his friend left, Wilson polished off the booze and went to bed.\nA month later, in December 1934, Wilson checked into the \nCharles B. Towns Hospital for Drug and Alcohol Addictions, an up-scale Manhattan detox center.

For days, he hallucinated. The withdrawal pains made it feel as if insects were crawling across his skin. He was so nauseous he could hardly move, but the pain was too intense to stay still. “If there is a God, let Him show Himself!” Wilson yelled to his empty room. “I am ready to do anything. Anything!” At that mo-ment, he later wrote, a white light ﬁ  lled his room, the pain ceased, \nand he felt as if he were on a mountaintop, “and that a wind not of air but of spirit was blowing. And then it burst upon me that I was a free man. Slowly the ecstasy subsided. I lay on the bed, but now for a time I was in another world, a new world of consciousness.”\nBill Wilson would never have another drink. For the next  thirty- six \nyears, until he died of emphysema in 1971, he would devote himself to founding, building, and spreading Alcoholics Anonymous, until it became the largest, most  well- known and successful  habit- changing organization in the world.\nAn estimated 2.1 million people seek help from AA each year, \nand as many as 10 million alcoholics may have achieved sobriety through the group. AA doesn ’t work for  everyone— success rates are difﬁ cult to measure, because of participants’  anonymity— but mil-\nlions credit the program with saving their lives. AA’s foundational credo, the famous twelve steps, have become cultural lodestones in-corporated into treatment programs for overeating, gambling, debt, sex, drugs, hoarding,  self- mutilation, smoking, video game addic-tions, emotional dependency, and dozens of other destructive be-haviors. The group’s techniques offer, in many respects, one of the most powerful formulas for change.\nAll of which is somewhat unexpected, because AA has almost no \ngrounding in science or most accepted therapeutic methods.\nAlcoholism, of course, is more than a habit. It’s a physical addic-\ntion with psychological and perhaps genetic roots. What’s interest-ing about AA, however, is that the program doesn ’t directly attack \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   68 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   68 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Golden Rule of Habit Change ● 69\nmany of the psychiatric or biochemical issues that researchers say \nare often at the core of why alcoholics drink. In fact, AA’s methods seem to sidestep scientiﬁ  c and medical ﬁ  ndings altogether, as well \nas the types of intervention many psychiatrists say alcoholics really need.\n*\nWhat AA provides instead is a method for attacking the habits \nthat surround alcohol use. AA, in essence, is a giant machine for changing habit loops. And though the habits associated with alco-holism are extreme, the lessons AA provides demonstrate how al-most any  habit— even the most  obstinate— can be changed.\n● ● ●\nBill Wilson didn ’t read academic journals or consult many doctors \nbefore founding AA. A few years after he achieved sobriety, he wrote the  now- famous twelve steps in a rush one night while sitting in bed. He chose the number twelve because there were twelve apos-\n* The line separating habits and addictions is often difﬁ  cult to measure. For instance, the \nAmerican Society of Addiction Medicine deﬁ  nes addiction as “a primary, chronic disease of brain \nreward, motivation, memory and related circuitry. . . . Addiction is characterized by impairment in behavioral control, craving, inability to consistently abstain, and diminished relationships.”\nBy that deﬁ  nition, some researchers note, it is difﬁ  cult to determine why spending ﬁ  fty dollars \na week on cocaine is bad, but ﬁ  fty dollars a week on coffee is okay. Someone who craves a latte \nevery afternoon may seem clinically addicted to an observer who thinks ﬁ  ve dollars for coffee \ndemonstrates an “impairment in behavioral control.” Is someone who would prefer running to having breakfast with his kids addicted to exercise?\nIn general, say many researchers, while addiction is complicated and still poorly understood, \nmany of the behaviors that we",

For days, he hallucinated. The withdrawal pains made it feel as if insects were crawling across his skin. He was so nauseous he could hardly move, but the pain was too intense to stay still. “If there is a God, let Him show Himself!” Wilson yelled to his empty room. “I am ready to do anything.

AA doesn ’t work for  everyone— success rates are difﬁ cult to measure, because of participants’  anonymity— but mil-\nlions credit the program with saving their lives. AA’s foundational credo, the famous twelve steps, have become cultural lodestones in-corporated into treatment programs for overeating, gambling, debt, sex, drugs, hoarding,  self- mutilation, smoking, video game addic-tions, emotional dependency, and dozens of other destructive be-haviors. The group’s techniques offer, in many respects, one of the most powerful formulas for change.\nAll of which is somewhat unexpected, because AA has almost no \ngrounding in science or most accepted therapeutic methods.\nAlcoholism, of course, is more than a habit.

Some substances, such as drugs, cigarettes, or alcohol, can create physical dependencies. But these physical cravings often fade quickly after use is discontinued. A physical addiction to nicotine, for instance, lasts only as long as the chemical is in a smoker’s bloodstream—about one hundred hours after the last cigarette. Many of the lingering urges that we think of as nicotine’s addictive twinges are re-ally behavioral habits asserting themselves—we crave a cigarette at breakfast a month later not because we physically need it, but because we remember so fondly the rush it once provided each morning. Attacking the behaviors we think of as addictions by modifying the habits surrounding them has been shown, in clinical studies, to be one of the most effective modes of treatment. (Though it is worth noting that some chemicals, such as opiates, can cause prolonged physical addictions, and some studies indicate that a small group of people seem predisposed to seek out addictive chemicals, regardless of behavioral interventions. The number of chemicals that cause long-term physical addictions, however, is relatively small, and the number of predisposed addicts is estimated to be much less than the number of alcoholics and addicts seeking help.)\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   69 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   69 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n70 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\ntles. And some aspects of the program are not just unscientiﬁ  c, they \ncan seem downright strange.\nTake, for instance, AA’s insistence that alcoholics attend “ninety \nmeetings in ninety days”—a stretch of time, it appears, chosen at random. Or the program ’s intense focus on spirituality, as articu-lated in step three, which says that alcoholics can achieve sobriety by making “a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understand him.” Seven of the twelve steps mention God or spirituality, which seems odd for a program founded by a  onetime agnostic who, throughout his life, was openly hostile toward orga-nized religion. AA meetings don ’t have a prescribed schedule or cur-riculum. Rather, they usually begin with a member telling his or her story, after which other people can chime in. There are no profes-sionals who guide conversations and few rules about how meetings are supposed to function. In the past ﬁ  ve decades, as almost every \naspect of psychiatry and addiction research has been revolutionized by discoveries in behavioral sciences, pharmacology, and our under-standing of the brain, AA has remained frozen in time.\nBecause of the program ’s lack of rigor, academics and research-\ners have often criticized it. AA’s emphasis on spirituality, some claimed, made it more like a cult than a treatment. In the past ﬁ  f-\nteen years, however, a reevaluation has begun. Researchers now say the program ’s methods offer valuable lessons. Faculty at Harvard, Yale, the University of Chicago, the University of New Mexico, and dozens of other research centers have found a kind of science within AA that is similar to the one Tony Dungy used on the football ﬁ  eld. \nTheir ﬁ  ndings endorse the Golden Rule of habit change: AA suc-\nceeds because it helps alcoholics use the same cues, and get the same reward, but it shifts the routine.\nResearchers say that AA works because the program forces peo-\nple to identify the cues and rewards that encourage their alcoholic habits, and then helps them ﬁ  nd new behaviors. When Claude Hop-\nkins was selling Pepsodent, he found a way to create a new habit by \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   70 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   70 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Golden Rule of Habit Change ● 71\ntriggering a new craving. But to change an old habit, you must ad-\ndress an old craving. You have to keep the same cues and rewards as before, and feed the craving by inserting a new routine.\nTake steps four (to make “a searching and fearless inventory of \nourselves”) and ﬁ  ve (to admit “to God, to ourselves, and to another \nhuman being the exact nature of our wrongs”).\n“It’s not obvious from the",

Some substances, such as drugs, cigarettes, or alcohol, can create physical dependencies. But these physical cravings often fade quickly after use is discontinued. A physical addiction to nicotine, for instance, lasts only as long as the chemical is in a smoker’s bloodstream—about one hundred hours after the last cigarette. Many of the lingering urges that we think of as nicotine’s addictive twinges are re-ally behavioral habits asserting themselves—we crave a cigarette at breakfast a month later not because we physically need it, but because we remember so fondly the rush it once provided each morning. Attacking the behaviors we think of as addictions by modifying the habits surrounding them has been shown, in clinical studies, to be one of the most effective modes of treatment. (Though it is worth noting that some chemicals, such as opiates, can cause prolonged physical addictions, and some studies indicate that a small group of people seem predisposed to seek out addictive chemicals, regardless of behavioral interventions. The number of chemicals that cause long-term physical addictions, however, is relatively small, and the number of predisposed addicts is estimated to be much less than the number of alcoholics and addicts seeking help.)\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   69 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   69 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n70 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\ntles. And some aspects of the program are not just unscientiﬁ  c, they \ncan seem downright strange.\nTake, for instance, AA’s insistence that alcoholics attend “ninety \nmeetings in ninety days”—a stretch of time, it appears, chosen at random. Or the program ’s intense focus on spirituality, as articu-lated in step three, which says that alcoholics can achieve sobriety by making “a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understand him.” Seven of the twelve steps mention God or spirituality, which seems odd for a program founded by a  onetime agnostic who, throughout his",

    "text": " making “a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understand him.” Seven of the twelve steps mention God or spirituality, which seems odd for a program founded by a  onetime agnostic who, throughout his life, was openly hostile toward orga-nized religion. AA meetings don ’t have a prescribed schedule or cur-riculum. Rather, they usually begin with a member telling his or her story, after which other people can chime in. There are no profes-sionals who guide conversations and few rules about how meetings are supposed to function. In the past ﬁ  ve decades, as almost every \naspect of psychiatry and addiction research has been revolutionized by discoveries in behavioral sciences, pharmacology, and our under-standing of the brain, AA has remained frozen in time.\nBecause of the program ’s lack of rigor, academics and research-\ners have often criticized it. AA’s emphasis on spirituality, some claimed, made it more like a cult than a treatment. In the past ﬁ  f-\nteen years, however, a reevaluation has begun. Researchers now say the program ’s methods offer valuable lessons. Faculty at Harvard, Yale, the University of Chicago, the University of New Mexico, and dozens of other research centers have found a kind of science within AA that is similar to the one Tony Dungy used on the football ﬁ  eld. \nTheir ﬁ  ndings endorse the Golden Rule of habit change: AA suc-\nceeds because it helps alcoholics use the same cues, and get the same reward, but it shifts the routine.\nResearchers say that AA works because the program forces peo-\nple to identify the cues and rewards that encourage their alcoholic habits, and then helps them ﬁ  nd new behaviors. When Claude Hop-\nkins was selling Pepsodent, he found a way to create a new habit by \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   70 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   70 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Golden Rule of Habit Change ● 71\ntriggering a new craving.

Faculty at Harvard, Yale, the University of Chicago, the University of New Mexico, and dozens of other research centers have found a kind of science within AA that is similar to the one Tony Dungy used on the football ﬁ  eld. \nTheir ﬁ  ndings endorse the Golden Rule of habit change: AA suc-\nceeds because it helps alcoholics use the same cues, and get the same reward, but it shifts the routine.\nResearchers say that AA works because the program forces peo-\nple to identify the cues and rewards that encourage their alcoholic habits, and then helps them ﬁ  nd new behaviors.

Scott Tonigan, a researcher at the University of New Mexico who has studied AA for more than a decade. “When you make a  self- inventory, you’re ﬁ  guring out all the things that \nmake you drink. And admitting to someone else all the bad things you’ve done is a pretty good way of ﬁ  guring out the moments where \neverything spiraled out of control.”\nThen, AA asks alcoholics to search for the rewards they get from \nalcohol. What cravings, the program asks, are driving your habit loop? Often, intoxication itself doesn ’t make the list. Alcoholics crave a drink because it offers escape, relaxation, companionship, the blunting of anxieties, and an opportunity for emotional release. They might crave a cocktail to forget their worries. But they don ’t necessarily crave feeling drunk. The physical effects of alcohol are often one of the least rewarding parts of drinking for addicts.\n“There is a hedonistic element to alcohol,” said Ulf Mueller, a Ger-\nman neurologist who has studied brain activity among alcoholics. “But people also use alcohol because they want to forget something or to satisfy other cravings, and these relief cravings occur in totally dif-ferent parts of the brain than the craving for physical pleasure.”\nIn order to offer alcoholics the same rewards they get at a bar, AA \nhas built a system of meetings and  companionship— the “sponsor” each member works  with— that strives to offer as much escape, dis-traction, and catharsis as a Friday night bender. If someone needs relief, they can get it from talking to their sponsor or attending a group gathering, rather than toasting a drinking buddy.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   71 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   71 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n72 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\n“ AA forces you to create new routines for what to do each night \ninstead of drinking,” said Tonigan. “You can relax and talk through your anxieties at the meetings. The triggers and payoffs stay the same, it’s just the behavior that changes.”\nOne particularly dramatic demonstration of how alcoholics’ cues \nand rewards can be transferred to new routines occurred in 2007, when Mueller, the German neurologist, and his colleagues at the University of Magdeburg implanted small electrical devices inside the brains of ﬁ  ve alcoholics who had repeatedly tried to give up \nbooze. The alcoholics in the study had each spent at least six months in rehab without success. One of them had been through detox more than sixty times.\nThe devices implanted in the men ’s heads were positioned inside \ntheir basal  ganglia— the same part of the brain where the MIT re-searchers found the habit  loop— and they emitted an electrical charge that interrupted the neurological reward that triggers habitual crav-ings. After the men recovered from the operations, they were ex-posed to cues that had once triggered alcoholic urges, such as photos of beer or trips to a bar. Normally, it would have been impossible for KEEP THE CUE, \nPROVIDE THE SAME REWARD,\nINSERT A NEW ROUTINERoutine Routine\nReward CueCRAVING \nFOR RELIEF\nReward CueCRAVING \nFOR RELIEF\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   72 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   72 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Golden Rule of Habit Change ● 73\nthem to resist a drink. But the devices inside their brains “overrode” \neach man ’s neurological cravings. They didn ’t touch a drop.\n“One of them told me the craving disappeared as soon as we \nturned the electricity on,” Mueller said. “Then, we turned it off, and the craving came back immediately.”\nEradicating the alcoholics’ neurological cravings, however, wasn ’t \nenough to stop their drinking habits. Four of them relapsed soon after the surgery, usually after a stressful event. They picked up a bottle because that’s how they automatically dealt with anxiety. However, once they learned alternate routines for dealing with stress, the drinking stopped for good. One",

Scott Tonigan, a researcher at the University of New Mexico who has studied AA for more than a decade. “When you make a  self- inventory, you’re ﬁ  guring out all the things that \nmake you drink. And admitting to someone else all the bad things you’ve done is a pretty good way of ﬁ  guring out the moments where \neverything spiraled out of control.”\nThen, AA asks alcoholics to search for the rewards they get from \nalcohol. What cravings, the program asks, are driving your habit loop? Often, intoxication itself doesn ’t make the list. Alcoholics crave a drink because it offers escape, relaxation, companionship, the blunting of anxieties, and an opportunity for emotional release. They might crave a cocktail to forget their worries. But they don ’t necessarily crave feeling drunk. The physical effects of alcohol are often one of the least rewarding parts of drinking for addicts.\n“There is a hedonistic element to alcohol,” said Ulf Mueller, a Ger-\nman neurologist who has studied brain activity among alcoholics. “But people also use alcohol because they want to forget something or to satisfy other cravings, and these relief cravings occur in totally dif-ferent parts of the brain than the craving for physical pleasure.”\nIn order to offer alcoholics the same rewards they get at a bar, AA \nhas built a system of meetings and  companionship— the “sponsor” each member works  with— that strives to offer as much escape, dis-traction, and catharsis as a Friday night bender. If someone needs relief, they can get it from talking to their sponsor or attending a group gathering, rather than toasting a drinking buddy.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   71 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   71 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n72 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\n“ AA forces you",

Scott Tonigan, a researcher at the University of New Mexico who has studied AA for more than a decade. “When you make a  self- inventory, you’re ﬁ  guring out all the things that \nmake you drink. And admitting to someone else all the bad things you’ve done is a pretty good way of ﬁ  guring out the moments where \neverything spiraled out of control.”\nThen, AA asks alcoholics to search for the rewards they get from \nalcohol. What cravings, the program asks, are driving your habit loop? Often, intoxication itself doesn ’t make the list. Alcoholics crave a drink because it offers escape, relaxation, companionship, the blunting of anxieties, and an opportunity for emotional release. They might crave a cocktail to forget their worries. But they don ’t necessarily crave feeling drunk.",

    "text": ". Alcoholics crave a drink because it offers escape, relaxation, companionship, the blunting of anxieties, and an opportunity for emotional release. They might crave a cocktail to forget their worries. But they don ’t necessarily crave feeling drunk. The physical effects of alcohol are often one of the least rewarding parts of drinking for addicts.\n“There is a hedonistic element to alcohol,” said Ulf Mueller, a Ger-\nman neurologist who has studied brain activity among alcoholics. “But people also use alcohol because they want to forget something or to satisfy other cravings, and these relief cravings occur in totally dif-ferent parts of the brain than the craving for physical pleasure.”\nIn order to offer alcoholics the same rewards they get at a bar, AA \nhas built a system of meetings and  companionship— the “sponsor” each member works  with— that strives to offer as much escape, dis-traction, and catharsis as a Friday night bender. If someone needs relief, they can get it from talking to their sponsor or attending a group gathering, rather than toasting a drinking buddy.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   71 Duhi_9781400069286",

The triggers and payoffs stay the same, it’s just the behavior that changes.”\nOne particularly dramatic demonstration of how alcoholics’ cues \nand rewards can be transferred to new routines occurred in 2007, when Mueller, the German neurologist, and his colleagues at the University of Magdeburg implanted small electrical devices inside the brains of ﬁ  ve alcoholics who had repeatedly tried to give up \nbooze. The alcoholics in the study had each spent at least six months in rehab without success. One of them had been through detox more than sixty times.\nThe devices implanted in the men ’s heads were positioned inside \ntheir basal  ganglia— the same part of the brain where the MIT re-searchers found the habit  loop— and they emitted an electrical charge that interrupted the neurological reward that triggers habitual crav-ings. After the men recovered from the operations, they were ex-posed to cues that had once triggered alcoholic urges, such as photos of beer or trips to a bar. Normally, it would have been impossible for KEEP THE CUE, \nPROVIDE THE SAME REWARD,\nINSERT A NEW ROUTINERoutine Routine\nReward CueCRAVING \nFOR RELIEF\nReward CueCRAVING \nFOR RELIEF\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   72 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   72 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Golden Rule of Habit Change ● 73\nthem to resist a drink. But the devices inside their brains “overrode” \neach man ’s neurological cravings. They didn ’t touch a drop.\n“One of them told me the craving disappeared as soon as we \nturned the electricity on,” Mueller said. “Then, we turned it off, and the craving came back immediately.”\nEradicating the alcoholics’ neurological cravings, however, wasn ’t \nenough to stop their drinking habits.",

The triggers and payoffs stay the same, it’s just the behavior that changes.”\nOne particularly dramatic demonstration of how alcoholics’ cues \nand rewards can be transferred to new routines occurred in 2007, when Mueller, the German neurologist, and his colleagues at the University of Magdeburg implanted small electrical devices inside the brains of ﬁ  ve alcoholics who had repeatedly tried to give up \nbooze. The alcoholics in the study had each spent at least six months in rehab without success. One of them had been through detox more than sixty times.\nThe devices implanted in the men ’s heads were positioned inside \ntheir basal  ganglia— the same part of the brain where the MIT re-searchers found the habit  loop— and they emitted an electrical charge that interrupted the neurological reward that triggers habitual crav-ings.

    "text": " Four of them relapsed soon after the surgery, usually after a stressful event. They picked up a bottle because that’s how they automatically dealt with anxiety. However, once they learned alternate routines for dealing with stress, the drinking stopped for good. One patient, for instance, at-tended AA meetings. Others went to therapy. And once they incor-porated those new routines for coping with stress and anxiety into their lives, the successes were dramatic. The man who had gone to detox sixty times never had another drink. Two other patients had started drinking at twelve, were alcoholics by eighteen, drank every day, and now have been sober for four years.\nNotice how closely this study hews to the Golden Rule of habit \nchange: Even when alcoholics’ brains were changed through sur-gery, it wasn ’t enough. The old cues and cravings for rewards were still there, waiting to pounce. The alcoholics only permanently changed once they learned new routines that drew on the old trig-gers and provided a familiar relief. “Some brains are so addicted to alcohol that only surgery can stop it,” said Mueller. “But those peo-ple also need new ways for dealing with life.”\nAA provides a similar, though less invasive, system for inserting \nnew routines into old habit loops. As scientists have begun under-standing how AA works, they’ve started applying the program ’s methods to other habits, such as  two- year- olds’ tantrums, sex addic-tions, and even minor behavioral tics. As AA’s methods have spread, they’ve been reﬁ  ned into therapies that can be used to disrupt al-\nmost any pattern.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   73 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   73 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n74 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\n● ● ●\nIn the summer of 2006, a  twenty- four- year- old graduate student \nnamed Mandy walked into the counseling center at Mississippi State University. For most of her life, Mandy had bitten her nails, gnawing them until they bled. Lots of people bite their nails. For chronic nail biters, however, it’s a problem of a different scale. Mandy would often bite until her nails pulled away from the skin underneath. Her ﬁ  ngertips were covered with tiny scabs. The end of \nher ﬁ  ngers had become blunted without nails to protect them and \nsometimes they tingled or itched, a sign of nerve injury. The biting habit had damaged her social life. She was so embarrassed around her friends that she kept her hands in her pockets and, on dates, would become preoccupied with balling her ﬁ  ngers into ﬁ  sts. She \nhad tried to stop by painting her nails with  foul- tasting polishes or promising herself, starting right now, that she would muster the \nwillpower to quit. But as soon as she began doing homework or watching television, her ﬁ  ngers ended up in her mouth.\nThe counseling center referred Mandy to a doctoral psychology \nstudent who was studying a treatment known as “habit reversal training.” The psychologist was well acquainted with the Golden Rule of habit change. He knew that changing Mandy’s nail biting habit required inserting a new routine into her life.\n“What do you feel right before you bring your hand up to your \nmouth to bite your nails?” he asked her.\n“There’s a little bit of tension in my ﬁ  ngers,” Mandy said. “It hurts \na little bit here, at the edge of the nail. Sometimes I’ll run my thumb along, looking for hangnails, and when I feel something catch, I’ll bring it up to my mouth then. I’ll go ﬁ  nger by ﬁ  nger, biting all the \nrough edges. Once I start, it feels like I have to do all of them.”\nAsking patients to describe what triggers their habitual behavior \nis called awareness training, and like AA’s insistence on forcing al-coholics to recognize their cues, it’s the ﬁ  rst step in habit reversal \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   74 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   74 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Golden Rule of Habit Change ● 75\ntraining. The tension that Mandy felt in her nails cued her nail bit-\ning habit.\n“Most people’s habits have occurred for so long they don ’t pay \nattention to what causes it anymore,” said Brad Dufrene, who treated Mandy",

    "text": " Four of them relapsed soon after the surgery, usually after a stressful event. They picked up a bottle because that’s how they automatically dealt with anxiety. However, once they learned alternate routines for dealing with stress, the drinking stopped for good. One patient, for instance, at-tended AA meetings. Others went to therapy. And once they incor-porated those new routines for coping with stress and anxiety into their lives, the successes were dramatic. The man who had gone to detox sixty times never had another drink. Two other patients had started drinking at twelve, were alcoholics by eighteen, drank every day, and now have been sober for four years.\nNotice how closely this study hews to the Golden Rule of habit \nchange: Even when alcoholics’ brains were changed through sur-gery, it wasn ’t enough. The old cues and cravings for rewards were still there, waiting to pounce. The alcoholics only permanently changed once they learned new routines that drew on the old trig-gers and provided a familiar relief. “Some brains are so addicted to alcohol that only surgery can stop it,” said Mueller. “But those peo-ple also need new ways for dealing with life.”\nAA provides a similar, though less invasive, system for inserting \nnew routines into old habit loops. As scientists have begun under-standing how AA works, they’ve started applying the program ’s methods to other habits, such as  two- year- olds’ tantrums, sex addic-tions, and even minor behavioral tics. As AA’s methods have spread, they’ve been reﬁ  ned into therapies that can be used to disrupt al-\nmost any pattern.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   73 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   73 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n74 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\n● ● ●\nIn the summer of 2006, a  twenty- four- year- old graduate student \nnamed Mandy walked into the counseling center at Mississippi State University. For most of her life, Mandy had bitten her nails, gnawing them until they bled. Lots of people bite their nails. For chronic nail biters, however, it’s a problem of a different scale. Mandy would often bite until her nails pulled away from the skin underneath.",

For most of her life, Mandy had bitten her nails, gnawing them until they bled. Lots of people bite their nails. For chronic nail biters, however, it’s a problem of a different scale. Mandy would often bite until her nails pulled away from the skin underneath.",

Mandy would often bite until her nails pulled away from the skin underneath. Her ﬁ  ngertips were covered with tiny scabs. The end of \nher ﬁ  ngers had become blunted without nails to protect them and \nsometimes they tingled or itched, a sign of nerve injury. The biting habit had damaged her social life. She was so embarrassed around her friends that she kept her hands in her pockets and, on dates, would become preoccupied with balling her ﬁ  ngers into ﬁ  sts. She \nhad tried to stop by painting her nails with  foul- tasting polishes or promising herself, starting right now, that she would muster the \nwillpower to quit. But as soon as she began doing homework or watching television, her ﬁ  ngers ended up in her mouth.\nThe counseling center referred Mandy to a doctoral psychology \nstudent who was studying a treatment known as “habit reversal training.” The psychologist was well acquainted with the Golden Rule of habit change. He knew that changing Mandy’s nail biting habit required inserting a new routine into her life.\n“What do you feel right before you bring your hand up to your \nmouth to bite your nails?” he asked her.\n“There’s a little bit of tension in my ﬁ  ngers,” Mandy said. “It hurts \na little bit here, at the edge of the nail. Sometimes I’ll run my thumb along, looking for hangnails, and when I feel something catch, I’ll bring it up to my mouth then. I’ll go ﬁ  nger by ﬁ  nger, biting all the \nrough edges. Once I start, it feels like I have to do all of them.”\nAsking patients to describe what triggers their habitual behavior \nis called awareness training, and like AA’s insistence on forcing al-coholics to recognize their cues, it’s the ﬁ  rst step in habit reversal \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   74 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   74 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Golden Rule of Habit Change ● 75\ntraining.

As they talked, \nthough, it became clearer that she bit when she was bored. The ther-apist put her in some typical situations, such as watching television and doing homework, and she started nibbling. When she had worked through all of the nails, she felt a brief sense of complete-ness, she said. That was the habit’s reward: a physical stimulation she had come to crave.\nAt the end of their ﬁ  rst session, the therapist sent Mandy home \nwith an assignment: Carry around an index card, and each time you feel the  cue— a tension in your  ﬁ  ngertips— make a check mark on \nthe card. She came back a week later with  twenty- eight checks. She was, by that point, acutely aware of the sensations that preceded her habit. She knew how many times it occurred during class or while watching television.\nThen the therapist taught Mandy what is known as a “competing Routine\nReward\nMANDY’S HABIT LOOPCueCRAVING \nFOR \nSTIMULATION\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   75 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   75 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n76 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nresponse.” Whenever she felt that tension in her ﬁ  ngertips, he told \nher, she should immediately put her hands in her pockets or under her legs, or grip a pencil or something else that made it impossible to put her ﬁ  ngers in her mouth. Then Mandy was to search for \nsomething that would provide a quick physical  stimulation— such as rubbing her arm or rapping her knuckles on a  desk— anything that would produce a physical response.\nThe cues and rewards stayed the same. Only the routine \nchanged.\nThey practiced in the therapist’s ofﬁ  ce for about thirty minutes \nand Mandy was sent home with a new assignment: Continue with the index card, but make a check when you feel the tension in your ﬁ ngertips and a hash mark when you successfully override the \nhabit.\nA week later, Mandy had bitten her nails only three times and \nhad used the competing response seven times. She rewarded her-self with a manicure, but kept using the note cards. After a month, the  nail- biting habit was gone. The competing routines had become automatic. One habit had replaced another.\n“It seems ridiculously simple, but once you’re aware of how your \nhabit works, once you recognize the cues and rewards, you’re half-way to changing it,” Nathan Azrin, one of the developers of habit reversal training, told me. “It seems like it should be more complex.

You just have to be \ndeliberate about it.”*\nToday, habit reversal therapy is used to treat verbal and physical \ntics, depression, smoking, gambling problems, anxiety, bedwetting, procrastination,  obsessive- compulsive disorders, and other behav-ioral problems. And its techniques lay bare one of the fundamental principles of habits: Often, we don ’t really understand the cravings driving our behaviors until we look for them. Mandy never realized that a craving for physical stimulation was causing her nail biting, but once she dissected the habit, it became easy to ﬁ  nd a new rou-\ntine that provided the same reward.\nSay you want to stop snacking at work. Is the reward you’re seek-\ning to satisfy your hunger? Or is it to interrupt boredom? If you snack for a brief release, you can easily ﬁ  nd another  routine— such as taking \n* It is important to note that though the process",

    "text": " tension that Mandy felt in her nails cued her nail bit-\ning habit.\n“Most people’s habits have occurred for so long they don ’t pay \nattention to what causes it anymore,” said Brad Dufrene, who treated Mandy. “I’ve had stutterers come in, and I’ll ask them which words or situations trigger their stuttering, and they won ’t know because they stopped noticing so long ago.”\nNext, the therapist asked Mandy to describe why she bit her nails. \nAt ﬁ rst, she had trouble coming up with reasons. As they talked, \nthough, it became clearer that she bit when she was bored. The ther-apist put her in some typical situations, such as watching television and doing homework, and she started nibbling. When she had worked through all of the nails, she felt a brief sense of complete-ness, she said. That was the habit’s reward: a physical stimulation she had come to crave.\nAt the end of their ﬁ  rst session, the therapist sent Mandy home \nwith an assignment: Carry around an index card, and each time you feel the  cue— a tension in your  ﬁ  ngertips— make a check mark on \nthe card",

Then Mandy was to search for \nsomething that would provide a quick physical  stimulation— such as rubbing her arm or rapping her knuckles on a  desk— anything that would produce a physical response.\nThe cues and rewards stayed the same. Only the routine \nchanged.\nThey practiced in the therapist’s ofﬁ  ce for about thirty minutes \nand Mandy was sent home with a new assignment: Continue with the index card, but make a check when you feel the tension in your ﬁ ngertips and a hash mark when you successfully override the \nhabit.\nA week later, Mandy had bitten her nails only three times and \nhad used the competing response seven times. She rewarded her-self with a manicure, but kept using the note cards. After a month, the  nail- biting habit was gone. The competing routines had become automatic. One habit had replaced another.\n“It seems ridiculously simple, but once you’re aware of how your \nhabit works, once you recognize the cues and rewards, you’re half-way to changing it,” Nathan Azrin, one of the developers of habit reversal training, told me. “It seems like it should be more complex.

You just have to be \ndeliberate about it.”*\nToday, habit reversal therapy is used to treat verbal and physical \ntics, depression, smoking, gambling problems, anxiety, bedwetting, procrastination,  obsessive- compulsive disorders, and other behav-ioral problems. And its techniques lay bare one of the fundamental principles of habits: Often, we don ’t really understand the cravings driving our behaviors until we look for them. Mandy never realized that a craving for physical stimulation was causing her nail biting, but once she dissected the habit, it became easy to ﬁ  nd a new rou-\ntine that provided the same reward.\nSay you want to stop snacking at work.

Then Mandy was to search for \nsomething that would provide a quick physical  stimulation— such as rubbing her arm or rapping her knuckles on a  desk— anything that would produce a physical response.\nThe cues and rewards stayed the same. Only the routine \nchanged.\nThey practiced in the therapist’s ofﬁ  ce for about thirty minutes \nand Mandy was sent home with a new assignment: Continue with the index card, but make a check when you feel the tension in your ﬁ ngertips and a hash mark when you successfully override the \nhabit.\nA week later, Mandy had bitten her nails only three times and \nhad used the competing response seven times. She rewarded her-self with a manicure, but kept using the note cards. After a month, the  nail- biting habit was gone. The competing routines had become automatic. One habit had replaced another.\n“It seems ridiculously simple, but once you’re aware of how your \nhabit works, once you recognize the cues and rewards, you’re half-way to changing it,” Nathan Azrin, one of the developers of habit reversal training, told me. “It seems like it should be more complex.

If you snack for a brief release, you can easily ﬁ  nd another  routine— such as taking \n* It is important to note that though the process of habit change is easily described, it does not \nnecessarily follow that it is easily accomplished. It is facile to imply that smoking, alcoholism, over-eating, or other ingrained patterns can be upended without real effort. Genuine change requires work and self-understanding of the cravings driving behaviors. Changing any habit requires deter-mination. No one will quit smoking cigarettes simply because they sketch a habit loop.\nHowever, by understanding habits’ mechanisms, we gain insights that make new behaviors \neasier to grasp. Anyone struggling with addiction or destructive behaviors can beneﬁ  t from help \nfrom many quarters, including trained therapists, physicians, social workers, and clergy. Even professionals in those ﬁ  elds, though, agree that most alcoholics, smokers, and other people strug-\ngling with problematic behaviors quit on their own, away from formal treatment settings. Much of the time, those changes are accomplished because people examine the cues, cravings, and rewards that drive their behaviors and then ﬁ  nd ways to replace their self-destructive routines \nwith healthier alternatives, even if they aren ’t fully aware of what they are doing at the time. Un-derstanding the cues and cravings driving your habits won ’t make them suddenly disappear—but it will give you a way to plan how to change the pattern.

If you smoke because you need stimulation, studies indicate that some caffeine in the after-noon can increase the odds you’ll quit. More than three dozen stud-ies of former smokers have found that identifying the cues and rewards they associate with cigarettes, and then choosing new rou-tines that provide similar  payoffs— a piece of Nicorette, a quick se-ries of  push- ups, or simply taking a few minutes to stretch and  relax— makes it more likely they will quit.\nIf you identify the cues and rewards, you can change the routine.\nAt least, most of the time. For some habits, however, there’s one \nother ingredient that’s necessary: belief.\nIII.\n“Here are the six reasons everyone thinks we can ’t win,” Dungy told his Buccaneers after becoming head coach in 1996. It was months before the season started and everyone was sitting in the locker room. Dungy started listing the theories they had all read in the newspapers or heard on the radio: The team ’s management was CRAVING \nFOR \nSTIMULATIONCRAVING \nFOR \nSTIMULATIONRoutine\nReward Cue Reward CueRoutine\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   78 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   78 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Golden Rule of Habit Change ● 79\nmessed up. Their new coach was untested. The players were spoiled. \nThe city didn ’t care. Key players were injured. They didn ’t have the talent they needed.\n“Those are the supposed reasons,” Dungy said. “Now here is a \nfact: Nobody is going to outwork us.”\nDungy’s strategy, he explained, was to shift the team ’s behaviors \nuntil their performances were automatic. He didn ’t believe the Buc-caneers needed the thickest playbook. He didn ’t think they had to memorize hundreds of formations. They just had to learn a few key moves and get them right every time.\nHowever, perfection is hard to achieve in football. “Every play in \n football— every  play— someone messes up,” said Herm Edwards, one of Dungy’s assistant coaches in Tampa Bay. “Most of the time, it’s not physical. It’s mental.” Players mess up when they start think-ing too much or  second- guessing their plays. What Dungy wanted was",

It is facile to imply that smoking, alcoholism, over-eating, or other ingrained patterns can be upended without real effort. Genuine change requires work and self-understanding of the cravings driving behaviors. Changing any habit requires deter-mination. No one will quit smoking cigarettes simply because they sketch a habit loop.\nHowever, by understanding habits’ mechanisms, we gain insights that make new behaviors \neasier to grasp. Anyone struggling with addiction or destructive behaviors can beneﬁ  t from help \nfrom many quarters, including trained therapists, physicians, social workers, and clergy. Even professionals in those ﬁ  elds, though, agree that most alcoholics, smokers, and other people strug-\ngling with problematic behaviors quit on their own, away from formal treatment settings. Much of the time, those changes are accomplished because people examine the cues, cravings, and rewards that drive their behaviors and then ﬁ  nd ways to replace their self-destructive routines \nwith healthier alternatives, even if they aren ’t fully aware of what they are doing at the time. Un-derstanding the cues and cravings driving your habits won ’t make them suddenly disappear—but it will give you a way to plan how to change the pattern.

If you smoke because you need stimulation, studies indicate that some caffeine in the after-noon can increase the odds you’ll quit. More than three dozen stud-ies of former smokers have found that identifying the cues and rewards they associate with cigarettes, and then choosing new rou-tines that provide similar  payoffs— a piece of Nicorette, a quick se-ries of  push- ups, or simply taking a few minutes to stretch and  relax— makes it more likely they will quit.\nIf you identify the cues and rewards, you can change the routine.\nAt least, most of the time. For some habits, however, there’s one \nother ingredient that’s necessary: belief.\nIII.\n“Here are the six reasons everyone thinks we can ’t win,” Dungy told his Buccaneers after becoming head coach in 1996.

Their new coach was untested. The players were spoiled. \nThe city didn ’t care. Key players were injured. They didn ’t have the talent they needed.\n“Those are the supposed reasons,” Dungy said. “Now here is a \nfact: Nobody is going to outwork us.”\nDungy’s strategy, he explained, was to shift the team ’s behaviors \nuntil their performances were automatic. He didn ’t believe the Buc-caneers needed the thickest playbook. He didn ’t think they had to memorize hundreds of formations. They just had to learn a few key moves and get them right every time.\nHowever, perfection is hard to achieve in football. “Every play in \n football— every  play— someone messes up,” said Herm Edwards, one",

    "text": " because \nyou love nicotine, or because it provides a burst of stimulation, a structure to your day, a way to socialize? If you smoke because you need stimulation, studies indicate that some caffeine in the after-noon can increase the odds you’ll quit. More than three dozen stud-ies of former smokers have found that identifying the cues and rewards they associate with cigarettes, and then choosing new rou-tines that provide similar  payoffs— a piece of Nicorette, a quick se-ries of  push- ups, or simply taking a few minutes to stretch and  relax— makes it more likely they will quit.\nIf you identify the cues and rewards, you can change the routine.\nAt least, most of the time. For some habits, however, there’s one \nother ingredient that’s necessary: belief.\nIII.\n“Here are the six reasons everyone thinks we can ’t win,” Dungy told his Buccaneers after becoming head coach in 1996.

    "text": " of Dungy’s assistant coaches in Tampa Bay. “Most of the time, it’s not physical. It’s mental.” Players mess up when they start think-ing too much or  second- guessing their plays. What Dungy wanted was to take all that decision making out of their game.\nAnd to do that, he needed them to recognize their existing habits \nand accept new routines.\nHe started by watching how his team already played.“Let’s work on the Under Defense,” Dungy shouted at a morning \npractice one day. “Number  ﬁ fty- ﬁ  ve, what’s your read?”\n“I’m watching the running back and guard,” said Derrick Brooks, \nan outside linebacker.\n“What precisely are you looking  at? Where are your eyes?”\n“I’m looking at the movement of the guard,” said Brooks. “I’m \nwatching the QB’s legs and hips after he gets the ball. And I’m look-ing for gaps in the line, to see if they’re gonna pass and if the QB is going to throw to my side or away.”\nIn football, these visual cues are known as “keys,” and they’re \ncritical to every play. Dungy’s innovation was to use these keys as cues for reworked habits. He knew that, sometimes, Brooks hesi-tated a moment too long at the start of a play. There were so many things for him to think  about— is the guard stepping out of forma-\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   79 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   79 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n80 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\ntion? Does the running back’s foot indicate he’s preparing for a run-\nning or passing play?—that sometimes he slowed down.\nDungy’s goal was to free Brooks’s mind from all that analysis. \nLike Alcoholics Anonymous, he used the same cues that Brooks was already accustomed to, but gave him different routines that, eventu-ally, occurred automatically.\n“I want you to use those same keys,” Dungy told Brooks. “But at \nﬁ rst, focus only on the running back. That’s it. Do it without think-\ning. Once you’re in position, then start looking for the QB.”\nThis was a relatively modest  shift— Brooks’s eyes went to the \nsame cues, but rather than looking multiple places at once, Dungy put them in a sequence and told him, ahead of time, the choice to make when he saw each key. The brilliance of this system was that it removed the need for decision making. It allowed Brooks to move faster, because everything was a  reaction— and eventually a  habit— rather than a choice.\nDungy gave every player similar instructions, and practiced the \nformations over and over. It took almost a year for Dungy’s habits to take hold. The team lost early, easy games. Sports columnists asked why the Bucs were wasting so much time on psychological quackery.\nBut slowly, they began to improve. Eventually, the patterns be-\ncame so familiar to players that they unfolded automatically when the team took the ﬁ  eld. In Dungy’s second season as coach, the Bucs \nwon their ﬁ  rst ﬁ  ve games and went to the  play- offs for the ﬁ  rst time \nin ﬁ fteen years. In 1999, they won the division championship.\nDungy’s coaching style started drawing national attention. The \nsports media fell in love with his  soft- spoken demeanor, religious piety, and the importance he placed on balancing work and family. Newspaper stories described how he brought his sons, Eric and Jamie, to the stadium so they could hang out during practice. They did their homework in his ofﬁ  ce and picked up towels in the locker \nroom. It seemed like, ﬁ  nally, success had arrived.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   80 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   80 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Golden Rule of Habit Change ● 81\nIn 2000, the Bucs made it to the  play- offs again, and then again \nin 2001. Fans now ﬁ  lled the stadium every week. Sportscasters \ntalked about the team as Super Bowl contenders. It was all becom-ing real.\n● ● ●\nBut even as the Bucs became a powerhouse, a troubling problem emerged. They often played tight, disciplined games. However, dur-ing crucial",

What Dungy wanted was to take all that decision making out of their game.\nAnd to do that, he needed them to recognize their existing habits \nand accept new routines.\nHe started by watching how his team already played.“Let’s work on the Under Defense,” Dungy shouted at a morning \npractice one day. “Number  ﬁ fty- ﬁ  ve, what’s your read?”\n“I’m watching the running back and guard,” said Derrick Brooks, \nan outside linebacker.\n“What precisely are you looking  at? Where are your eyes?”\n“I’m looking at the movement of the guard,” said Brooks. “I’m \nwatching the QB’s legs and hips after he gets the ball. And I’m look-ing for gaps in the line, to see if they’re gonna pass and if the QB is going to throw to my side or away.”\nIn football, these visual cues are known as “keys,” and they’re \ncritical to every play. Dungy’s innovation was to use these keys as cues for reworked habits. He knew that, sometimes, Brooks hesi-tated a moment too long at the start of a play.

Does the running back’s foot indicate he’s preparing for a run-\nning or passing play?—that sometimes he slowed down.\nDungy’s goal was to free Brooks’s mind from all that analysis. \nLike Alcoholics Anonymous, he used the same cues that Brooks was already accustomed to, but gave him different routines that, eventu-ally, occurred automatically.\n“I want you to use those same keys,” Dungy told Brooks. “But at \nﬁ rst, focus only on the running back. That’s it. Do it without think-\ning. Once you’re in position, then start looking for the QB.”\nThis was a",

    "text": " keys,” Dungy told Brooks. “But at \nﬁ rst, focus only on the running back. That’s it. Do it without think-\ning. Once you’re in position, then start looking for the QB.”\nThis was a relatively modest  shift— Brooks’s eyes went to the \nsame cues, but rather than looking multiple places at once, Dungy put them in a sequence and told him, ahead of time, the choice to make when he saw each key. The brilliance of this system was that it removed the need for decision making. It allowed Brooks to move faster, because everything was a  reaction— and eventually a  habit— rather than a choice.\nDungy gave every player similar instructions, and practiced the \nformations over and over. It took almost a year for Dungy’s habits to take hold. The team lost early, easy games. Sports columnists asked why the Bucs were wasting so much time on psychological quackery.\nBut slowly, they began to improve. Eventually, the patterns be-\ncame so familiar to players that they unfolded automatically when the team took the ﬁ  eld. In Dungy’s second season as coach, the Bucs \nwon their ﬁ  rst ﬁ  ve games and went to the  play- offs for the ﬁ  rst time \nin ﬁ fteen years. In 1999, they won the division championship.\nDungy’s coaching style started drawing national attention. The \nsports media fell in love with his  soft- spoken demeanor, religious piety, and the importance he placed on balancing work and family. Newspaper stories described how he brought his sons, Eric and Jamie, to the stadium so they could hang out during practice. They did their homework in his ofﬁ  ce and picked up towels in the locker \nroom. It seemed like, ﬁ  nally, success had arrived.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   80 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   80 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Golden Rule of Habit Change ● 81\nIn 2000, the Bucs made it to the  play- offs again, and then again \nin 2001. Fans now ﬁ  lled the stadium every week. Sportscasters \n",

Newspaper stories described how he brought his sons, Eric and Jamie, to the stadium so they could hang out during practice. They did their homework in his ofﬁ  ce and picked up towels in the locker \nroom.

    "text": "talked about the team as Super Bowl contenders. It was all becom-ing real.\n● ● ●\nBut even as the Bucs became a powerhouse, a troubling problem emerged. They often played tight, disciplined games. However, dur-ing crucial,  high- stress moments, everything would fall apart.\nIn 1999, after racking up six wins in a row at the end of the sea-\nson, the Bucs blew the conference championship against the St. Louis Rams. In 2000, they were one game away from the Super Bowl when they disintegrated against the Philadelphia Eagles, los-ing 21 to 3. The next year, the same thing happened again, and the Bucs lost to the Eagles, 31 to 9, blowing their chance of advancing.\n“We would practice, and everything would come together and \nthen we’d get to a big game and it was like the training disappeared,” Dungy told me. “ Afterward, my players would say, ‘Well, it was a critical play and I went back to what I knew,’ or ‘I felt like I had to step it up.’ What they were really  saying was they trusted our system \nmost of the time, but when everything was on the line, that belief broke down.”\nAt the conclusion of the 2001 season, after the Bucs had missed \nthe Super Bowl for the second straight year, the team ’s general man-ager asked Dungy to come to his house. He parked near a huge oak tree, walked inside, and thirty seconds later was ﬁ  red.\nThe Bucs would go on to win the Super Bowl the next year using \nDungy’s formations and players, and by relying on the habits he had shaped. He would watch on television as the coach who replaced him lifted up the Lombardi trophy. But by then, he would already be far away.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   81 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   81 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n82 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nIV.\nAbout sixty  people— soccer moms and lawyers on lunch breaks, old \nguys with fading tattoos and hipsters in skinny  jeans— are sitting in a church and listening to a man with a slight paunch and a tie that complements his pale blue eyes. He looks like a successful politi-cian, with the warm charisma of assured reelection.\n“My name is John,” he says, “and I’m an alcoholic.”“Hi, John,” everyone replies.“The ﬁ  rst time I decided to get help was when my son broke his \narm,” John says. He’s standing behind a podium. “I was having an affair with a woman at work, and she told me that she wanted to end it. So I went to a bar and had two vodkas, and went back to my desk, and at lunch I went to Chili’s with a friend, and we each had a few beers, and then at about two o’clock, me and another friend left and found a place with  a two- for- one happy hour.

They often played tight, disciplined games. However, dur-ing crucial,  high- stress moments, everything would fall apart.\nIn 1999, after racking up six wins in a row at the end of the sea-\nson, the Bucs blew the conference championship against the St. Louis Rams. In 2000, they were one game away from the Super Bowl when they disintegrated against the Philadelphia Eagles, los-ing 21 to 3. The next year, the same thing happened again, and the Bucs lost to the Eagles, 31 to 9, blowing their chance of advancing.\n“We would practice, and everything would come together and \nthen we’d get to a big game and it was like the training disappeared,” Dungy told me. “ Afterward, my players would say, ‘Well, it was a critical play and I went back to what I knew,’ or ‘I felt like I had to step it up.’ What they were really  saying was they trusted our system \nmost of the time, but when everything was on the line, that belief broke down.”\nAt the conclusion of the 2001 season, after the Bucs had missed \nthe Super Bowl for the second straight year, the team ’s general man-ager asked Dungy to come to his house. He parked near a huge oak tree, walked inside, and thirty seconds later was ﬁ  red.\nThe Bucs would go on to win the Super Bowl the next year using \nDungy’s formations and players, and by relying on the habits he had shaped. He would watch on television as the coach who replaced him lifted up the Lombardi trophy. But by then, he would already be far away.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   81 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   81 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n82 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nIV.\nAbout sixty  people— soccer moms and lawyers on lunch breaks, old \nguys with fading tattoos and hipsters in skinny  jeans— are sitting in a church and listening to a man with a slight paunch and a",

    "text": ", it was a critical play and I went back to what I knew,’ or ‘I felt like I had to step it up.’ What they were really  saying was they trusted our system \nmost of the time, but when everything was on the line, that belief broke down.”\nAt the conclusion of the 2001 season, after the Bucs had missed \nthe Super Bowl for the second straight year, the team ’s general man-ager asked Dungy to come to his house. He parked near a huge oak tree, walked inside, and thirty seconds later was ﬁ  red.\nThe Bucs would go on to win the Super Bowl the next year using \nDungy’s formations and players, and by relying on the habits he had shaped. He would watch on television as the coach who replaced him lifted up the Lombardi trophy. But by then, he would already be far away.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   81 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   81 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n82 ● THE POWER OF H",

He looks like a successful politi-cian, with the warm charisma of assured reelection.\n“My name is John,” he says, “and I’m an alcoholic.”“Hi, John,” everyone replies.“The ﬁ  rst time I decided to get help was when my son broke his \narm,” John says. He’s standing behind a podium. “I was having an affair with a woman at work, and she told me that she wanted to end it. So I went to a bar and had two vodkas, and went back to my desk, and at lunch I went to Chili’s with a friend, and we each had a few beers, and then at about two o’clock, me and another friend left and found a place with  a two- for- one happy hour.

I felt like I was in control and I went to meetings every couple of days, but eventually I started thinking, I’m not such a loser \nthat I need to hang out with a bunch of drunks. So I stopped going.\n“Then my mom got cancer, and she called me at work, almost \ntwo years after I got sober. She was driving home from the doctor’s ofﬁ ce, and she said, ‘He told me we can treat it, but it’s pretty ad-\nvanced.’ The ﬁ  rst thing I did after I hung up is �",

I was in a really bad place by then. A friend was teaching me to use coke, and every after-noon I would do a line inside my ofﬁ  ce, and ﬁ  ve minutes later I \nwould get that little drip into the back of my throat and do another line.\n“ Anyways, it was my turn to get the kids. I was on the way to their \nschool and I felt totally ﬁ  ne, like I was on top of everything, and I \npulled into an intersection when the light was red and this huge truck slammed into my car. It actually ﬂ  ipped the car on its side. I \ndidn ’t have a scratch on me. I got out, and started trying to push my car over, because I ﬁ  gured, if I can make it home and leave before \nthe cops arrive, I’ll be ﬁ  ne. Of course that didn ’t work out, and when \nthey arrested me for DUI they showed me how the passenger side of the car was completely crushed in. That’s where Sammy usually sat. If he had been there, he would have been killed.\n“So I started going to meetings again, and my sponsor told me \nthat it didn ’t matter if I felt in control. Without a higher power in my life, without admitting my powerlessness, none of it was going to work. I thought that was  bull— I’m an atheist. But I knew that if something didn ’t change, I was going to kill my kids. So I started working at that, working at believing in something bigger than me. And it’s working. I don ’t know if it’s God or something else, but there is a power that has helped me stay sober for seven years now and I’m in awe of it. I don ’t wake up sober every  morning— I mean, I haven ’t had a drink in seven years, but some mornings I wake up feeling like I’m gonna fall down that day. Those days, I look for the higher power, and I call my sponsor, and most of the time we don ’t talk about drinking. We talk about life and marriage and my job, and by the time I’m ready for a shower, my head is on straight.”\nThe ﬁ  rst cracks in the theory that Alcoholics Anonymous suc-\nceeded solely by reprogramming participants’ habits started appear-ing a little over a decade ago and were caused by stories from \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   83 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   83 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n84 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nalcoholics like John. Researchers began ﬁ  nding that habit replace-\nment worked pretty well for many people until the stresses of  life— such as ﬁ  nding out your mom has cancer, or your marriage is \ncoming  apart— got too high, at which point alcoholics often fell off the wagon. Academics asked why, if habit replacement is so effec-tive, it seemed to fail at such critical moments. And as they dug into alcoholics’ stories to answer that question, they learned that replace-ment habits only become durable new behaviors when they are accompanied by something else.\nOne group of researchers at the Alcohol Research Group in Cali-\nfornia, for instance, noticed a pattern in interviews. Over and over again, alcoholics said the same thing: Identifying cues and choosing new routines is important, but without another ingredient, the new habits never fully took hold.\nThe secret, the alcoholics said, was God.Researchers hated that explanation. God and spirituality are not \ntestable hypotheses. Churches are ﬁ  lled with drunks who continue \ndrinking despite a pious faith. In conversations with addicts, though, spirituality kept coming up again and again. So in 2005, a group of  scientists— this time afﬁ  liated with UC Berkeley, Brown University, \nand the National Institutes of  Health— began asking alcoholics about all kinds of religious and spiritual topics. Then they looked at the data to see if there was any correlation between religious belief and how long people stayed sober.\nA pattern emerged",

I was in a really bad place by then. A friend was teaching me to use coke, and every after-noon I would do a line inside my ofﬁ  ce, and ﬁ  ve minutes later I \nwould get that little drip into the back of my throat and do another line.\n“ Anyways, it was my turn to get the kids. I was on the way to their \nschool and I felt totally ﬁ  ne, like I was on top of everything, and I \npulled into an intersection when the light was red and this huge truck slammed into my car. It actually ﬂ  ipped the car on its side. I \ndidn ’t have a scratch on me. I got out, and started trying to push my car over, because I ﬁ  gured, if I can make it home and leave before \nthe cops arrive, I’ll be ﬁ  ne. Of course that didn ’t work out, and when \nthey arrested me for DUI they showed me how the passenger side of the car was completely crushed in. That’s where Sammy usually sat. If he had been there, he would have been killed.\n“So I started going to meetings again, and my sponsor told me \nthat it didn ’t matter if I felt in control. Without a higher power in my life, without admitting my powerlessness, none of it was going to work. I thought that was  bull— I’m an atheist. But I knew that if something didn ’t change, I was going to kill my kids. So I started working at that, working at believing in something bigger than me. And it’s working. I don ’t know if it’s God or something else, but there is a power that has helped me stay sober for seven years now and I’m in awe of it. I don ’t wake up sober every  morning— I mean, I haven ’t had a drink in seven",

    "text": " was on top of everything, and I \npulled into an intersection when the light was red and this huge truck slammed into my car. It actually ﬂ  ipped the car on its side. I \ndidn ’t have a scratch on me. I got out, and started trying to push my car over, because I ﬁ  gured, if I can make it home and leave before \nthe cops arrive, I’ll be ﬁ  ne. Of course that didn ’t work out, and when \nthey arrested me for DUI they showed me how the passenger side of the car was completely crushed in. That’s where Sammy usually sat. If he had been there, he would have been killed.\n“So I started going to meetings again, and my sponsor told me \nthat it didn ’t matter if I felt in control. Without a higher power in my life, without admitting my powerlessness, none of it was going to work. I thought that was  bull— I’m an atheist. But I knew that if something didn ’t change, I was going to kill my kids. So I started working at that, working at believing in something bigger than me. And it’s working. I don ’t know if it’s God",

I don ’t wake up sober every  morning— I mean, I haven ’t had a drink in seven years, but some mornings I wake up feeling like I’m gonna fall down that day. Those days, I look for the higher power, and I call my sponsor, and most of the time we don ’t talk about drinking. We talk about life and marriage and my job, and by the time I’m ready for a shower, my head is on straight.”\nThe ﬁ  rst cracks in the theory that Alcoholics Anonymous suc-\nceeded solely by reprogramming participants’ habits started appear-ing a little over a decade ago and were caused by stories from \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   83 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   83 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n84 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nalcoholics like John. Researchers began ﬁ  nding that habit replace-\nment worked pretty well for many people until the stresses of  life— such as ﬁ  nding out your mom has cancer, or your marriage is \ncoming  apart— got too high, at which point alcoholics often fell off the wagon. Academics asked why, if habit replacement is so effec-tive, it seemed to fail at such critical moments. And as they dug into alcoholics’ stories to answer that question, they learned that replace-ment habits only become durable new behaviors when they are accompanied by something else.\nOne group of researchers at the Alcohol Research Group in Cali-\nfornia, for instance, noticed a pattern in interviews. Over and over again, alcoholics said the same thing: Identifying cues and choosing new routines is important, but without another ingredient, the new habits never fully took hold.\nThe secret, the alcoholics said, was God.Researchers hated that explanation. God and spirituality are not \ntestable hypotheses. Churches are ﬁ  lled with drunks who continue \ndrinking despite a pious faith. In conversations with addicts, though, spirituality kept coming up again and again. So in 2005, a group of  scientists— this time afﬁ  liated with UC Berkeley, Brown",

    "text": " University, \nand the National Institutes of  Health— began asking alcoholics about all kinds of religious and spiritual topics. Then they looked at the data to see if there was any correlation between religious belief and how long people stayed sober.\nA pattern emerged. Alcoholics who practiced the techniques of \nhabit replacement, the data indicated, could often stay sober until there was a stressful event in their  lives— at which point, a certain number started drinking again, no matter how many new routines they had embraced.\nHowever, those alcoholics who believed, like John in Brooklyn, \nthat some higher power had entered their lives were more likely to make it through the stressful periods with their sobriety intact.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   84 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   84 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Golden Rule of Habit Change ● 85\nIt wasn ’t God that mattered, the researchers ﬁ  gured out. It was \nbelief itself that made a difference. Once people learned how to be-lieve in something, that skill started spilling over to other parts of their lives, until they started believing they could change. Belief was the ingredient that made a reworked habit loop into a permanent behavior.\n“I wouldn ’t have said this a year  ago— that’s how fast our under-\nstanding is changing,” said Tonigan, the University of New Mexico researcher, “but belief seems critical. You don ’t have to believe in God, but you do need the capacity to believe that things will get bet-ter.\n“Even if you give people better habits, it doesn ’t repair why they \nstarted drinking in the ﬁ  rst place. Eventually they’ll have a bad day, \nand no new routine is going to make everything seem okay. What can make a difference is believing that they can cope with that stress \nwithout alcohol.”\nBy putting alcoholics in meetings where belief is a  given— where, \nin fact, belief is an integral part of the twelve  steps— AA trains peo-ple in how to believe in something until they believe in the program and themselves. It lets people practice believing that things will eventually get better, until things actually do.\n“ At some point, people in AA look around the room and think, if \nit worked for that guy, I guess it can work for me ,” said Lee Ann Kasku-\ntas, a senior scientist at the Alcohol Research Group. “There’s some-thing really powerful about groups and shared experiences. People might be skeptical about their ability to change if they’re by them-selves, but a group will convince them to suspend disbelief. A com-munity creates belief.”\nAs John was leaving the AA meeting, I asked him why the pro-\ngram worked now, after it had failed him before. “When I started coming to meetings after the truck accident, someone asked for vol-unteers to help put away the chairs,” he told me. “I raised my hand. \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   85 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   85 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n86 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nIt wasn ’t a big thing, it took like ﬁ  ve minutes, but it felt good to do \nsomething that wasn ’t all about me. I think that started me on a dif-\nferent path.\n“I wasn ’t ready to give in to the group the ﬁ  rst time, but when I \ncame back, I was ready to start believing in something.”\nV.\nWithin a week of Dungy’s ﬁ  ring by the Bucs, the owner of the In-\ndianapolis Colts left an impassioned  ﬁ  fteen- minute message on his \nanswering machine. The Colts, despite having one of the NFL ’s best quarterbacks, Peyton Manning, had just ﬁ  nished a dreadful season. \nThe owner needed help. He was tired of losing, he said. Dungy moved to Indianapolis and became head coach.\nHe immediately started implementing the same basic game \nplan: remaking the Colts’ routines and teaching players to use old cues to build reworked habits. In his ﬁ  rst season, the Colts went \n10–6 and qualiﬁ  ed for the  play- offs. The next season, they went 12–4 \nand came within one game of the Super Bowl. Dungy’s celebrity grew. Newspaper and television proﬁ  les appeared around the coun-\ntry. Fans ﬂ  ew in so they could visit the church",

    "text": " University, \nand the National Institutes of  Health— began asking alcoholics about all kinds of religious and spiritual topics. Then they looked at the data to see if there was any correlation between religious belief and how long people stayed sober.\nA pattern emerged. Alcoholics who practiced the techniques of \nhabit replacement, the data indicated, could often stay sober until there was a stressful event in their  lives— at which point, a certain number started drinking again, no matter how many new routines they had embraced.\nHowever, those alcoholics who believed, like John in Brooklyn, \nthat some higher power had entered their lives were more likely to make it through the stressful periods with their sobriety intact.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   84 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   84 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Golden Rule of Habit Change ● 85\nIt wasn ’t God that mattered, the researchers ﬁ  gured out. It was \nbelief itself that made a difference. Once people learned how to be-lieve in something, that skill started spilling over to other parts of their lives, until they started believing they could change. Belief was the ingredient that made a reworked habit loop into a permanent behavior.\n“I wouldn ’t have said this a year  ago— that’s how fast our under-\nstanding is changing,” said Tonigan, the University of New Mexico researcher, “but belief seems critical. You don ’t have to believe in God, but you do need the capacity to believe that things will get bet-ter.\n“Even if you give people better habits, it doesn ’t repair why they \nstarted drinking in the ﬁ  rst place. Eventually they’ll have a bad day, \nand no new routine is going to make everything seem okay. What can make a difference is believing that they can cope with that stress \nwithout alcohol.”\nBy putting alcoholics in meetings where belief is a  given— where, \nin fact, belief is an integral part of the twelve  steps— AA trains peo-ple in how to believe in something until they believe in the program and themselves. It lets people practice believing that things will eventually get better, until things actually do.\n“ At some point, people in AA look around the room and think, if \nit worked for",

Fans ﬂ  ew in so they could visit the church Dungy attended. His \nsons became ﬁ  xtures in the Colts’ locker room and on the sidelines. \nIn 2005, Jamie, his eldest boy, graduated from high school and went to college in Florida.\nEven as Dungy’s successes mounted, however, the same trou-\nbling patterns emerged. The Colts would play a season of disci-plined, winning football, and then under  play- off pressure, choke.\n“Belief is the biggest part of success in professional football,” \nDungy told me. “The team wanted to believe, but when things got \nreally tense, they went back to their comfort zones and old habits.”\nThe Colts ﬁ  nished the 2005 regular season with fourteen wins \nand two losses, the best record in its history.\nThen tragedy struck.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   86 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   86 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Golden Rule of Habit Change ● 87\nThree days before Christmas, Tony Dungy’s phone rang in the \nmiddle of the night. His wife answered and handed him the re-ceiver, thinking it was one of his players. There was a nurse on the line. Dungy’s son Jamie had been brought into the hospital earlier in the evening, she said, with compression injuries on his throat. His girlfriend had found him hanging in his apartment, a belt around his neck. Paramedics had rushed him to the hospital, but efforts at revival were unsuccessful. He was gone.\nA chaplain ﬂ  ew to spend Christmas with the family. “Life will \nnever be the same again,” the chaplain told them, “but you won ’t always feel like you do right now.”\nA few days after the funeral, Dungy returned to the sidelines. He \nneeded something to distract himself, and his wife and team en-couraged him to go back to work. “I was overwhelmed by their love and support,” he later wrote. “ As a group, we had always leaned on each other in difﬁ  cult times; I needed them now more than ever.”\nThe team lost their ﬁ  rst  play- off game, concluding their season. \nBut in the aftermath of watching Dungy during this tragedy, “some-thing changed,” one of his players from that period told me. “We had seen Coach through this terrible thing and all of us wanted to help him somehow.”\nIt is simplistic, even cavalier, to suggest that a young man ’s death \ncan have an impact on football games. Dungy has always said that nothing is more important to him than his family. But in the wake of Jamie’s passing, as the Colts started preparing for the next sea-son, something shifted, his players say. The team gave in to Dungy’s vision of how football should be played in a way they hadn ’t before. They started to believe.\n“I had spent a lot of previous seasons worrying about my con-\ntract and salary,” said one player who, like others, spoke about that period on the condition of anonymity. “When Coach came back, after the funeral, I wanted to give him everything I could, to take away his hurt. I kind of gave myself to the team.”\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   87 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   87 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n88 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\n“Some men like hugging each other,” another player told me. “I \ndon ’t. I haven ’t hugged my sons in a decade. But after Coach came back, I walked over and I hugged him as long as I could, because I wanted him to know that I was there for him.”\nAfter the death of Dungy’s son, the team started playing differ-\nently. A conviction emerged among players about the strength of Dungy’s strategy. In practices and scrimmages leading up to the start of the 2006 season, the Colts played tight, precise football.\n“Most football teams aren ’t really teams. They’re just guys who \nwork together,” a third player from that period told me. “But we be-came a team . It felt amazing. Coach was the spark, but it was about \nmore than him. After he came",

He \nneeded something to distract himself, and his wife and team en-couraged him to go back to work. “I was overwhelmed by their love and support,” he later wrote. “ As a group, we had always leaned on each other in difﬁ  cult times; I needed them now more than ever.”\nThe team lost their ﬁ  rst  play- off game, concluding their season. \nBut in the aftermath of watching Dungy during this tragedy, “some-thing changed,” one of his players from that period told me. “We had seen Coach through this terrible thing and all of us wanted to help him somehow.”\nIt is simplistic, even cavalier, to suggest that a young man ’s death \ncan have an impact on football games. Dungy has always said that nothing is more important to him than his family. But in the wake of Jamie’s passing, as the Colts started preparing for the next sea-son, something shifted, his players say. The team gave in to Dungy’s vision of how football should be played in a way they hadn ’t before. They started to believe.\n“I had spent a lot of previous seasons worrying about my con-\ntract and salary,” said one player who, like others, spoke about that period on the condition of anonymity. “When Coach came back, after the funeral, I wanted to give him everything I could, to take away his hurt.

I haven ’t hugged my sons in a decade. But after Coach came back, I walked over and I hugged him as long as I could, because I wanted him to know that I was there for him.”\nAfter the death of Dungy’s son, the team started playing differ-\nently. A conviction emerged among players about the strength of Dungy’s strategy. In practices and scrimmages leading up to the start of the 2006 season, the Colts played tight, precise football.\n“Most football teams aren ’t really",

    "text": " teams. They’re just guys who \nwork together,” a third player from that period told me. “But we be-came a team . It felt amazing. Coach was the spark, but it was about \nmore than him. After he came back, it felt like we really believed in each other, like we knew how to play together in a way we didn ’t before.”\nFor the Colts, a belief in their  team— in Dungy’s tactics and their \nability to  win— began to emerge out of tragedy. But just as often, a similar belief can emerge without any kind of adversity.\nIn a 1994 Harvard study that examined people who had radically \nchanged their lives, for instance, researchers found that some peo-ple had remade their habits after a personal tragedy, such as a di-vorce or a  life- threatening illness. Others changed after they saw a friend go through something awful, the same way that Dungy’s players watched him struggle.\nJust as frequently, however, there was no tragedy that preceded \npeople’s transformations. Rather, they changed because they were embedded in social groups that made change easier. One woman said her entire life shifted when she signed up for a psychology class and met a wonderful group. “It opened a Pandora’s box,” the woman told researchers. “I could not tolerate the status quo any longer. I had changed in my core.” Another man said that he found new friends among whom he could practice being gregarious. “When I do make the effort to overcome my shyness, I feel that it is not really me acting, that it’s someone else,” he said. But by practicing with \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   88 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   88 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Golden Rule of Habit Change ● 89\nhis new group, it stopped feeling like acting. He started to believe he \nwasn ’t shy, and then, eventually, he wasn ’t anymore. When people join groups where change seems possible, the potential for that change to occur becomes more real. For most people who overhaul their lives, there are no seminal moments or  life- altering disasters. There are simply  communities— sometimes of just one other  person— who make change believable. One woman told researchers her life transformed after a day spent cleaning  toilets— and after weeks of discussing with the rest of the cleaning crew whether she should leave her husband.\n“Change occurs among other people,” one of the psychologists \ninvolved in the study, Todd Heatherton, told me. “It seems real when we can see it in other people’s eyes.”\nThe precise mechanisms of belief are still little understood. No \none is certain why a group encountered in a psychology class can convince a woman that everything is different, or why Dungy’s team came together after their coach ’s son passed away. Plenty of people talk to friends about unhappy marriages and never leave their spouses; lots of teams watch their coaches experience adversity and never gel.\nBut we do know that for habits to permanently change, people \nmust believe that change is feasible. The same process that makes AA so  effective— the power of a group to teach individuals how to  believe— happens whenever people come together to help one an-other change. Belief is easier when it occurs within a community.\n● ● ●\nTen months after Jamie’s death, the 2006 football season began. The Colts played peerless football, winning their ﬁ  rst nine games, \nand ﬁ  nishing the year 12–4. They won their ﬁ  rst  play- off game, and \nthen beat the Baltimore Ravens for the divisional title. At that point, they were one step away from the Super Bowl, playing for the con-\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   89 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   89 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n90 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nference  championship— the game that Dungy had lost eight times \nbefore.\nThe matchup occurred on January 21, 2007, against the New \nEngland Patriots, the same team that had snuffed out the Colts’ Super Bowl aspirations twice.\nThe Colts started the game strong, but before the ﬁ  rst half ended, \nthey began falling apart. Players were afraid of making mistakes or so eager to get past the ﬁ  nal Super Bowl hurdle that they lost track \nof where they were supposed to be focusing. They stopped relying on their habits and started thinking too much. Sloppy tackling led to turnovers",

    "text": " teams. They’re just guys who \nwork together,” a third player from that period told me. “But we be-came a team . It felt amazing. Coach was the spark, but it was about \nmore than him. After he came back, it felt like we really believed in each other, like we knew how to play together in a way we didn ’t before.”\nFor the Colts, a belief in their  team— in Dungy’s tactics and their \nability to  win— began to emerge out of tragedy. But just as often, a similar belief can emerge without any kind of adversity.\nIn a 1994 Harvard study that examined people who had radically \nchanged their lives, for instance, researchers found that some peo-ple had remade their habits after a personal tragedy, such as a di-vorce or a  life- threatening illness. Others changed after they saw a friend go through something awful, the same way that Dungy’s players watched him struggle.\nJust as frequently, however, there was no tragedy that preceded \npeople’s transformations. Rather, they changed because they were embedded in social groups that made change easier. One woman said her entire life shifted when she signed up for a psychology class and met a wonderful group. “It opened a Pandora’s box,” the woman told researchers. “I could not tolerate the status quo any longer. I had changed in my core.” Another man said that he found new friends among whom he could practice being gregarious. “When I do make the effort to overcome my shyness, I feel that it is not really me acting, that it’s someone else,” he said. But by practicing with \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   88 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   88 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Golden Rule of Habit Change ● 89\nhis new group, it stopped feeling like acting. He started to believe he \nwasn ’t shy, and then, eventually, he wasn ’t anymore. When people join groups where change seems possible, the potential for that change to occur becomes more real. For most people who overhaul their lives, there are no seminal moments or  life- altering disasters. There are simply  communities— sometimes of just one other  person— who make change believable.",

There are simply  communities— sometimes of just one other  person— who make change believable. One woman told researchers her life transformed after a day spent cleaning  toilets— and after weeks of discussing with the rest of the cleaning crew whether she should leave her husband.\n“Change occurs among other people,” one of the psychologists \ninvolved in the study, Todd Heatherton, told me. “It seems real when we can see it in other people’s eyes.”\nThe precise mechanisms of belief are still little understood. No \none is certain why a group encountered in a psychology class can convince a woman that everything is different, or why Dungy’s team came together after their coach ’s son passed away. Plenty of people talk to friends about unhappy marriages and never leave their spouses; lots of teams watch their coaches experience adversity and never gel.\nBut we do know that for habits to permanently change, people \nmust believe that change is feasible. The same process that makes AA so  effective— the power of a group to teach individuals how to  believe— happens whenever people come together to help one an-other change. Belief is easier when it occurs within a community.\n● ● ●\nTen months after Jamie’s death, the 2006 football season began.

    "text": " the potential for that change to occur becomes more real. For most people who overhaul their lives, there are no seminal moments or  life- altering disasters. There are simply  communities— sometimes of just one other  person— who make change believable. One woman told researchers her life transformed after a day spent cleaning  toilets— and after weeks of discussing with the rest of the cleaning crew whether she should leave her husband.\n“Change occurs among other people,” one of the psychologists \ninvolved in the study, Todd Heatherton, told me. “It seems real when we can see it in other people’s eyes.”\nThe precise mechanisms of belief are still little understood. No \none is certain why a group encountered in a psychology class can convince a woman that everything is different, or why Dungy’s team came together after their coach ’s son passed away. Plenty of people talk to friends about unhappy marriages and never leave their spouses; lots of teams watch their coaches experience adversity and never gel.\nBut we do know that for habits to permanently change, people \nmust believe that change is feasible. The same process that makes AA so  effective— the power of a group to teach individuals how to  believe— happens whenever people come together to help one an-other change.",

They stopped relying on their habits and started thinking too much. Sloppy tackling led to turnovers. One of Peyton Manning’s passes was intercepted and re-turned for a touchdown. Their opponents, the Patriots, pulled ahead 21 to 3. No team in the history of the NFL had ever overcome so big a deﬁ  cit in a conference championship. Dungy’s team, once again, \nwas going to lose.\nAt halftime, the team ﬁ  led into the locker room, and Dungy \nasked everyone to gather around. The noise from the stadium ﬁ  l-\ntered through the closed doors, but inside everyone was quiet. Dungy looked at his players.\nThey had to believe, he said.“We faced this same  situation— against this same  team— in \n2003,” Dungy told them. In that game, they had come within one yard of winning. One yard. “Get your sword ready because this time we’re going to win. This is our game. It’s our time.”\nThe Colts came out in the second half and started playing as they \nhad in every preceding game. They stayed focused on their cues and habits. They carefully executed the plays they had spent the past ﬁ  ve \nyears practicing until they had become automatic. Their offense, on the opening drive, ground out  seventy- six yards over fourteen plays and scored a touchdown. Then, three minutes after taking the next possession, they scored again.\nAs the fourth quarter wound down, the teams traded points. The \nColts tied the game, but never managed to pull ahead. With 3:49 left \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   90 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   90 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Golden Rule of Habit Change ● 91\nin the game, the Patriots scored, putting Dungy’s players at a \n three- point disadvantage, 34 to 31. The Colts got the ball and began driving down the ﬁ  eld. They moved seventy yards in nineteen sec-\nonds, and crossed into the end zone. For the ﬁ  rst time, the Colts had \nthe lead, 38 to 34. There were now sixty seconds left on the clock. If Dungy’s team could stop the Patriots from scoring a touchdown, the Colts would win.\nSixty seconds is an eternity in football.The Patriots’ quarterback, Tom Brady, had scored touchdowns in \nfar less time. Sure enough, within seconds of the start of play, Brady moved his team halfway down the ﬁ  eld. With seventeen seconds \nremaining, the Patriots were within striking distance, poised for a ﬁ nal big play that would hand Dungy another defeat and crush, yet \nagain, his team ’s Super Bowl dreams.\nAs the Patriots approached the line of scrimmage, the Colts’ de-\nfense went into their stances. Marlin Jackson, a Colts cornerback, stood ten yards back from the line. He looked at his cues: the width of the gaps between the Patriot linemen and the depth of the run-ning back’s stance. Both told him this was going to be a passing play. Tom Brady, the Patriots’ quarterback, took the snap and dropped back to pass. Jackson was already moving. Brady cocked his arm and heaved the ball. His intended target was a Patriot receiver  twenty- two yards away, wide open, near the middle of the ﬁ  eld. If the receiver \ncaught the ball, it was likely he could make it close to the end zone or score a touchdown. The football ﬂ  ew through the air. Jackson, the \nColts cornerback, was already running at an angle, following his habits. He rushed past the receiver’s right shoulder, cutting in front of him just as the ball arrived. Jackson plucked the ball out of the air for an interception, ran a few more steps and then slid to the ground, hugging the ball to his chest. The whole play had taken less than ﬁ  ve \nseconds. The game was over. Dungy and the Colts had won.\nTwo weeks later, they won the Super Bowl. There are dozens of \nreasons that might explain why the Colts ﬁ  nally became champions \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   91 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   91 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n92 ● THE",

    "text": " three- point disadvantage, 34 to 31. The Colts got the ball and began driving down the ﬁ  eld. They moved seventy yards in nineteen sec-\nonds, and crossed into the end zone. For the ﬁ  rst time, the Colts had \nthe lead, 38 to 34. There were now sixty seconds left on the clock. If Dungy’s team could stop the Patriots from scoring a touchdown, the Colts would win.\nSixty seconds is an eternity in football.The Patriots’ quarterback, Tom Brady, had scored touchdowns in \nfar less time. Sure enough, within seconds of the start of play, Brady moved his team halfway down the ﬁ  eld. With seventeen seconds \nremaining, the Patriots were within striking distance, poised for a ﬁ nal big play that would hand Dungy another defeat and crush, yet \nagain, his team ’s Super Bowl dreams.\nAs the Patriots approached the line of scrimmage, the Colts’ de-\nfense went into their stances. Marlin Jackson, a Colts cornerback, stood ten yards back from the line. He looked at his cues: the width of the gaps between the Patriot linemen and the depth of the run-ning back’s stance. Both told him this was going to be a passing play. Tom Brady, the Patriots’ quarterback, took the snap and dropped back to pass. Jackson was already moving. Brady cocked his arm and heaved the ball. His intended target was a Patriot receiver  twenty- two yards away, wide open, near the middle of the ﬁ  eld. If the receiver \ncaught the ball, it was likely he could make it close to the end zone or score a touchdown. The football ﬂ  ew through the air. Jackson, the \nColts cornerback, was already running at an angle, following his habits. He rushed past the receiver’s right shoulder, cutting in front of him just as the ball arrived. Jackson plucked the ball out of the air for an interception, ran a few more steps and then slid to the ground, hugging the ball to his chest. The whole play had taken less than ﬁ  ve \nseconds. The game was over. Dungy and the Colts had won.\nTwo weeks later, they won the Super Bowl. There are dozens of \nreasons that might explain why the Colts ﬁ  nally became champions \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd  ",

But \nDungy’s players say it’s because they believed,  and because that be-\nlief made everything they had  learned— all the routines they had practiced until they became  automatic— stick, even at the most stressful moments.\n“We’re proud to have won this championship for our leader, \nCoach Dungy,” Peyton Manning told the crowd afterward, cradling the Lombardi Trophy.\nDungy turned to his wife. “We did it,” he said.\n● ● ●\nHow do habits change?\nThere is, unfortunately, no speciﬁ  c set of steps guaranteed to \nwork for every person. We know that a habit cannot be  eradicated— it must, instead, be replaced. And we know that habits are most mal-leable when the Golden Rule of habit change is applied: If we keep the same cue and the same reward, a new routine can be inserted.\nBut that’s not enough. For a habit to stay changed, people must \nbelieve change is possible. And most often, that belief only emerges with the help of a group.\nIf you want to quit smoking, ﬁ  gure out a different routine that \nwill satisfy the cravings ﬁ  lled by cigarettes. Then, ﬁ  nd a support \ngroup, a collection of other former smokers, or a community that will help you believe you can stay away from nicotine, and use that group when you feel you might stumble.\nIf you want to lose weight, study your habits to determine why \nyou really leave your desk for a snack each day, and then ﬁ  nd some-\none else to take a walk with you, to gossip with at their desk rather than in the cafeteria, a group that tracks  weight- loss goals together, or someone who also wants to keep a stock of apples, rather than chips, nearby.\nThe evidence is clear: If you want to change a habit, you must \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   92 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   92 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Golden Rule of Habit Change ● 93\nﬁ nd an alternative routine, and your odds of success go up dramati-\ncally when you commit to changing as part of a group. Belief is es-sential, and it grows out of a communal experience, even if that community is only as large as two people.\nWe know that change can happen. Alcoholics can stop drinking. \nSmokers can quit pufﬁ  ng. Perennial losers can become champions. \nYou can stop biting your nails or snacking at work, yelling at your kids, staying up all night, or worrying over small concerns. And as scientists have discovered, it’s not just individual lives that can shift when habits are tended to. It’s also companies, organizations, and communities, as the next chapters explain.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   93 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   93 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM",

But \nDungy’s players say it’s because they believed,  and because that be-\nlief made everything they had  learned— all the routines they had practiced until they became  automatic— stick, even at the most stressful moments.\n“We’re proud to have won this championship for our leader, \nCoach Dungy,” Peyton Manning told the crowd afterward, cradling the Lombardi Trophy.\nDungy turned to his wife. “We did it,” he said.\n● ● ●\nHow do habits change?\nThere is, unfortunately, no speciﬁ  c set of steps guaranteed to \nwork for every person.

And we know that habits are most mal-leable when the Golden Rule of habit change is applied: If we keep the same cue and the same reward, a new routine can be inserted.\nBut that’s not enough. For a habit to stay changed, people must \nbelieve change is possible. And most often, that belief only emerges with the help of a group.\nIf you want to quit smoking, ﬁ  gure out a different routine that \nwill satisfy the cravings ﬁ  lled by cigarettes. Then, ﬁ  nd a support \ngroup, a collection of other former smokers, or a community that will help you believe you can stay away from nicotine, and use that group when you feel you might stumble.\nIf you want to lose weight, study your habits to determine why \nyou really leave your desk for a snack each day, and then ﬁ  nd some-\none else to take a walk with you, to gossip with at their desk rather than in the cafeteria, a group that tracks  weight- loss goals together, or someone who also wants to keep a stock of apples, rather than chips, nearby.\nThe evidence is clear: If you want to",

Belief is es-sential, and it grows out of a communal experience, even if that community is only as large as two people.\nWe know that change can happen.

Perennial losers can become champions. \nYou can stop biting your nails or snacking at work, yelling at your kids, staying up all night, or worrying over small concerns. And as scientists have discovered, it’s not just individual lives that can shift when habits are tended to. It’s also companies, organizations, and communities, as the next chapters explain.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd  ",
