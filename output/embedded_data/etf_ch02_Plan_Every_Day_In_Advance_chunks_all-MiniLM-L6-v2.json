The same way; you break\nit down into specific step-by-step activities and then you start on thefirst one.\nYour mind, your ability to think, plan and decide, is your most\npowerful tool for overcoming procrastination and increasing yourproductivity. Your ability to set your goals, make plans and take\naction on them determines the course of your life. The very act of\nthinking and planning unlocks your mental powers, triggers your\ncreativity and increases your mental and physical energies.\nConversely, as Alex Mackenzie wrote, \"Action without planning is the\ncause of every failure.\"\nYour ability to make good plans, before you begin, is a measure of\nyour overall competence. The better the plan you have, the easier it is\nfor you to overcome procrastination, to get started, to eat your frog\nand then to keep going.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 23Increase Your Return on Energy\nOne of your top goals at work should be for you to get the highest\npossible return on your investment of mental, emotional and physicalenergy. The good news is that every minute spent in planning savesas many as ten minutes in execution. It only takes about ten to twelve\nminutes for you to plan out your day, but this small investment of\ntime will save you at least two hours (100-120 minutes) in wastedtime and diffused effort throughout the day.\nYou may have heard of the Six \"P\" Formula. It says, \"Proper Prior\nPlanning Prevents Poor Performance.\"\nWhen you consider how helpful planning can be in increasing your\nproductivity and performance, it is amazing how few people practice\nit every single day. And planning is really quite simple to do. All youneed is a piece of paper and a pen. The most sophisticated Palm Pilot,\ncomputer program or time planner is based on the same principle. It\nis based on your sitting down and making a list of everything you\nhave to do before you begin.\nTwo Extra Hours Per Day\nAlways work from a list. When something new comes up, add it to\nthe list before you do it. You can increase your productivity and\noutput by 25% or more, by about two hours, from the first day that\nyou begin working consistently from a list.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 24Make out your list the night before, at the end of the workday. Move\neverything that you have not yet accomplished onto your list for the\ncoming day and then add everything that you have to do the next\nday. When you make out your list the evening or the night before,your subconscious mind works on your list all night long while yousleep. Often you will wake up with great ideas and insights that you\ncan use to get your job done faster and better than you had initially\nthought.\nThe more time you take to make written lists of everything you have\nto do, in advance, the more effective and efficient you will be.\nDifferent Lists for Different Purposes\nThere are different lists that you need for different purposes. First,\nyou should create a master list  on which you write down everything\nyou can think of that you want to do some time in the future. This is\nthe place where you capture every idea that comes to or every new\ntask or responsibility that comes up.  You can then sort out the items\nlater.\nSecond, you should have a monthly list that you make up at the end\nof the month for the month ahead.  This may contain items\ntransferred from your master list.\nThird, you should have a weekly list where you plan your entire\nweek in advance. This is a list that is under construction as you go\nthrough the current week.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 25This discipline of systematic time planning can be very helpful to\nyou. Many people have told me that the habit of taking a couple of\nhours at the end of each week to plan the coming week has increased\ntheir productivity dramatically and changed their lives completely.This technique will work for you as well.\nFinally, you transfer items from your monthly and weekly lists onto\nyour daily list. These are the specific activities that you are going toaccomplish that day.\nAs you work through the day, tick off the items on your list as you\ncomplete them. This activity gives you a visual picture ofaccomplishment. It generates a feeling of success and forward\nmotion.  Seeing yourself working progressively through your list\nmotivates and energizes you. It raises your self-esteem and self-\nrespect. Steady, visible",

The same way; you break\nit down into specific step-by-step activities and then you start on thefirst one.\nYour mind, your ability to think, plan and decide, is your most\npowerful tool for overcoming procrastination and increasing yourproductivity. Your ability to set your goals, make plans and take\naction on them determines the course of your life. The very act of\nthinking and planning unlocks your mental powers, triggers your\ncreativity and increases your mental and physical energies.\nConversely, as Alex Mackenzie wrote, \"Action without planning is the\ncause of every failure.\"\nYour ability to make good plans, before you begin, is a measure of\nyour overall competence. The better the plan you have, the easier it is\nfor you to overcome procrastination, to get started, to eat your frog\nand then to keep going.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 23Increase Your Return on Energy\nOne of your top goals at work should be for you to get the highest\npossible return on your investment of mental, emotional and physicalenergy. The good news is that every minute spent in planning savesas many as ten minutes in execution. It only takes about ten to twelve\nminutes for you to plan out your day, but this small investment of\ntime will save you at least two hours (100-120 minutes) in wastedtime and diffused effort throughout the day.\nYou may have heard of the Six \"P\" Formula. It says, \"Proper Prior\nPlanning Prevents Poor Performance.\"\nWhen you consider how helpful planning can be in increasing your\nproductivity and performance, it is amazing how few people practice\nit every single day. And planning is really quite simple to do. All youneed is a piece of paper and a pen. The most sophisticated Palm Pilot,\ncomputer program or time planner is based on the same principle. It\nis based on your sitting down and making a list of everything you\nhave to do before you begin.\nTwo Extra Hours Per Day\nAlways work from a list. When something new comes up, add it to\nthe list before you do",

    "text": "EAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 22CHAPTER 2\nPlan Every Day In Advance\n“Planning is bringing the future into the present\nso you can do something about it now.”\nAlan Lakein\nYou have heard the old question, ”How do you eat an elephant?\nAnswer: One bite at a time!”\nHow do you eat your biggest, ugliest frog? The same way; you break\nit down into specific step-by-step activities and then you start on thefirst one.\nYour mind, your ability to think, plan and decide, is your most\npowerful tool for overcoming procrastination and increasing yourproductivity. Your ability to set your goals, make plans and take\naction on them determines the course of your life. The very act of\nthinking and planning unlocks your mental powers, triggers your\ncreativity and increases your mental and physical energies.\nConversely, as Alex Mackenzie wrote, \"Action without planning is the\ncause of every failure.\"\nYour ability to make good plans, before you begin, is a measure of\nyour overall competence. The better the plan you have, the easier it is\nfor you to overcome procrastination, to get started, to eat your frog\nand then to keep going.\nE",

The better the plan you have, the easier it is\nfor you to overcome procrastination, to get started, to eat your frog\nand then to keep going.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 23Increase Your Return on Energy\nOne of your top goals at work should be for you to get the highest\npossible return on your investment of mental, emotional and physicalenergy. The good news is that every minute spent in planning savesas many as ten minutes in execution. It only takes about ten to twelve\nminutes for you to plan out your day, but this small investment of\ntime will save you at least two hours (100-120 minutes) in wastedtime and diffused effort throughout the day.\nYou may have heard of the Six \"P\" Formula. It says, \"Proper Prior\nPlanning Prevents Poor Performance.\"\nWhen you consider how helpful planning can be in increasing your\nproductivity and performance, it is amazing how few people practice\nit every single day. And planning is really quite simple to do. All youneed is a piece of paper and a pen. The most sophisticated Palm Pilot,\ncomputer program or time planner is based on the same principle.",

When something new comes up, add it to\nthe list before you do it. You can increase your productivity and\noutput by 25% or more, by about two hours, from the first day that\nyou begin working consistently from a list.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 24Make out your list the night before, at the end of the workday. Move\neverything that you have not yet accomplished onto your list for the\ncoming day and then add everything that you have to do the next\nday. When you make out your list the evening or the night before,your subconscious mind works on your list all night long while yousleep. Often you will wake up with great ideas and insights that you\ncan use to get your job done faster and better than you had initially\nthought.\nThe more time you take to make written lists of everything you have\nto do, in advance, the more effective and efficient you will be.\nDifferent Lists for Different Purposes\nThere are different lists that you need for different purposes. First,\nyou should create a master list  on which you write down everything\nyou can think of that you want to do some time in the future. This is\nthe place where you capture every idea that comes to or every new\ntask or responsibility that comes up.  You can then sort out the items\nlater.\nSecond, you should have a monthly list that you make up at the end\nof the month for the month ahead.  This may contain items\ntransferred from your master list.\nThird, you should have a weekly list where you plan your entire\nweek in advance. This is a list that is under construction as you go\nthrough the current week.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 25This discipline of systematic time planning can be very helpful to\nyou. Many people have told me that the habit of taking a couple of\nhours at the end of each week to plan the coming week has increased\ntheir productivity dramatically and changed their lives completely.This technique will work for you as well.\nFinally, you transfer items from your monthly and weekly lists onto\nyour daily list. These are the specific activities that you are going toaccomplish that day.\nAs you work through the day, tick off the items on your list as you\ncomplete them. This activity gives you",

Move\neverything that you have not yet accomplished onto your list for the\ncoming day and then add everything that you have to do the next\nday. When you make out your list the evening or the night before,your subconscious mind works on your list all night long while yousleep. Often you will wake up with great ideas and insights that you\ncan use to get your job done faster and better than you had initially\nthought.\nThe more time you take to make written lists of everything you have\nto do, in advance, the more effective and efficient you will be.\nDifferent Lists for Different Purposes\nThere are different lists that you need for different purposes.

It raises your self-esteem and self-\nrespect. Steady, visible progress propels you forward and helps youto overcome procrastination.\nPlanning a Project\nWhen you have a project of any kind, begin by making a list of every\nstep that you will have to complete to finish the project from\nbeginning to end. Organize the project by priority and sequence. Lay\nout the project in front of you on paper, or on a computer so that you\ncan see every step and task. Then go to work on one task at a time.\nYou will be amazed at how much you get done in this way.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 26As you work through your lists, you will feel more and more\neffective and powerful. You will feel more in control of your life. You\nwill be naturally motivated to do even more. You will think better\nand more creatively and you will get more and better insights thatenable you to do your work even faster.\nAs you work steadily through your lists, you will develop a sense of\npositive forward momentum that enables you to overcome\nprocrastination. This feeling of progress gives you more energy and\nkeeps you going throughout the day.\nOne of the most important rules of personal effectiveness is the 10/90\nRule. This rule says that the first 10% of time that you spend\nplanning and organizing your work, before you begin, will save you\nas much as 90% of the time in getting the job done once you get\nstarted. You only have to try this rule once to prove it to yourself.\nWhen you plan each day in advance, you find it much easier to get\ngoing and to keep going. The work goes faster and smoother than ever\nbefore. You feel more powerful and competent. You get more done\nfaster than you thought possible. Eventually, you become unstoppable .\nEat That Frog!\n1.  Begin today to plan every day, week and month in advance. Take\na notepad or sheet of paper, or use your PDA or Blackberry,  and\nmake a list of everything you have to do in the next 24 hours. Add to\nit as new items come up. Make a list of all your projects, the big\nmulti-task jobs that are important to your future.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 272.  Lay out each of your major goals, projects or tasks by priority,\nwhat is most important, and by sequence , what has to be done first,\nwhat comes second and so forth. Start with the end in mind and\nwork backward.\nThink on paper! Always work from a list. You’ll be amazed at how\nmuch more productive you become, and how much easier it is to eat\nyour frog.",

It raises your self-esteem and self-\nrespect. Steady, visible progress propels you forward and helps youto overcome procrastination.\nPlanning a Project\nWhen you have a project of any kind, begin by making a list of every\nstep that you will have to complete to finish the project from\nbeginning to end. Organize the project by priority and sequence. Lay\nout the project in front of you on paper, or on a computer so that you\ncan see every step and task. Then go to work on one task at a time.\nYou will be amazed at how much you get done in this way.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 26As you work through your lists, you will feel more and more\neffective and powerful. You will feel more in control of your life. You\nwill be naturally motivated to do even more. You will think better\nand more creatively and you will get more and better insights thatenable you to do your work even faster.\nAs you work steadily through your lists, you will develop a sense of\npositive forward momentum that enables you to overcome\nprocrastination. This feeling of progress gives you more energy and\nkeeps you going throughout the day.\nOne of the most important rules of personal effectiveness is the 10/90\nRule. This rule says that the first 10% of time that you spend\nplanning and organizing your work, before you begin, will save you\nas much as 90% of the time in getting the job done once you get\nstarted. You only have to try this rule once to prove it to yourself.\nWhen you plan each day in advance, you find it much easier to get\ngoing and to keep going. The work goes faster and smoother than ever\nbefore. You feel more powerful and competent. You get more done\nfaster than you thought possible. Eventually, you become unstoppable .\nEat That Frog!\n1.  Begin today to plan every day, week and month in advance. Take\na notepad or sheet of paper, or use your PDA or Blackberry,  and\nmake a list of everything you have to do in the next 24 hours. Add to\nit as new items come up. Make a list of all your projects, the big\nmulti-task jobs that are important to your",

You will think better\nand more creatively and you will get more and better insights thatenable you to do your work even faster.\nAs you work steadily through your lists, you will develop a sense of\npositive forward momentum that enables you to overcome\nprocrastination. This feeling of progress gives you more energy and\nkeeps you going throughout the day.\nOne of the most important rules of personal effectiveness is the 10/90\nRule. This rule says that the first 10% of time that you spend\nplanning and organizing your work, before you begin, will save you\nas much as 90% of the time in getting the job done once you get\nstarted. You only have to try this rule once to prove it to yourself.\nWhen you plan each day in advance, you find it much easier to get\ngoing and to keep going. The work goes faster and smoother than ever\nbefore. You feel more powerful and competent. You get more done\nfaster than you thought possible. Eventually, you become unstoppable .\nEat That Frog!\n1.  Begin today to plan every day, week and month in advance. Take\na notepad or sheet of paper, or use your PDA or Black",
