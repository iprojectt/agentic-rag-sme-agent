His jaw was slack, his eyes closed, and the top of an intubation tube peeked above his lips. As a nurse hooked him up to a machine that would force air into his lungs during surgery, one of his arms slipped off the gurney, the skin mottled with liver spots.\nThe man was  eighty- six years old and, three days earlier, had \nfallen at home. Afterward, he had trouble staying awake and an-swering questions, and so eventually his wife called an ambulance. In the emergency room, a doctor asked him what happened, but the man kept nodding off in the middle of his sentences. A scan of his head revealed why: The fall had slammed his brain against his skull, causing what’s known as a subdural hematoma. Blood was pooling within the left portion of his cranium, pushing against the delicate folds of tissue inside his skull. The ﬂ  uid had been building for al-\nmost  seventy- two hours, and those parts of the brain that controlled \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   154 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   154 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Power of a Crisis ● 155\nhis breathing and heart were beginning to falter. Unless the blood \nwas drained, the man would die.\nAt the time, Rhode Island Hospital was one of the nation ’s lead-\ning medical institutions, the main teaching hospital for Brown Uni-versity and the only Level I trauma center in southeastern New England. Inside the tall brick and glass building, physicians had pio-neered  cutting- edge medical techniques, including the use of ultra-sound waves to destroy tumors inside a patient’s body. In 2002, the National Coalition on Health Care rated the hospital’s intensive care unit as one of the ﬁ  nest in the country.\nBut by the time the elderly patient arrived, Rhode Island Hospi-\ntal also had another reputation: a place riven by internal tensions. There were deep, simmering enmities between nurses and physi-cians. In 2000, the nurses’ union had voted to strike after com-plaining that they were being forced to work dangerously long hours. More than three hundred of them stood outside the hospi-tal with signs reading “Stop Slavery” and “They can ’t take away our pride.”\n“This place can be awful,” one nurse recalled telling a reporter. \n“The doctors can make you feel like you’re worthless, like you’re disposable. Like you should be thankful to pick up after them.”\nAdministrators eventually agreed to limit nurses’ mandatory \novertime, but tensions continued to rise. A few years later, a surgeon was preparing for a routine abdominal operation when a nurse called for a  “time- out.” Such pauses are standard procedure at most hospitals, a way for doctors and staff to make sure mistakes are avoided. The nursing staff at Rhode Island Hospital was insistent on  time- outs, particularly since a surgeon had accidentally removed the tonsils of a girl who was supposed to have eye surgery.  Time- outs were supposed to catch such errors before they occurred.\nAt the abdominal surgery, when the OR nurse asked the team to \ngather around the patient for a  time- out and to discuss their plan, the doctor headed for the doors.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   155 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   155 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n156 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\n“Why don ’t you lead this?” the surgeon told the nurse. “I’m going \nto step outside for a call. Knock when you’re ready.”\n“You’re supposed to be here for this, Doctor,” she replied.“You can handle it,” the surgeon said, as he walked toward the \ndoor.\n“Doctor, I don ’t feel this is appropriate.”The doctor stopped and looked at her. “If I want your damn opin-\nion, I’ll ask for it,” he said. “Don ’t ever question my authority again. If you can ’t do your job, get the hell out of my OR.”\nThe nurse led the  time- out, retrieved the doctor a few minutes \nlater, and the procedure occurred without complication. She never contradicted a physician again, and never said anything when other safety policies were ignored.\n“Some doctors were ﬁ  ne, and some",

His jaw was slack, his eyes closed, and the top of an intubation tube peeked above his lips. As a nurse hooked him up to a machine that would force air into his lungs during surgery, one of his arms slipped off the gurney, the skin mottled with liver spots.\nThe man was  eighty- six years old and, three days earlier, had \nfallen at home. Afterward, he had trouble staying awake and an-swering questions, and so eventually his wife called an ambulance. In the emergency room, a doctor asked him what happened, but the man kept nodding off in the middle of his sentences. A scan of his head revealed why: The fall had slammed his brain against his skull, causing what’s known as a subdural hematoma. Blood was pooling within the left portion of his cranium, pushing against the delicate folds of tissue inside his skull.

Unless the blood \nwas drained, the man would die.\nAt the time, Rhode Island Hospital was one of the nation ’s lead-\ning medical institutions, the main teaching hospital for Brown Uni-versity and the only Level I trauma center in southeastern New England. Inside the tall brick and glass building, physicians had pio-neered  cutting- edge medical techniques, including the use of ultra-sound waves to destroy tumors inside a patient’s body. In 2002, the National Coalition on Health Care rated the hospital’s intensive care unit as one of the ﬁ  nest in the country.\nBut by the time the elderly patient arrived, Rhode Island Hospi-\ntal also had another reputation: a place riven by internal tensions.

There were deep, simmering enmities between nurses and physi-cians. In 2000, the nurses’ union had voted to strike after com-plaining that they were being forced to work dangerously long hours. More than three hundred of them stood outside the hospi-tal with signs reading “Stop Slavery” and “They can ’t take away our pride.”\n“This place can be awful,” one nurse recalled telling a reporter. \n“The doctors can make you feel like you’re worthless, like you’re disposable. Like you should be thankful to pick up after them.”\nAdministrators eventually agreed to limit nurses’ mandatory \novertime, but tensions continued to rise. A few years later, a surgeon was preparing for a routine abdominal operation when a nurse called for a  “time- out.” Such pauses are standard procedure at most hospitals, a way for doctors and staff to make sure mistakes are avoided. The nursing staff at Rhode Island Hospital was insistent on  time- outs, particularly since a surgeon had accidentally removed the tonsils of a girl who was supposed to have eye surgery.  Time- outs were supposed to catch such errors before they occurred.\nAt the abdominal surgery, when the OR nurse asked the team to \ngather around the patient for a  time- out and to discuss their plan, the doctor headed for the doors.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   155 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   155 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n156 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\n“Why don ’t you lead this?” the surgeon told the nurse. “I’m going \nto step outside for a call. Knock when you’re ready.”\n“You’re supposed to be here for this, Doctor,” she replied.“You can handle it,” the surgeon said, as he walked toward the \ndoor.\n“Doctor, I don ’t feel this is appropriate.”The doctor stopped and looked at her. “If I want your damn opin-\nion, I’ll ask for it,” he said. “Don ’t ever question my authority again. If you can ’t do your job, get the hell out of my OR.”\nThe nurse led the ",

    "text": " country.\nBut by the time the elderly patient arrived, Rhode Island Hospi-\ntal also had another reputation: a place riven by internal tensions. There were deep, simmering enmities between nurses and physi-cians. In 2000, the nurses’ union had voted to strike after com-plaining that they were being forced to work dangerously long hours. More than three hundred of them stood outside the hospi-tal with signs reading “Stop Slavery” and “They can ’t take away our pride.”\n“This place can be awful,” one nurse recalled telling a reporter. \n“The doctors can make you feel like you’re worthless, like you’re disposable. Like you should be thankful to pick up after them.”\nAdministrators eventually agreed to limit nurses’ mandatory \novertime, but tensions continued to rise. A few years later, a surgeon was preparing for a routine abdominal operation when a nurse called for a  “time- out.” Such pauses are standard procedure at most hospitals, a way for doctors and staff to make sure mistakes are avoided. The nursing staff at Rhode Island Hospital was insistent on  time- outs, particularly since a surgeon had accidentally removed the tonsils of a girl who was supposed to have eye surgery.

She never contradicted a physician again, and never said anything when other safety policies were ignored.\n“Some doctors were ﬁ  ne, and some were monsters,” one nurse \nwho worked at Rhode Island Hospital in the mid-2000s told me. “We called it the glass factory, because it felt like everything could crash down at any minute.”\nTo deal with these tensions, the staff had developed informal \n rules— habits unique to the  institution— that helped avert the most obvious conﬂ  icts. Nurses, for instance, always  double- checked \nthe orders of  error- prone physicians and quietly made sure that correct doses were entered; they took extra time to write clearly on patients’ charts, lest a hasty surgeon make the wrong cut. One nurse told me they developed a system of color codes to warn one another. “We put doctors’ names in different colors on the white-boards,” she said. “Blue meant ‘nice,’ red meant ‘jerk,’ and black meant, ‘whatever you do, don ’t contradict them or they’ll take your head off.’”\nRhode Island Hospital was a place ﬁ  lled with a corrosive culture. \nUnlike at Alcoa, where carefully designed keystone habits surround-ing worker safety had created larger and larger successes, inside Rhode Island Hospital, habits emerged on the ﬂ  y among nurses \nseeking to offset physician arrogance. The hospital’s routines weren ’t \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   156 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   156 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Power of a Crisis ● 157\ncarefully thought out. Rather, they appeared by accident and spread \nthrough whispered warnings, until toxic patterns emerged. This can happen within any organization where habits aren ’t deliberately planned. Just as choosing the right keystone habits can create amaz-ing change, the wrong ones can create disasters.\nAnd when the habits within Rhode Island Hospital imploded, \nthey caused terrible mistakes.\n● ● ●\nWhen the emergency room staff saw the brain scans of the  eighty- six- year- old man with the subdural hematoma, they immedi-ately paged the neurosurgeon on duty. He was in the middle of a routine spinal surgery, but when he got the page, he stepped away from the operating table and looked at images of the elderly man ’s head on a computer screen. The surgeon told his  assistant— a nurse  practitioner— to go to the emergency room and get the man ’s wife to sign a consent form approving surgery. He ﬁ  nished his spinal pro-\ncedure. A half hour later, the elderly man was wheeled into the same operating theater.\nNurses were rushing around. The unconscious elderly man was \nplaced on the table. A nurse picked up his consent form and medi-cal chart.\n“Doctor,” the nurse said, looking at the patient’s chart. “The con-\nsent form doesn ’t say where the hematoma is.” The nurse leafed through the paperwork. There was no clear indication of which side of his head they were supposed to operate on.\nEvery hospital relies upon paperwork to guide surgeries. Before \nany cut is made, a patient or family member is supposed to sign a document approving each procedure and verifying the details. In a chaotic environment, where as many as a dozen doctors and nurses may handle a patient between the ER and the recovery suite, con-sent forms are the instructions that keep track of what is supposed \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   157 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   157 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n158 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nto occur. Except in emergencies, no one is supposed to go into sur-\ngery without a signed and detailed consent.\n“I saw the scans before,” the surgeon said. “It was the right side \nof the head. If we don ’t do this quickly, he’s gonna die.”\n“Maybe we should pull up the ﬁ  lms again,” the nurse said, mov-\ning toward a computer terminal. For security reasons, the hospital’s computers locked after ﬁ  fteen minutes of idling. It would take at \nleast a minute for the nurse to log in and load the patient’s brain scans onto the screen.\n“We don ’t have time,” the surgeon said. “They told me he’s crash-\ning. We’ve got to relieve the pressure.”\n“What if we ﬁ  nd the",

She never contradicted a physician again, and never said anything when other safety policies were ignored.\n“Some doctors were ﬁ  ne, and some were monsters,” one nurse \nwho worked at Rhode Island Hospital in the mid-2000s told me. “We called it the glass factory, because it felt like everything could crash down at any minute.”\nTo deal with these tensions, the staff had developed informal \n rules— habits unique to the  institution— that helped avert the most obvious conﬂ  icts. Nurses, for instance, always  double- checked \nthe orders of  error- prone physicians and quietly made sure that correct doses were entered; they took extra time to write clearly on patients’ charts, lest a hasty surgeon make the wrong cut. One nurse told me they developed a system of color codes to warn one another. “We put doctors’ names in different colors on the white-boards,” she said. “Blue meant ‘nice,’ red meant ‘jerk,’ and black meant, ‘whatever you do, don ’t contradict them or they’ll take your head off.’”\nRhode Island Hospital was a place ﬁ  lled with a corrosive culture. \nUnlike at Alcoa, where carefully designed keystone habits surround-ing worker safety had created larger and larger successes, inside Rhode Island Hospital, habits emerged on the ﬂ  y among nurses \nseeking to offset physician arrogance.

He was in the middle of a routine spinal surgery, but when he got the page, he stepped away from the operating table and looked at images of the elderly man ’s head on a computer screen. The surgeon told his  assistant— a nurse  practitioner— to go to the emergency room and get the man ’s wife to sign a consent form approving surgery. He ﬁ  nished his spinal pro-\ncedure. A half hour later, the elderly man was wheeled into the same operating theater.\nNurses were rushing around. The unconscious elderly man was \nplaced on the table. A nurse picked up his consent form and medi-cal chart.\n“Doctor,” the nurse said, looking at the patient’s chart. “The con-\nsent form doesn ’t say where the hematoma is.” The nurse leafed through the paperwork. There was no clear indication of which side of his head they were supposed to operate on.\nEvery hospital relies upon paperwork to guide surgeries. Before \nany cut is made, a patient or family member is supposed to sign a document approving each procedure and verifying the details.

Except in emergencies, no one is supposed to go into sur-\ngery without a signed and detailed consent.\n“I saw the scans before,” the surgeon said. “It was the right side \nof the head. If we don ’t do this quickly, he’s gonna die.”\n“Maybe we should pull up the ﬁ  lms again,” the nurse said, mov-\ning toward a computer terminal.

He was in the middle of a routine spinal surgery, but when he got the page, he stepped away from the operating table and looked at images of the elderly man ’s head on a computer screen. The surgeon told his  assistant— a nurse  practitioner— to go to the emergency room and get the man ’s wife to sign a consent form approving surgery. He ﬁ  nished his spinal pro-\ncedure. A half hour later, the elderly man was wheeled into the same operating theater.\nNurses were rushing around. The unconscious elderly man was \nplaced on the table. A nurse picked up his consent form and medi-cal chart.\n“Doctor,” the nurse said, looking at the patient’s chart. “The con-\nsent form doesn ’t say where the hematoma is.” The nurse leafed through the paperwork. There was no clear indication of which side of his head they were supposed to operate on.\nEvery hospital relies upon paperwork to guide surgeries. Before \nany",

We’ve got to relieve the pressure.”\n“What if we ﬁ  nd the family?” the nurse asked.\n“If that’s what you want, then call the fucking ER and ﬁ  nd the \nfamily! In the meantime, I’m going to save his life.” The surgeon grabbed the paperwork, scribbled “right” on the consent form, and initialed it.\n“There,” he said. “We have to operate immediately.”The nurse had worked at Rhode Island Hospital for a year. He \nunderstood the hospital’s culture. This surgeon ’s name, the nurse knew, was often scribbled in black on the large whiteboard in the hallway, signaling that nurses should beware. The unwritten rules in this scenario were clear: The surgeon always wins.\nThe nurse put down the chart and stood aside as the doctor posi-\ntioned the elderly man ’s head in a cradle that provided access to the right side of his skull and shaved and applied antiseptic to his head. The plan was to open the skull and suction out the blood pooling on top of his brain. The surgeon sliced away a ﬂ  ap of scalp, exposed the \nskull, and put a drill against the white bone. He began pushing until the bit broke through with a soft pop. He made two more holes and used a saw to cut out a triangular piece of the man ’s skull. Under-neath was the dura, the translucent sheath surrounding the brain.\n“Oh my God,” someone said.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   158 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   158 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Power of a Crisis ● 159\nThere was no hematoma. They were operating on the wrong side \nof the head.\n“We need him turned!” the surgeon yelled.The triangle of bone was reattached with small metal plates and \nscrews, and the patient’s scalp sewed up. His head was shifted to the other side and then, once again, shaved, cleansed, cut, and drilled until a triangle of skull could be removed. This time, the hematoma was immediately visible, a dark bulge that spilled like thick syrup when the dura was pierced. The surgeon vacuumed the blood and the pressure inside the old man ’s skull fell immediately. The sur-gery, which should have taken about an hour, had run almost twice as long.\nAfterward, the patient was taken to the intensive care unit, but he \nnever regained full consciousness. Two weeks later, he died.\nA subsequent investigation said it was impossible to determine \nthe precise cause of death, but the patient’s family argued that the trauma of the medical error had overwhelmed his already fragile body, that the stress of removing two pieces of skull, the additional time in surgery, and the delay in evacuating the hematoma had pushed him over the edge. If not for the mistake, they claimed, he might still be alive. The hospital paid a settlement and the surgeon was barred from ever working at Rhode Island Hospital again.\nSuch an accident, some nurses later claimed, was inevitable. \nRhode Island Hospital’s institutional habits were so dysfunctional, it was only a matter of time until a grievous mistake occurred.* It’s not just hospitals that breed dangerous patterns, of course. Destruc-tive organizational habits can be found within hundreds of indus-tries and at thousands of ﬁ  rms. And almost always, they are the \n*The reporting in this chapter is based upon interviews with multiple people working at Rhode \nIsland Hospital and involved in this incident some of whom provided different accounts of the events.

There are no or-ganizations without institutional habits. There are only places where they are deliberately designed, and places where they are created without forethought, so they often grow from rivalries or fear.\nBut sometimes, even destructive habits can be transformed by \nleaders who know how to seize the right opportunities. Sometimes, in the heat of a crisis, the right habits emerge.\nII.\nWhen An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change  was ﬁ  rst pub-\n",

We’ve got to relieve the pressure.”\n“What if we ﬁ  nd the family?” the nurse asked.\n“If that’s what you want, then call the fucking ER and ﬁ  nd the \nfamily! In the meantime, I’m going to save his life.” The surgeon grabbed the paperwork, scribbled “right” on the consent form, and initialed it.\n“There,” he said. “We have to operate immediately.”The nurse had worked at Rhode Island Hospital for a year. He \nunderstood the hospital’s culture. This surgeon ’s name, the nurse knew, was often scribbled in black on the large whiteboard in the hallway, signaling that nurses should beware. The unwritten rules in this scenario were clear: The surgeon always wins.\nThe nurse put down the chart and stood aside as the doctor posi-\ntioned the elderly man ’s head in a cradle that provided access to the right side of his skull and shaved and applied antiseptic to his head. The plan was to open the skull and suction out the blood pooling on top of his brain. The surgeon sliced away a ﬂ  ap of scalp, exposed the \nskull, and put a drill against the white bone. He began pushing until the bit broke through with a soft pop. He made two more holes and used a saw to cut out a triangular piece of the man ’s skull. Under-neath was the dura, the translucent sheath surrounding the brain.\n“Oh my God,” someone said.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   158 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   158 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Power of a Crisis ● 159\nThere was no hematoma. They were operating on the wrong side \nof the head.\n“We need him turned!” the surgeon yelled.The triangle of bone was reattached with small metal plates and \nscrews, and the patient’s scalp sewed up. His head was shifted to the other side and then, once again, shaved, cleansed, cut, and drilled until a triangle of skull could be removed. This time, the hematoma was immediately visible,",

The surgeon vacuumed the blood and the pressure inside the old man ’s skull fell immediately. The sur-gery, which should have taken about an hour, had run almost twice as long.\nAfterward, the patient was taken to the intensive care unit, but he \nnever regained full consciousness. Two weeks later, he died.\nA subsequent investigation said it was impossible to determine \nthe precise cause of death, but the patient’s family argued that the trauma of the medical error had overwhelmed his already fragile body, that the stress of removing two pieces of skull, the additional time in surgery, and the delay in evacuating the hematoma had pushed him over the edge.

    "text": " even destructive habits can be transformed by \nleaders who know how to seize the right opportunities. Sometimes, in the heat of a crisis, the right habits emerge.\nII.\nWhen An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change  was ﬁ  rst pub-\nlished in 1982, very few people outside of academia noticed. The book’s bland cover and daunting ﬁ  rst sentence—“In this volume we \ndevelop an evolutionary theory of the capabilities and behavior of business ﬁ  rms operating in a market environment, and construct \nand analyze a number of models consistent with that theory”—almost seemed designed to ward off readers. The authors, Yale pro-fessors Richard Nelson and Sidney Winter, were best known for a series of intensely analytic papers exploring Schumpeterian theory that even most PhD candidates didn ’t pretend to understand.\nWithin the world of business strategy and organizational theory, \nhowever, the book went off like a bombshell. It was soon hailed as one of the most important texts of the century. Economics profes-sors started talking about it to their colleagues at business schools, who started talking to CEOs at conferences, and soon executives were quoting Nelson and Winter inside corporations as different as General Electric, Pﬁ  zer, and Starwood Hotels.\nNelson and Winter had spent more than a decade examining \nhow companies work, trudging through swamps of data before arriv ing at their central conclusion: “Much of ﬁ  rm behavior,” they \nwrote, is best “understood as a reﬂ  ection of general habits and stra-\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   160 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   160 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Power of a Crisis ● 161\ntegic orientations coming from the ﬁ  rm ’s past,” rather than “the re-\nsult of a detailed survey of the remote twigs of the decision tree.”\nOr, put in language that people use outside of theoretical eco-\nnomics, it may seem like most organizations make rational choices \nbased on deliberate decision making, but that’s not really how com-panies operate at all. Instead, ﬁ  rms are guided by  long- held organi-\nzational habits, patterns that often emerge from thousands of employees’ independent decisions. And these habits have more pro-found impacts than anyone previously understood.\nFor instance, it might seem like the chief executive of a clothing \ncompany made the decision last year to feature a red cardigan on the catalog’s cover by carefully reviewing sales and marketing data. But, in fact, what really happened was that his vice president con-stantly trolls websites devoted to Japanese fashion trends (where red was hip last spring), and the ﬁ  rm ’s marketers routinely ask their \nfriends which colors are “in,” and the company’s executives, back from their annual trip to the Paris runway shows, reported hearing that designers at rival ﬁ  rms were using new magenta pigments. All \nthese small inputs, the result of uncoordinated patterns among ex-ecutives gossiping about competitors and talking to their friends, got mixed into the company’s more formal research and develop-ment routines until a consensus emerged: Red will be popular this year. No one made a solitary, deliberate decision. Rather, dozens of habits, processes, and behaviors converged until it seemed like red was the inevitable choice.\nThese organizational  habits— or “routines,” as Nelson and Win-\nter called  them— are enormously important, because without them, most companies would never get any work done. Routines provide the hundreds of unwritten rules that companies need to operate. They allow workers to experiment with new ideas without having to ask for permission at every step. They provide a kind of “organiza-tional memory,” so that managers don ’t have to reinvent the sales \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   161 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   161 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n162 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nprocess every six months or panic each time a VP quits. Routines \nreduce  uncertainty— a study of recovery efforts after earthquakes in Mexico and Los Angeles, for instance, found that the habits of relief workers (which they carried from disaster to disaster, and which included things such as establishing communication networks by hiring children to carry messages between neighborhoods) were ab-solutely critical, “because without them, policy formulation and implementation would be lost in a jungle of detail.”\nBut among the most important beneﬁ  ts of routines is that they \ncreate truces between potentially warring groups or individuals within an",

    "text": " even destructive habits can be transformed by \nleaders who know how to seize the right opportunities. Sometimes, in the heat of a crisis, the right habits emerge.\nII.\nWhen An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change  was ﬁ  rst pub-\nlished in 1982, very few people outside of academia noticed. The book’s bland cover and daunting ﬁ  rst sentence—“In this volume we \ndevelop an evolutionary theory of the capabilities and behavior of business ﬁ  rms operating in a market environment, and construct \nand analyze a number of models consistent with that theory”—almost seemed designed to ward off readers. The authors, Yale pro-fessors Richard Nelson and Sidney Winter, were best known for a series of intensely analytic papers exploring Schumpeterian theory that even most PhD candidates didn ’t pretend to understand.\nWithin the world of business strategy and organizational theory, \nhowever, the book went off like a bombshell. It was soon hailed as one of the most important texts of the century.

    "text": " even destructive habits can be transformed by \nleaders who know how to seize the right opportunities. Sometimes, in the heat of a crisis, the right habits emerge.\nII.\nWhen An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change  was ﬁ  rst pub-\nlished in 1982, very few people outside of academia noticed. The book’s bland cover and daunting ﬁ  rst sentence—“In this volume we \ndevelop an evolutionary theory of the capabilities and behavior of business ﬁ  rms operating in a market environment, and construct \nand analyze a number of models consistent with that theory”—almost seemed designed to ward off readers. The authors, Yale pro-fessors Richard Nelson and Sidney Winter, were best known for a series of intensely analytic papers exploring Schumpeterian theory that even most PhD candidates didn ’t pretend to understand.\nWithin the world of business strategy and organizational theory, \nhowever, the book went off like a bombshell. It was soon hailed as one of the most important texts of the century. Economics profes-sors started talking about it to their colleagues at business schools, who started talking to CEOs at conferences, and soon executives were quoting Nelson and Winter inside corporations as different as General Electric, Pﬁ  zer, and Starwood Hotels.\n",

Instead, ﬁ  rms are guided by  long- held organi-\nzational habits, patterns that often emerge from thousands of employees’ independent decisions. And these habits have more pro-found impacts than anyone previously understood.\nFor instance, it might seem like the chief executive of a clothing \ncompany made the decision last year to feature a red cardigan on the catalog’s cover by carefully reviewing sales and marketing data. But, in fact, what really happened was that his vice president con-stantly trolls websites devoted to Japanese fashion trends (where red was hip last spring), and the ﬁ  rm ’s marketers routinely ask their \nfriends which colors are “in,” and the company’s executives, back from their annual trip to the Paris runway shows, reported hearing that designers at rival ﬁ  rms were using new magenta pigments. All \nthese small inputs, the result of uncoordinated patterns among ex-ecutives gossiping about competitors and talking to their friends, got mixed into the company’s more formal research and develop-ment routines until a consensus emerged: Red will be popular this year. No one made a solitary, deliberate decision. Rather, dozens of habits, processes, and behaviors converged until it seemed like red was the inevitable choice.\nThese organizational  habits— or “routines,” as Nelson and Win-\nter called  them— are enormously important, because without them, most companies would never get any work done. Routines provide the hundreds of unwritten rules that companies need to operate. They allow workers to experiment with new ideas without having to ask for permission at every step. They provide a kind of “organiza-tional memory,” so that managers don ’t have to reinvent the sales \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   161 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   161 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n162 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nprocess every six months or panic each time a VP quits.

All \nthese small inputs, the result of uncoordinated patterns among ex-ecutives gossiping about competitors and talking to their friends, got mixed into the company’s more formal research and develop-ment routines until a consensus emerged: Red will be popular this year.

Nelson and Winter pointed out that, in the real world, that’s not how things work at all. Companies aren ’t big happy families where everyone plays together nicely. Rather, most workplaces are made up of ﬁ  efdoms where executives compete for \npower and credit, often in hidden skirmishes that make their own performances appear superior and their rivals’ seem worse. Divi-sions compete for resources and sabotage each other to steal glory. Bosses pit their subordinates against one another so that no one can mount a coup.\nCompanies aren ’t families. They’re battleﬁ  elds in a civil war.\nYet despite this capacity for internecine warfare, most companies \nroll along relatively peacefully, year after year, because they have  routines— habits— that create truces that allow everyone to set aside their rivalries long enough to get a day’s work done.\nOrganizational habits offer a basic promise: If you follow the es-\ntablished patterns and abide by the truce, then rivalries won ’t de-stroy the company, the proﬁ  ts will roll in, and, eventually, everyone \nwill get rich. A salesperson, for example, knows she can boost her bonus by giving favored customers hefty discounts in exchange for larger orders. But she also knows that if every salesperson gives \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   162 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   162 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Power of a Crisis ● 163\naway hefty discounts, the ﬁ  rm will go bankrupt and there won ’t be \nany bonuses to hand out. So a routine emerges: The salespeople all get together every January and agree to limit how many discounts they offer in order to protect the company’s proﬁ  ts, and at the end of \nthe year everyone gets a raise.\nOr take a young executive gunning for vice president who, with \none quiet phone call to a major customer, could kill a sale and sabo-tage a colleague’s division, taking him out of the running for the promotion. The problem with sabotage is that even if it’s good for you, it’s usually bad for the ﬁ  rm. So at most companies, an unspo-\nken compact emerges: It’s okay to be ambitious, but if you play too \nrough, your peers will unite against you. On the other hand, if you focus on boosting your own department, rather than undermining your rival, you’ll probably get taken care of over time.\nRoutines and truces offer a type of rough organizational justice, \nand because of them, Nelson and Winter wrote, conﬂ  ict within com-\npanies usually “follows largely predictable paths and stays within predictable bounds that are consistent with the ongoing rou-tine. . . . The usual amount of work gets done, reprimands and com-pliments are delivered with the usual frequency. . . . Nobody is trying to steer the organizational ship into a sharp turn in the hope of throwing a rival overboard.”Routine\nReward CueRoutine\nReward Cue\nROUTINES CREATE TRUCES \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   163 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   163 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n164 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nMost of the time, routines and truces work perfectly. Rivalries \nstill exist, of course, but because of institutional habits, they’re kept within bounds and the business thrives.\nHowever, sometimes even a truce proves insufﬁ  cient. Some-\ntimes, as Rhode Island Hospital discovered, an unstable peace can be as destructive as any civil war.\n● ● ●\nSomewhere in your ofﬁ  ce, buried in a desk drawer, there’s probably \na handbook you received on your ﬁ  rst day of work. It contains ex-\npense forms and rules about vacations, insurance options, and the company’s organizational chart. It has brightly colored graphs de-scribing different health care plans, a list of relevant phone num-bers, and instructions on how to access your email or enroll in the 401(k).\nNow, imagine what you would tell a new colleague who asked for \n",

Nelson and Winter pointed out that, in the real world, that’s not how things work at all. Companies aren ’t big happy families where everyone plays together nicely. Rather, most workplaces are made up of ﬁ  efdoms where executives compete for \npower and credit, often in hidden skirmishes that make their own performances appear superior and their rivals’ seem worse. Divi-sions compete for resources and sabotage each other to steal glory. Bosses pit their subordinates against one another so that no one can mount a coup.\nCompanies aren ’t families. They’re battleﬁ  elds in a civil war.\nYet despite this capacity for internecine warfare, most companies \nroll along relatively peacefully, year after year, because they have  routines— habits— that create truces that allow everyone to set aside their rivalries long enough to get a day’s work done.\nOrganizational habits offer a basic promise: If you follow the es-\ntablished patterns and abide by the truce, then rivalries won ’t de-stroy the company, the proﬁ  ts will roll in, and, eventually, everyone \nwill get rich. A salesperson, for example, knows she can boost her bonus by giving favored customers hefty discounts in exchange for larger orders. But she also knows that if every salesperson gives \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   162 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   162 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Power of a Crisis ● 163\naway hefty discounts, the ﬁ  rm will go bankrupt and there won ’t be \nany bonuses to hand out. So a routine emerges: The salespeople all get together every January and agree to limit how many discounts they offer in order to protect the company’s proﬁ  ts, and at the end of \nthe year everyone gets a raise.\nOr take a young executive gunning for vice president",

The problem with sabotage is that even if it’s good for you, it’s usually bad for the ﬁ  rm. So at most companies, an unspo-\nken compact emerges: It’s okay to be ambitious, but if you play too \nrough, your peers will unite against you. On the other hand, if you focus on boosting your own department, rather than undermining your rival, you’ll probably get taken care of over time.\nRoutines and truces offer a type of rough organizational justice, \nand because of them, Nelson and Winter wrote, conﬂ  ict within com-\npanies usually “follows largely predictable paths and stays within predictable bounds that are consistent with the ongoing rou-tine. . . .

    "text": " all get together every January and agree to limit how many discounts they offer in order to protect the company’s proﬁ  ts, and at the end of \nthe year everyone gets a raise.\nOr take a young executive gunning for vice president who, with \none quiet phone call to a major customer, could kill a sale and sabo-tage a colleague’s division, taking him out of the running for the promotion. The problem with sabotage is that even if it’s good for you, it’s usually bad for the ﬁ  rm. So at most companies, an unspo-\nken compact emerges: It’s okay to be ambitious, but if you play too \nrough, your peers will unite against you.

Your recommendations \nprobably wouldn ’t contain anything you’d ﬁ  nd in the company’s \nhandbook. Instead, the tips you would pass  along— who is trustwor-thy; which secretaries have more clout than their bosses; how to manipulate the bureaucracy to get something  done— are the habits you rely on every day to survive. If you could somehow diagram all your work  habits— and the informal power structures, relation-ships, alliances, and conﬂ  icts they  represent— and then overlay your \ndiagram with diagrams prepared by your colleagues, it would create a map of your ﬁ  rm ’s secret hierarchy, a guide to who knows how to \nmake things happen and who never seems to get ahead of the ball.\nNelson and Winter’s  routines— and the truces they make \n possible— are critical to every kind of business. One study from Utrecht University in the Netherlands, for instance, looked at rou-tines within the world of high fashion. To survive, every fashion designer has to possess some basic skills: creativity and a ﬂ  air for \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   164 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   164 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Power of a Crisis ● 165\nhaute couture as a start. But that’s not enough to succeed. What \nmakes the difference between success or failure are a designer’s  routines— whether they have a system for getting Italian broadcloth before wholesalers’ stocks sell out, a process for ﬁ  nding the best zip-\nper and button seamstresses, a routine for shipping a dress to a store in ten days, rather than three weeks. Fashion is such a compli-cated business that, without the right processes, a new company will get bogged down with logistics, and once that happens, creativity ceases to matter.\nAnd which new designers are most likely to have the right hab-\nits? The ones who have formed the right truces and found the right alliances. Truces are so important that new fashion labels usually succeed only if they are headed by people who left other fashion \ncompanies on good terms.\nSome might think Nelson and Winter were writing a book on dry \neconomic theory. But what they really produced was a guide to sur-viving in corporate America.\nWhat’s more, Nelson and Winter’s theories also explain why \nthings went so wrong at Rhode Island Hospital. The hospital had routines that created an uneasy peace between nurses and  doctors— the whiteboards, for instance, and the warnings nurses whispered to one another were habits that established a baseline truce. These delicate pacts allowed the organization to function most of the time. But truces are only durable when they create real justice. If a truce is  unbalanced— if the peace isn ’t  real— then the routines often fail when they are needed most.\nThe critical issue at Rhode Island Hospital was that the nurses \nwere the only ones giving up power to strike a truce. It was the nurses who  double- checked patients’ medications and made extra efforts to write clearly on charts; the nurses who absorbed abuse from  stressed- out doctors; the nurses who helped separate kind physicians from the despots, so the rest of the staff knew who toler-ated  operating- room suggestions and who would explode if you \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   165 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   165 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n166 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nopened your mouth. The doctors often didn ’t bother to learn the \nnurses’ names. “The doctors were in charge, and we were under-lings,” one nurse told me. “We tucked our tails and survived.”\nThe truces at Rhode Island Hospital were  one- sided. So at those \ncrucial  moments— when, for instance, a surgeon was about to make a hasty incision and a nurse tried to  intervene— the routines that could have prevented the accident crumbled, and the wrong side of an  eighty- six- year- old man ’s head was opened up.\nSome might suggest that the solution is more equitable truces. \nThat if the hospital’s leadership did a better job of allocating author-ity",

Your recommendations \nprobably wouldn ’t contain anything you’d ﬁ  nd in the company’s \nhandbook. Instead, the tips you would pass  along— who is trustwor-thy; which secretaries have more clout than their bosses; how to manipulate the bureaucracy to get something  done— are the habits you rely on every day to survive. If you could somehow diagram all your work  habits— and the informal power structures, relation-ships, alliances, and conﬂ  icts they  represent— and then overlay your \ndiagram with diagrams prepared by your colleagues, it would create a map of your ﬁ  rm ’s secret hierarchy, a guide to who knows how to \nmake things happen and who never seems to get ahead of the ball.\nNelson and Winter’s  routines— and the truces they make \n possible— are critical to every kind of business.

The ones who have formed the right truces and found the right alliances. Truces are so important that new fashion labels usually succeed only if they are headed by people who left other fashion \ncompanies on good terms.\nSome might think Nelson and Winter were writing a book on dry \neconomic theory. But what they really produced was a guide to sur-viving in corporate America.\nWhat’s more, Nelson and Winter’s theories also explain why \nthings went so wrong at Rhode Island Hospital. The hospital had routines that created an uneasy peace between nurses and  doctors— the whiteboards, for instance, and the warnings nurses whispered to one another were habits that established a baseline truce. These delicate pacts allowed the organization to function most of the time. But truces are only durable when they create real justice. If a truce is  unbalanced— if the peace isn ’t  real— then the routines often fail when they are needed most.\nThe critical issue at Rhode Island Hospital was that the nurses \nwere the only ones giving up power to strike a truce. It was the nurses who  double- checked patients’ medications and made extra efforts to write clearly on charts; the nurses who absorbed abuse from  stressed- out doctors; the nurses who helped separate kind physicians from the despots, so the rest of the staff knew who toler-ated  operating- room suggestions and who would explode if you \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   165 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   165 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n166 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nopened your mouth. The doctors often didn ’t bother to learn the \nnurses’ names. “The doctors were in charge, and we were under-lings,” one nurse told me. “We tucked our tails and survived.”\nThe truces at Rhode Island Hospital were  one- sided. So at those \ncrucial  moments— when, for instance, a surgeon was about to make a hasty incision and a nurse tried to  intervene— the routines that could have prevented the accident crumbled,",

Unfortunately, it isn ’t enough. Creating suc-\ncessful organizations isn ’t just a matter of balancing authority. For an organization to work, leaders must cultivate habits that both cre-ate a real and balanced peace and, paradoxically, make it absolutely clear who’s in charge.\nIII.\nPhilip Brickell, a  forty- three- year- old employee of the London Un-derground, was inside the cavernous main hall of the King’s Cross subway station on a November evening in 1987 when a commuter stopped him as he was collecting tickets and said there was a burn-ing tissue at the bottom of a nearby escalator.\nKing’s Cross was one of the largest, grandest, and most heavily \ntrafﬁ cked of London ’s subway stops, a labyrinth of deep escalators, \npassageways, and tunnels, some of which were almost a century old. The station ’s escalators, in particular, were famous for their size and age. Some stretched as many as ﬁ  ve stories into the ground and \nwere built of wooden slats and rubber handrails, the same materials used to construct them decades earlier. More than a quarter million passengers passed through King’s Cross every day on six different \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   166 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   166 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Power of a Crisis ● 167\ntrain lines. During evening rush hour, the station ’s ticketing hall \nwas a sea of people hurrying beneath a ceiling repainted so many times that no one could recall its original hue.\nThe burning tissue, the passenger said, was at the bottom of one \nof the station ’s longest escalators, servicing the Piccadilly line. Brick-ell immediately left his position, rode the escalator down to the plat-form, found the smoldering wad of tissue, and, with a  rolled- up magazine, beat out the ﬁ  re. Then he returned to his post.EXITEXIT\nEXIT\nPICCAD\nILL\nY L\nINE    \n  \nVICTORIA LINE\nNORTHEN LINEPICCADILLY \nLINE \nESCALATOR      TICKETING HALL\nVICTORIA\nLINE\nESCALATOREXIT EXIT\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   167 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   167 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n168 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nBrickell didn ’t investigate further. He didn ’t try to ﬁ  gure out why \nthe tissue was burning or if it might have ﬂ  own off of a larger ﬁ  re \nsomewhere else within the station. He didn ’t mention the incident to another employee or call the ﬁ  re department. A separate depart-\nment handled ﬁ  re safety, and Brickell, in keeping with the strict divi-\nsions that ruled the Underground, knew better than to step on anyone’s toes. Besides, even if he had investigated the possibility of \na ﬁ re, he wouldn ’t have known what to do with any information he \nlearned. The tightly prescribed chain of command at the Under-ground prohibited him from contacting another department with-out a superior’s direct authorization. And the Underground’s  routines— handed down from employee to  employee— told him that he should never, under any circumstances, refer out loud to anything  inside a station as a “ﬁ  re,” lest commuters become pan-\nicked. It wasn ’t how things were done.\nThe Underground was governed by a sort of theoretical rule book \nthat no one had ever seen or  read— and that didn ’t, in fact, exist ex-cept in the unwritten rules that shaped every employee’s life.

Besides, even if he had investigated the possibility of \na ﬁ re, he wouldn ’t have known what to do with any information he \nlearned. The tightly prescribed chain of command at the Under-ground prohibited him from contacting another department with-out a superior’s direct authorization. And the Underground’s  routines— handed down from employee to  employee— told him that he should never, under any circumstances, refer out loud to anything  inside a station as a “ﬁ  re,” lest commuters become pan-\nicked. It wasn ’t how things were done.\nThe Underground was governed by a sort of theoretical rule book \nthat no one had ever seen or  read— and that didn ’t, in fact, exist ex-cept in the unwritten rules that shaped every employee’s life. For decades, the Underground had been run by the “Four Barons”—the chiefs of civil, signal, electrical, and mechanical  engineering— and within each of their departments, there were bosses",

The trains ran on time because all nineteen thousand Underground employees cooperated in a delicate system that passed passengers and trains among  dozens— sometimes  hundreds— of hands all day long. But that co-operation depended upon a balance of power between each of the four departments and all their lieutenants that, itself, relied upon thousands of habits that employees adhered to. These habits created a truce among the Four Barons and their deputies. And from that truce arose policies that told Brickell: Looking for ﬁ  res isn ’t your job. \nDon ’t overstep your bounds.\n“Even at the highest level, one director was unlikely to trespass \non the territory of another,” an investigator would later note. “Thus, \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   168 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   168 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Power of a Crisis ● 169\nthe engineering director did not concern himself with whether the \noperating staff were properly trained in ﬁ  re safety and evacuation \nprocedures because he considered those matters to be the province of the Operations Directorate.”\nSo Brickell didn ’t say anything about the burning tissue. In other \ncircumstances, it might have been an unimportant detail. In this case, the tissue was a stray  warning— a bit of fuel that had escaped from a larger, hidden  blaze— that would show how perilous even perfectly balanced truces can become if they aren ’t designed just right.\nFifteen minutes after Brickell returned to his booth, another pas-\nsenger noticed a wisp of smoke as he rode up the Piccadilly escala-tor; he mentioned it to an Underground employee. The King’s Cross safety inspector, Christopher Hayes, was eventually roused to inves-tigate. A third passenger, seeing smoke and a glow from underneath the escalator’s stairs, hit an emergency stop button and began shout-ing at passengers to exit the escalator. A policeman saw a slight smoky haze inside the escalator’s long tunnel, and, halfway down, ﬂ ames beginning to dart above the steps.\nYet the safety inspector, Hayes, didn ’t call the London Fire Bri-\ngade. He hadn ’t seen any smoke himself, and another of the Under-ground’s unwritten rules was that the ﬁ  re department should never \nbe contacted unless absolutely necessary. The policeman who had noticed the haze, however, ﬁ  gured he should contact headquarters. \nHis radio didn ’t work underground, so he walked up a long staircase into the outdoors and called his superiors, who eventually passed word to the ﬁ  re department. At 7:36 \nP.M.— twenty- two minutes after \nBrickell was alerted to the ﬂ  aming  tissue— the ﬁ  re brigade received \na call: “Small ﬁ  re at King’s Cross.” Commuters were pushing past \nthe policeman as he stood outside, speaking on his radio. They were rushing into the station, down into the tunnels, focused on getting home for dinner.\nWithin minutes, many of them would be dead.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   169 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   169 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n170 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\n● ● ●\nAt 7:36, an Underground worker roped off entry to the Piccadilly \nescalator and another started diverting people to a different stair-way. New trains were arriving every few minutes. The platforms where passengers exited subway cars were crowded. A bottleneck started building at the bottom of an open staircase.\nHayes, the safety inspector, went into a passageway that led to \nthe Piccadilly escalator’s machine room. In the dark, there was a set of controls for a sprinkler system speciﬁ  cally designed to ﬁ  ght ﬁ  res \non escalators. It had been installed years earlier, after a ﬁ  re in an-\nother station had led to a series of dire reports about the risks of a sudden blaze. More than two dozen studies and reprimands had said that the Underground was unprepared for ﬁ  res, and that staff \nneeded to be trained in how to use sprinklers and ﬁ  re extinguishers, \nwhich were positioned on every train platform. Two years earlier the deputy assistant chief of the London Fire Brigade had written to the operations director for railways, complaining about subway work-ers’",

The trains ran on time because all nineteen thousand Underground employees cooperated in a delicate system that passed passengers and trains among  dozens— sometimes  hundreds— of hands all day long. But that co-operation depended upon a balance of power between each of the four departments and all their lieutenants that, itself, relied upon thousands of habits that employees adhered to. These habits created a truce among the Four Barons and their deputies. And from that truce arose policies that told Brickell: Looking for ﬁ  res isn ’t your job. \nDon ’t overstep your bounds.\n“Even at the highest level, one director was unlikely to trespass \non the territory of another,” an investigator would later note. “Thus, \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   168 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   168 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Power of a Crisis ● 169\nthe engineering director did not concern himself with whether the \noperating staff were properly trained in ﬁ  re safety and evacuation \nprocedures because he considered those matters to be the province of the Operations Directorate.”\nSo Brickell didn ’t say anything about the burning tissue.

In this case, the tissue was a stray  warning— a bit of fuel that had escaped from a larger, hidden  blaze— that would show how perilous even perfectly balanced truces can become if they aren ’t designed just right.\nFifteen minutes after Brickell returned to his booth, another pas-\nsenger noticed a wisp of smoke as he rode up the Piccadilly escala-tor; he mentioned it to an Underground employee. The King’s Cross safety inspector, Christopher Hayes, was eventually roused to inves-tigate. A third passenger, seeing smoke and a glow from underneath the escalator’s stairs, hit an emergency stop button and began shout-ing at passengers to exit the escalator. A policeman saw a slight smoky haze inside the escalator’s long tunnel, and, halfway down, ﬂ ames beginning to dart above the steps.\nYet the safety inspector, Hayes, didn ’t call the London Fire Bri-\ngade.

He hadn ’t seen any smoke himself, and another of the Under-ground’s unwritten rules was that the ﬁ  re department should never \nbe contacted unless absolutely necessary. The policeman who had noticed the haze, however, ﬁ  gured he should contact headquarters. \nHis radio didn ’t work underground, so he walked up a long staircase into the outdoors and called his superiors, who eventually passed word to the ﬁ  re department. At 7:36 \nP.M.— twenty- two minutes after \nBrickell was alerted to the ﬂ  aming  tissue— the ﬁ  re brigade received \na call: “Small ﬁ  re at King’s Cross.” Commuters were pushing past \nthe policeman as he stood outside, speaking on his radio. They were rushing into the station, down into the tunnels, focused on getting home for dinner.\nWithin minutes, many of them would be dead.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   169 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   169 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n170 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\n● ● ●\nAt 7:36, an Underground worker roped off entry to the Piccadilly \nescalator and another started diverting people to a different stair-way. New trains were arriving every few minutes. The platforms where passengers exited subway cars were crowded. A bottleneck started building at the bottom of an open staircase.\nHayes, the safety inspector, went into a passageway that led to \nthe Piccadilly escalator’s machine room. In the dark, there was a set of controls for a sprinkler system speciﬁ  cally designed to ﬁ  ght ﬁ  res \non escalators.

He hadn ’t seen any smoke himself, and another of the Under-ground’s unwritten rules was that the ﬁ  re department should never \nbe contacted unless absolutely necessary. The policeman who had noticed the haze, however, ﬁ  gured he should contact headquarters. \nHis radio didn ’t work underground, so he walked up a long staircase into the outdoors and called his superiors, who eventually passed word to the ﬁ  re department. At 7:36 \nP.M.— twenty- two minutes after \nBrickell was alerted to the ﬂ  aming  tissue— the ﬁ  re brigade received \na call: “Small ﬁ  re at King’s Cross.” Commuters were pushing past \nthe policeman as he stood outside, speaking on his radio. They were rushing into the station, down into the tunnels, focused on getting home for dinner.\nWithin minutes, many of them would be dead.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd",

Two years earlier the deputy assistant chief of the London Fire Brigade had written to the operations director for railways, complaining about subway work-ers’ safety habits.\n“I am gravely concerned,” the letter read. “I cannot urge too \nstrongly that . . . clear instructions be given that on any suspicion of ﬁ re, the Fire Brigade be called without delay. This could save lives.”\nHowever, Hayes, the safety inspector never saw that letter be-\ncause it was sent to a separate division from the one he worked within, and the Underground’s policies were never rewritten to re-ﬂ ect the warning. No one inside King’s Cross understood how to \nuse the escalator sprinkler system or was authorized to use the ex-tinguishers, because another department controlled them. Hayes completely forgot the sprinkler system existed. The truces ruling the Underground made sure everyone knew their place, but they left no room for learning about anything outside what you were as-signed to know. Hayes ran past the sprinkler controls without so much as a glance.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   170 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   170 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Power of a Crisis ● 171\nWhen he reached the machine room, he was nearly overcome by \nheat. The ﬁ  re was already too big to ﬁ  ght. He ran back to the main \nhall. There was a line of people standing at the ticket machines and hundreds of people milling about the room, walking to platforms or leaving the station. Hayes found a policeman.\n“We’ve got to stop the trains and get everyone out of here,” he \ntold him. “The ﬁ  re is out of control. It’s going everywhere.”\nAt 7:42— almost a half hour after the burning  tissue— the ﬁ  rst \nﬁ reman arrived at King’s Cross. As he entered the ticketing hall he \nsaw dense black smoke starting to snake along the ceiling. The esca-lator’s rubber handrails had begun to burn. As the acrid smell of burning rubber spread, commuters in the ticketing hall began to recognize that something was wrong. They moved toward the exits as ﬁ remen waded through the crowd, ﬁ  ghting against the tide.\nBelow, the ﬁ  re was spreading. The entire escalator was now \naﬂ ame, producing a superheated gas that rose to the top of the shaft, \nenclosing the escalator, where it was trapped against the tunnel’s ceiling, which was covered with about twenty layers of old paint. A few years earlier, the Underground’s director of operations had sug-gested that all this paint might pose a ﬁ  re hazard. Perhaps, he said, \nthe old layers should be removed before a new one is applied?\nPainting protocols were not in his purview, however. Paint re-\nsponsibility resided with the maintenance department, whose chief politely thanked his colleague for the recommendation, and then noted that if he wanted to interfere with other departments, the favor would be swiftly returned.\nThe director of operations withdrew his recommendation.As the superheated gases pooled along the ceiling of the escala-\ntor shaft, all those old layers of paint began absorbing the warmth. As each new train arrived, it pushed a fresh gust of oxygen into the station, feeding the ﬁ  re like a bellows.\nAt 7:43 \nP.M., a train arrived and a salesman named Mark Silver \nexited. He knew immediately that something was wrong. The air \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   171 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   171 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n172 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nwas hazy, the platform packed with people. Smoke wafted around \nwhere he was standing, curling around the train cars as they sat on the tracks. He turned to reenter the train, but the doors had closed. He hammered on the windows, but there was an unofﬁ  cial policy to \navoid tardiness: Once the doors were sealed, they did not open again. Up and down the platform, Silver and other passengers screamed at the driver to open the doors. The signal light changed to green, and the train pulled away. One woman jumped on the tracks, running after the train as it moved into the tunnel. “Let me in!” she screamed.\nSilver walked down the platform,",

Two years earlier the deputy assistant chief of the London Fire Brigade had written to the operations director for railways, complaining about subway work-ers’ safety habits.\n“I am gravely concerned,” the letter read. “I cannot urge too \nstrongly that . . . clear instructions be given that on any suspicion of ﬁ re, the Fire Brigade be called without delay.

Hayes found a policeman.\n“We’ve got to stop the trains and get everyone out of here,” he \ntold him. “The ﬁ  re is out of control. It’s going everywhere.”\nAt 7:42— almost a half hour after the burning  tissue— the ﬁ  rst \nﬁ reman arrived at King’s Cross. As he entered the ticketing hall he \nsaw dense black smoke starting to snake along the ceiling. The esca-lator’s rubber handrails had begun to burn.

Two years earlier the deputy assistant chief of the London Fire Brigade had written to the operations director for railways, complaining about subway work-ers’ safety habits.\n“I am gravely concerned,” the letter read. “I cannot urge too \nstrongly that . . . clear instructions be given that on any suspicion of ﬁ re, the Fire Brigade be called without delay. This could save lives.”\nHowever, Hayes, the safety inspector never saw that letter be-\ncause it was sent to a separate division from the one he worked within, and the Underground’s policies were never rewritten to re-ﬂ ect the warning. No one inside King’s Cross understood how to \nuse the escalator sprinkler system or was authorized to use the ex-tinguishers, because another department controlled them. Hayes completely forgot the sprinkler system existed. The truces ruling the Underground made sure everyone knew their place, but they left no room for learning about anything outside what you were as-signed to know. Hayes ran past the sprinkler controls without so much as a glance.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   170",

As the acrid smell of burning rubber spread, commuters in the ticketing hall began to recognize that something was wrong. They moved toward the exits as ﬁ remen waded through the crowd, ﬁ  ghting against the tide.\nBelow, the ﬁ  re was spreading. The entire escalator was now \naﬂ ame, producing a superheated gas that rose to the top of the shaft, \nenclosing the escalator, where it was trapped against the tunnel’s ceiling, which was covered with about twenty layers of old paint. A few years earlier, the Underground’s director of operations had sug-gested that all this paint might pose a ﬁ  re hazard. Perhaps, he said, \nthe old layers should be removed before a new one is applied?\nPainting protocols were not in his purview, however. Paint re-\nsponsibility resided with the maintenance department, whose chief politely thanked his colleague for the recommendation, and then noted that if he wanted to interfere with other departments, the favor would be swiftly returned.\nThe director of operations withdrew his recommendation.As the superheated gases pooled along the ceiling of the escala-\ntor shaft, all those old layers of paint began absorbing the warmth. As each new train arrived, it pushed a fresh gust of oxygen into the station, feeding the ﬁ  re like a bellows.\nAt 7:43 \nP.M., a train arrived and a salesman named Mark Silver \nexited. He knew immediately that something was wrong. The air \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   171 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   171 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n172 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nwas hazy, the platform packed with people. Smoke wafted around \nwhere he was standing, curling around the train cars as they sat on the tracks. He turned to reenter the train, but the doors had closed. He hammered on the windows, but there was an unofﬁ  cial policy to \navoid tardiness: Once the doors were sealed, they did not open again. Up and down the platform, Silver and other passengers screamed at the driver",

One woman jumped on the tracks, running after the train as it moved into the tunnel. “Let me in!” she screamed.\nSilver walked down the platform, to where a policeman was di-\nrecting everyone away from the Piccadilly escalator and to another stairway. There were crowds of panicked people waiting to get up-stairs. They could all smell the smoke, and everyone was packed to-gether. It felt  hot— either from the ﬁ  re or the crush of people, Silver \nwasn ’t sure. He ﬁ  nally got to the bottom of an escalator that had \nbeen turned off. As he climbed toward the ticketing hall, he could feel his legs burning from heat coming through a  ﬁ  fteen- foot wall \nseparating him from the Piccadilly shaft. “I looked up and saw the walls and ceiling sizzling,” he later said.\nAt 7:45 \nP.M., an arriving train forced a large gust of air into the \nstation. As the oxygen fed the ﬁ  re, the blaze in the Piccadilly escala-\ntor roared. The superheated gases along the ceiling of the shaft, fu-eled by ﬁ  re below and sizzling paint above, reached a combustion \ntemperature, what is known as a “ﬂ  ashover point.” At that moment, \neverything inside the  shaft— the paint, the wooden escalator stairs, and any other available  fuel— ignited in a ﬁ  ery blast. The force of the \nsudden incineration acted in the same way as the explosion of gun-powder at the base of a riﬂ  e barrel. It began pushing the ﬁ  re upward \nthrough the long shaft, absorbing more heat and velocity as the blaze expanded until it shot out of the tunnel and into the ticketing hall in a wall of ﬂ  ames that set metal, tile, and ﬂ  esh on ﬁ  re. The \ntemperature inside the hall shot up 150 degrees in half a second.

A policeman who was enter-ing the ticketing hall as the explosion occurred later told reporters, from a hospital bed, that “a ﬁ  reball hit me in the face and knocked \nme off my feet. My hands caught ﬁ  re. They were just melting.”\nHe was one of the last people to exit the hall alive.Shortly after the explosion, dozens of ﬁ  re trucks arrived. But be-\ncause the ﬁ  re department’s rules instructed them to connect their \nhoses to  street- level hydrants, rather than those installed by the Un-derground inside the station, and because none of the subway em-ployees had blueprints showing the station ’s  layout— all the plans were in an ofﬁ  ce that was locked, and none of the ticketing agents or \nthe station manager had  keys— it took hours to extinguish the ﬂ ames.\nWhen the blaze was ﬁ  nally put out at 1:46 \nA.M.—six hours after \nthe burning tissue was  noticed— the toll stood at  thirty- one dead and dozens injured.\n“Why did they send me straight into the ﬁ  re?” a  twenty- year- old \nmusic teacher asked the next day from a hospital bed. “I could see them burning. I could hear them screaming. Why didn ’t someone take charge?”\n● ● ●\nTo answer those questions, consider a few of the truces the London Underground relied upon to function:\nTicketing clerks were warned that their jurisdiction was strictly \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   173 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd  ",

One woman jumped on the tracks, running after the train as it moved into the tunnel. “Let me in!” she screamed.\nSilver walked down the platform, to where a policeman was di-\nrecting everyone away from the Piccadilly escalator and to another stairway. There were crowds of panicked people waiting to get up-stairs. They could all smell the smoke, and everyone was packed to-gether. It felt  hot— either from the ﬁ  re or the crush of people, Silver \nwasn ’t sure. He ﬁ  nally got to the bottom of an escalator that had \nbeen turned off. As he climbed toward the ticketing hall, he could feel his legs burning from heat coming through a  ﬁ  fteen- foot wall \nseparating him from the Piccadilly shaft. “I looked up and saw the walls and ceiling sizzling,” he later said.\nAt 7:45 \nP.M., an arriving train forced a large gust of air into the \nstation. As the oxygen fed the ﬁ  re, the blaze in the Piccadilly escala-\ntor roared. The superheated gases along the ceiling of the shaft, fu-eled by ﬁ  re below and sizzling paint above, reached a combustion \ntemperature, what is known as a “ﬂ  ashover point.” At that moment, \neverything inside the  shaft— the paint, the wooden escalator stairs, and any other available  fuel— ignited in a ﬁ  ery blast. The force of the \nsudden incineration acted in the same way as the explosion of gun-powder at the base of a riﬂ  e barrel. It began pushing the ﬁ  re upward \nthrough the long shaft, absorbing more heat and velocity as the blaze expanded until it shot out of the tunnel and into the ticketing hall in a wall of ﬂ  ames that set metal, tile, and ﬂ  esh on ﬁ  re. The \ntemperature inside the hall shot up 150 degrees in half a second. A \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   172 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   172 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/",

A policeman who was enter-ing the ticketing hall as the explosion occurred later told reporters, from a hospital bed, that “a ﬁ  reball hit me in the face and knocked \nme off my feet. My hands caught ﬁ  re. They were just melting.”\nHe was one of the last people to exit the hall alive.Shortly after the explosion, dozens of ﬁ  re trucks arrived. But be-\ncause the ﬁ  re department’s rules instructed them to connect their \nhoses to  street- level hydrants, rather than those installed by the Un-derground inside the station, and because none of the subway em-ployees had blueprints showing the station ’s  layout— all the plans were in an ofﬁ  ce that was locked, and none of the ticketing agents or \nthe station manager had  keys— it took hours to extinguish the ﬂ ames.\nWhen the blaze was ﬁ  nally put out at 1:46 \nA.M.—six hours after \nthe burning tissue was  noticed— the toll stood at  thirty- one dead and dozens injured.\n“Why did they send me straight into the ﬁ  re?” a  twenty- year- old \nmusic teacher asked the next day from a hospital bed. “I could see them burning. I could hear them screaming. Why didn ’t someone take charge?”\n● ● ●\nTo answer those questions, consider a few of the truces the London Underground relied upon to function:\n",

For instance, the habits that kept ticketing clerks focused on selling tickets instead of doing anything  else— including keeping an eye out for warning signs of  ﬁ  re— existed \nbecause, years earlier, the Underground had problems with under-staffed kiosks. Clerks kept leaving their posts to pick up trash or point tourists toward their trains, and as a result, long lines would form. So clerks were ordered to stay in their booths, sell tickets, and not worry about anything else. It worked. Lines disappeared. If clerks saw something amiss outside their  kiosks— beyond their scope of  responsibility— they minded their own business.\nAnd the ﬁ  re brigade’s habit of insisting on their own equipment? \nThat was a result of an incident, a decade earlier, when a ﬁ  re had \nraged in another station as ﬁ  remen wasted precious minutes trying \nto hook up their hoses to unfamiliar pipes. Afterward, everyone de-cided it was best to stick with what they knew.\nNone of these routines, in other words, were arbitrary. Each was \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   174 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   174 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Power of a Crisis ● 175\ndesigned for a reason. The Underground was so vast and compli-\ncated that it could operate smoothly only if truces smoothed over potential obstacles. Unlike at Rhode Island Hospital, each truce cre-ated a genuine balance of power. No department had the upper hand.\nYet  thirty- one people died.The London Underground’s routines and truces all seemed logi-\ncal until a ﬁ  re erupted. At which point, an awful truth emerged: No \none person, department, or baron had ultimate responsibility for passengers’ safety.\nSometimes, one  priority— or one department or one person or \none  goal— needs  to overshadow everything else, though it might be \nunpopular or threaten the balance of power that keeps trains run-ning on time. Sometimes, a truce can create dangers that outweigh any peace.\nThere’s a paradox in this observation, of course. How can an or-\nganization implement habits that balance authority and, at the same time, choose a person or goal that rises above everyone else? How do nurses and doctors share authority while still making it clear who is in charge? How does a subway system avoid becoming bogged down in turf battles while making sure safety is still a prior-ity, even if that means lines of authority must be redrawn?\nThe answer lies in seizing the same advantage that Tony Dungy \nencountered when he took over the woeful Bucs and Paul O’Neill discovered when he became CEO of ﬂ  ailing Alcoa. It’s the same op-\nportunity Howard Schultz exploited when he returned to a ﬂ  agging \nStarbucks in 2007. All those leaders seized the possibilities created by a crisis. During turmoil, organizational habits become malleable enough to both assign responsibility and create a more equitable balance of power. Crises are so valuable, in fact, that sometimes it’s worth stirring up a sense of looming catastrophe rather than letting it die down.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   175 Duhi_978",

For instance, the habits that kept ticketing clerks focused on selling tickets instead of doing anything  else— including keeping an eye out for warning signs of  ﬁ  re— existed \nbecause, years earlier, the Underground had problems with under-staffed kiosks. Clerks kept leaving their posts to pick up trash or point tourists toward their trains, and as a result, long lines would form. So clerks were ordered to stay in their booths, sell tickets, and not worry about anything else. It worked. Lines disappeared. If clerks saw something amiss outside their  kiosks— beyond their scope of  responsibility— they minded their own business.\nAnd the ﬁ  re brigade’s habit of insisting on their own equipment? \nThat was a result of an incident, a decade earlier, when a ﬁ  re had \nraged in another station as ﬁ  remen wasted precious minutes trying \nto hook up their hoses to unfamiliar pipes. Afterward, everyone de-cided it was best to stick with what they knew.\nNone of these routines,",

The Underground was so vast and compli-\ncated that it could operate smoothly only if truces smoothed over potential obstacles. Unlike at Rhode Island Hospital, each truce cre-ated a genuine balance of power. No department had the upper hand.\nYet  thirty- one people died.The London Underground’s routines and truces all seemed logi-\ncal until a ﬁ  re erupted. At which point, an awful truth emerged: No \none person, department, or baron had ultimate responsibility for passengers’ safety.\nSometimes, one  priority— or one department or one person or \none  goal— needs  to overshadow everything else, though it might be \nunpopular or threaten the balance of power that keeps trains run-ning on time. Sometimes, a truce can create dangers that outweigh any peace.\nThere’s a paradox in this observation, of course. How can an or-\nganization implement habits that balance authority and, at the same time, choose a person or goal that rises above everyone else? How do nurses and doctors share authority while still making it clear who is in charge? How does a subway system avoid becoming bogged down in turf battles while making sure safety is still a prior-ity, even if that means lines of authority must be redrawn?\nThe answer lies in seizing the same advantage that Tony Dungy \nencountered when he took over the woeful Bucs and Paul O’Neill discovered when he became CEO of ﬂ  ailing Alcoa. It’s the same op-\nportunity Howard Schultz exploited when he returned to a ﬂ  agging \nStarbucks in 2007. All those leaders seized the possibilities created by a crisis. During turmoil, organizational habits become malleable enough to both assign responsibility and create a more equitable balance of power. Crises",

The state’s health department reprimanded the facil-ity and ﬁ  ned it $50,000. Eighteen months later, a surgeon operated \non the wrong part of a child’s mouth during a cleft palate surgery. Five months after that, a surgeon operated on a patient’s wrong ﬁ  n-\nger. Ten months after that, a drill bit was left inside a man ’s head. For these transgressions, the hospital was ﬁ  ned another $450,000.\nRhode Island Hospital is not the only medical institution where \nsuch accidents happen, of course, but they were unlucky enough to become the poster child for such mistakes. Local newspapers printed detailed stories of each incident. Television stations set up camp outside the hospital. The national media joined in, too. “The problem ’s not going away,” a vice president of the national hospital accreditation organization told an Associated Press reporter. Rhode Island Hospital, the state’s medical authorities declared to report-ers, was a facility in chaos.\n“It felt like working in a war zone,” a nurse told me. “There were \nTV reporters ambushing doctors as they walked to their cars. One little boy asked me to make sure the doctor wouldn ’t accidentally cut off his arm during surgery. It felt like everything was out of control.”\nAs critics and the media piled on, a sense of crisis emerged \nwithin the hospital. Some administrators started worrying that the facility would lose its accreditation. Others became defensive, at-tacking the television stations for singling them out. “I found a but-ton that said ‘Scapegoat’ that I was going to wear to work,” one doctor told me. “My wife said that was a bad idea.”\nThen an administrator, Dr. Mary Reich Cooper, who had be-\ncome chief quality ofﬁ  cer a few weeks before the  eighty- six- year- old \nman ’s death, spoke up. In meetings with the hospital’s administra-\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   176 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   176 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Power of a Crisis ● 177\ntors and staff, Cooper said that they were looking at the situation \nall wrong.\nAll this criticism wasn ’t a bad thing, she said. In fact, the hospital \nhad been given an opportunity that few organizations ever received.\n“I saw this as an opening,” Dr. Cooper told me. “There’s a long \nhistory of hospitals trying to attack these problems and failing. Sometimes people need a jolt, and all the bad publicity was a serious  \njolt. It gave us a chance to reexamine everything.”\nRhode Island Hospital shut down all elective surgery units for an \nentire  day— a huge  expense— and put the entire staff through an in-tensive training program that emphasized teamwork and stressed the importance of empowering nurses and medical staff. The chief of neurosurgery resigned and a new leader was selected. The hospi-tal invited the Center for Transforming  Healthcare— a coalition of leading medical  institutions— to help redesign its surgical safe-guards. Administrators installed video cameras in operating rooms to make sure  time- outs occurred and checklists were mandated for every surgery. A computerized system allowed any hospital employee to anonymously report problems that endangered patient health.\nSome of those initiatives had been proposed at Rhode Island \nHospital in previous years, but they had always been struck down. Doctors and nurses didn ’t want people recording their surgeries or other hospitals telling them how to do their jobs.\nBut once a sense of crisis gripped Rhode Island Hospital, every-\none became more open to change.\nOther hospitals have made similar shifts in the wake of mistakes \nand have brought down error rates that just years earlier had seemed immune to improvement. Like Rhode Island Hospital, these insti-tutions have found that reform is usually possible only once a sense of crisis takes hold.

It felt like everything was out of control.”\nAs critics and the media piled on, a sense of crisis emerged \nwithin the hospital. Some administrators started worrying that the facility would lose its accreditation. Others became defensive, at-tacking the television stations for singling them out. “I found a but-ton that said ‘Scapegoat’ that I was going to wear to work,” one doctor told me. “My wife said that was a bad idea.”\nThen an administrator, Dr. Mary Reich Cooper, who had be-\ncome",

In fact, the hospital \nhad been given an opportunity that few organizations ever received.\n“I saw this as an opening,” Dr. Cooper told me. “There’s a long \nhistory of hospitals trying to attack these problems and failing. Sometimes people need a jolt, and all the bad publicity was a serious  \njolt. It gave us a chance to reexamine everything.”\nRhode Island Hospital shut down all elective surgery units for an \nentire  day— a huge  expense— and put the entire staff through an in-tensive training program that emphasized teamwork and stressed the importance of empowering nurses and medical staff. The chief of neurosurgery resigned and a new leader was selected. The hospi-tal invited the Center for Transforming  Healthcare— a coalition of leading medical  institutions— to help redesign its surgical safe-guards. Administrators installed video cameras in operating rooms to make sure  time- outs occurred and checklists were mandated for every surgery. A computerized system allowed any hospital employee to anonymously report problems that endangered patient health.\nSome of those initiatives had been proposed at Rhode Island \nHospital in previous years, but they had always been struck down. Doctors and nurses didn ’t want people recording their surgeries or other hospitals telling them how to do their jobs.\nBut once a sense of crisis gripped Rhode Island Hospital, every-\none became more open to change.\nOther hospitals have made similar shifts in the wake of mistakes \nand have brought down error rates that just years earlier had seemed immune to improvement.

Administrators installed video cameras in operating rooms to make sure  time- outs occurred and checklists were mandated for every surgery. A computerized system allowed any hospital employee to anonymously report problems that endangered patient health.\nSome of those initiatives had been proposed at Rhode Island \nHospital in previous years, but they had always been struck down.

    "text": " that reform is usually possible only once a sense of crisis takes hold. For instance, one of Harvard University’s teach-ing hospitals, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, went through a spate of errors and internal battles in the late 1990s that spilled into newspaper articles and ugly shouting matches between nurses \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   177 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   177 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n178 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nand administrators at public meetings. There was talk among some \nstate ofﬁ  cials of forcing the hospital to close departments until they \ncould prove the mistakes would stop. Then the hospital, under at-tack, coalesced around solutions to change its culture. Part of the answer was “safety rounds,” in which, every three months, a senior physician discussed a particular surgery or diagnosis and described, in painstaking detail, a mistake or near miss to an audience of hun-dreds of her or his peers.\n“It’s excruciating to admit a mistake publicly,” said Dr. Donald \nMoorman, until recently Beth Israel Deaconess’s associate surgeon in chief. “Twenty years ago, doctors wouldn ’t do it. But a real sense of panic has spread through hospitals now, and even the best sur-geons are willing to talk about how close they came to a big error. The culture of medicine is changing.”\n● ● ●\nGood leaders seize crises to remake organizational habits. NASA administrators, for instance, tried for years to improve the agency’s safety habits, but those efforts were unsuccessful until the space shuttle Challenger  exploded in 1986. In the wake of that tragedy, the \norganization was able to overhaul how it enforced quality standards. Airline pilots, too, spent years trying to convince plane manufactur-ers and air trafﬁ  c controllers to redesign how cockpits were laid out \nand trafﬁ  c controllers communicated. Then, a runway error on the \nSpanish island of Tenerife in 1977 killed 583 people and, within ﬁ  ve \nyears, cockpit design, runway procedures, and air trafﬁ  c controller \ncommunication routines were overhauled.\nIn fact, crises are such valuable opportunities that a wise leader \noften prolongs a sense of emergency on purpose. That’s exactly what occurred after the King’s Cross station ﬁ  re. Five days after the \nblaze, the British secretary of state appointed a special investigator, Desmond Fennell, to study the incident. Fennell began by inter-\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   178 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   178 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Power of a Crisis ● 179\nviewing the Underground’s leadership, and quickly discovered that \neveryone had  known— for  years— that ﬁ  re safety was a serious prob-\nlem, and yet nothing had changed. Some administrators had pro-posed new hierarchies that would have clariﬁ  ed responsibility for \nﬁ re prevention. Others had proposed giving station managers more \npower so that they could bridge departmental divides. None of those reforms had been implemented.\nWhen Fennell began suggesting changes of his own, he saw the \nsame kinds of  roadblocks— department chiefs refusing to take re-sponsibility or undercutting him with whispered threats to their  subordinates— start to emerge.\nSo he decided to turn his inquiry into a media circus.He called for public hearings that lasted  ninety- one days and re-\nvealed an organization that had ignored multiple warnings of risks. He implied to newspaper reporters that commuters were in grave danger whenever they rode the subway. He  cross- examined dozens of witnesses who described an organization where turf battles mat-tered more than commuter safety. His ﬁ  nal report, released almost \na year after the ﬁ  re, was a scathing, 250-page indictment of the Un-\nderground portraying an organization crippled by bureaucratic in-eptitude. “Having set out as an Investigation into the events of one night,” Fennell wrote, the report’s “scope was necessarily enlarged into the examination of a system.” He concluded with pages and pages of stinging criticisms and recommendations that, essentially, suggested much of the organization was either incompetent or cor-rupt.\nThe response was instantaneous and overwhelming. Commut-\ners picketed the Underground’s ofﬁ  ces. The organization ’s leader-\nship was ﬁ  red. A slew of new laws were passed and the culture of \nthe Underground was overhauled. Today, every",

    "text": " that reform is usually possible only once a sense of crisis takes hold. For instance, one of Harvard University’s teach-ing hospitals, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, went through a spate of errors and internal battles in the late 1990s that spilled into newspaper articles and ugly shouting matches between nurses \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   177 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   177 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n178 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nand administrators at public meetings. There was talk among some \nstate ofﬁ  cials of forcing the hospital to close departments until they \ncould prove the mistakes would stop. Then the hospital, under at-tack, coalesced around solutions to change its culture. Part of the answer was “safety rounds,” in which, every three months, a senior physician discussed a particular surgery or diagnosis and described, in painstaking detail, a mistake or near miss to an audience of hun-dreds of her or his peers.\n“It’s excruciating to admit a mistake publicly,” said Dr. Donald \nMoorman, until recently Beth Israel Deaconess’s associate surgeon in chief. “Twenty years ago, doctors wouldn ’t do it. But a real sense of panic has spread through hospitals now, and even the best sur-geons are willing to talk about how close they came to a big error. The culture of medicine is changing.”\n● ● ●\nGood leaders seize crises to remake organizational habits. NASA administrators, for instance, tried for years to improve the agency’s safety habits, but those efforts were unsuccessful until the space shuttle Challenger  exploded in 1986. In the wake of that tragedy, the \norganization was able to overhaul how it enforced quality standards. Airline pilots, too, spent years trying to convince plane manufactur-ers and air trafﬁ  c controllers to redesign how cockpits were laid out \nand trafﬁ  c controllers communicated. Then, a runway error on the \nSpanish island of Tenerife in 1977 killed 583 people and, within ﬁ  ve \nyears, cockpit design, runway procedures, and air trafﬁ  c controller \ncommunication routines were overhauled.\nIn fact, crises are such valuable opportunities that a wise leader \noften prolongs a sense of emergency",

That’s exactly what occurred after the King’s Cross station ﬁ  re. Five days after the \nblaze, the British secretary of state appointed a special investigator, Desmond Fennell, to study the incident. Fennell began by inter-\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   178 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   178 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Power of a Crisis ● 179\nviewing the Underground’s leadership, and quickly discovered that \neveryone had  known— for  years— that ﬁ  re safety was a serious prob-\nlem, and yet nothing had changed. Some administrators had pro-posed new hierarchies that would have clariﬁ  ed responsibility for \nﬁ re prevention. Others had proposed giving station managers more \npower so that they could bridge departmental divides. None of those reforms had been implemented.\nWhen Fennell began suggesting changes of his own, he saw the \nsame kinds of  roadblocks— department chiefs refusing to take re-sponsibility or undercutting him with whispered threats to their  subordinates— start to emerge.\nSo he decided to turn his inquiry into a media circus.He called for public hearings that lasted  ninety- one days and re-\nvealed an organization that had ignored multiple warnings of risks. He implied to newspaper reporters that commuters were in grave danger whenever they rode the subway. He  cross- examined dozens of witnesses who described an organization where turf battles mat-tered more than commuter safety.

    "text": " Commut-\ners picketed the Underground’s ofﬁ  ces. The organization ’s leader-\nship was ﬁ  red. A slew of new laws were passed and the culture of \nthe Underground was overhauled. Today, every station has a man-ager whose primary responsibility is passenger safety, and every employee has an obligation to communicate at the smallest hint of risk. All the trains still run on time. But the Underground’s habits \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   179 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   179 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n180 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nand truces have adjusted just enough to make it clear who has ulti-\nmate responsibility for ﬁ  re prevention, and everyone is empowered \nto act, regardless of whose toes they might step on.\nThe same kinds of shifts are possible at any company where in-\nstitutional  habits— through thoughtlessness or  neglect— have cre-ated toxic truces. A company with dysfunctional habits can ’t turn around simply because a leader orders it. Rather, wise executives seek out moments of  crisis— or create the perception of  crisis— and cultivate the sense that something must change,  until everyone is ﬁ  -\nnally ready to overhaul the patterns they live with each day.\n“You never want a serious crisis to go to waste,” Rahm Emanuel \ntold a conference of chief executives in the wake of the 2008 global ﬁ nancial meltdown, soon after he was appointed as President \nObama’s chief of staff. “This crisis provides the opportunity for us to do things that you could not do before.” Soon afterward, the Obama administration convinced a  once- reluctant Congress to pass the president’s $787 billion stimulus plan. Congress also passed Obama’s health care reform law, reworked consumer protection laws, and approved dozens of other statutes, from expanding chil-dren ’s health insurance to giving women new opportunities to sue over wage discrimination. It was one of the biggest policy overhauls since the Great Society and the New Deal, and it happened because, in the aftermath of a ﬁ  nancial catastrophe, lawmakers saw opportu-\nnity.\nSomething similar happened at Rhode Island Hospital in the \nwake of the  eighty- six- year- old man ’s death and the other surgical errors. Since the hospital’s new safety procedures were fully imple-mented in 2009, no  wrong- site errors have occurred. The hospital recently earned a Beacon Award, the most prestigious recognition of critical care nursing, and honors from the American College of Surgeons for the quality of cancer care.\nMore important, say the nurses and doctors who work there, \nRhode Island Hospital feels like a completely different place.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   180 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   180 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Power of a Crisis ● 181\nIn 2010, a young nurse named Allison Ward walked into an op-\nerating room to assist on a routine surgery. She had started working in the OR a year earlier. She was the youngest and least experienced person in the room. Before the surgery began, the entire surgical team gathered over the unconscious patient for a  time- out. The sur-geon read from a checklist, posted on the wall, which detailed every step of the operation.\n“Okay, ﬁ  nal step,” he said before he picked up his scalpel. “Does \nanyone have any concerns before we start?”\nThe doctor had performed hundreds of these surgeries. He had \nan ofﬁ  ce full of degrees and awards.\n“Doctor,” the  twenty- seven- year- old Ward said, “I want to remind \neveryone that we have to pause before the ﬁ  rst and second proce-\ndures. You didn ’t mention that, and I just want to make sure we re-member.”\nIt was the type of comment that, a few years ago, might have \nearned her a rebuke. Or ended her career.\n“Thanks for adding that,” the surgeon said. “I’ll remember to \nmention it next time.\n“Okay,” he said, “let’s start.”“I know this hospital has gone through some hard periods,” \nWard later told me. “But it’s really cooperative now. Our training, all the role  models— the whole culture of the hospital is focused on teamwork. I feel like I can say anything. It’s an amazing place to work.”\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd",

Today, every station has a man-ager whose primary responsibility is passenger safety, and every employee has an obligation to communicate at the smallest hint of risk. All the trains still run on time. But the Underground’s habits \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   179 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   179 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n180 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nand truces have adjusted just enough to make it clear who has ulti-\nmate responsibility for ﬁ  re prevention, and everyone is empowered \nto act, regardless of whose toes they might step on.\nThe same kinds of shifts are possible at any company where in-\nstitutional  habits— through thoughtlessness or  neglect— have cre-ated toxic truces. A company with dysfunctional habits can ’t turn around simply because a leader orders it. Rather, wise executives seek out moments of  crisis— or create the perception of  crisis— and cultivate the sense that something must change,  until everyone is ﬁ  -\nnally ready to overhaul the patterns they live with each day.\n“You never want a serious crisis to go to waste,” Rahm Emanuel \ntold a conference of chief executives in the wake of the 2008 global ﬁ nancial meltdown, soon after he was appointed as President \nObama’s chief of staff. “This crisis provides the opportunity for us to do things that you could not do before.” Soon afterward, the Obama administration convinced a  once- reluctant Congress to pass the president’s $787 billion stimulus plan. Congress also passed Obama’s health care reform law, reworked consumer protection laws, and approved dozens of other statutes, from expanding chil-dren ’s health insurance to giving women new opportunities to sue over wage discrimination. It was one of the biggest policy overhauls since the Great Society and the New Deal, and it happened because, in the aftermath of a ﬁ  nancial catastrophe, lawmakers saw opportu-\nnity.\nSomething similar happened at Rhode Island Hospital in the \nwake of the  eighty- six- year- old man ’s",

    "text": " on.\nThe same kinds of shifts are possible at any company where in-\nstitutional  habits— through thoughtlessness or  neglect— have cre-ated toxic truces. A company with dysfunctional habits can ’t turn around simply because a leader orders it. Rather, wise executives seek out moments of  crisis— or create the perception of  crisis— and cultivate the sense that something must change,  until everyone is ﬁ  -\nnally ready to overhaul the patterns they live with each day.\n“You never want a serious crisis to go to waste,” Rahm Emanuel \ntold a conference of chief executives in the wake of the 2008 global ﬁ nancial meltdown, soon after he was appointed as President \nObama’s chief of staff. “This crisis provides the opportunity for us to do things that you could not do before.” Soon afterward, the Obama administration convinced a  once- reluctant Congress to pass the president’s $787 billion stimulus plan. Congress also passed Obama’s health care reform law, reworked consumer protection laws, and approved dozens of other statutes, from expanding chil-dren ’s health insurance to giving women new opportunities to sue over wage discrimination. It was one of the biggest policy overhauls since the Great Society and the New Deal",

    "text": ", and it happened because, in the aftermath of a ﬁ  nancial catastrophe, lawmakers saw opportu-\nnity.\nSomething similar happened at Rhode Island Hospital in the \nwake of the  eighty- six- year- old man ’s death and the other surgical errors. Since the hospital’s new safety procedures were fully imple-mented in 2009, no  wrong- site errors have occurred. The hospital recently earned a Beacon Award, the most prestigious recognition of critical care nursing, and honors from the American College of Surgeons for the quality of cancer care.\nMore important, say the nurses and doctors who work there, \nRhode Island Hospital feels like a completely different place.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   180 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   180 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Power of a Crisis ● 181\nIn 2010, a young nurse named Allison Ward walked into an op-\nerating room to assist on a routine surgery. She had started working in the OR a year earlier. She was the youngest and least experienced person in the room. Before the surgery began, the entire surgical team gathered over the unconscious patient for a  time- out. The sur-geon read from a checklist, posted on the wall, which detailed every step of the operation.\n“Okay, ﬁ  nal step,” he said before he picked up his scalpel. “Does \nanyone have any concerns before we start?”\nThe doctor had performed hundreds of these surgeries. He had \nan ofﬁ  ce full of degrees and awards.\n“Doctor,” the  twenty- seven- year- old Ward said, “I want to remind \neveryone that we have to pause before the ﬁ  rst and second proce-\ndures. You didn ’t mention that, and I just want to make sure we re-member.”\nIt was the type of comment that, a few years ago, might have \nearned her a rebuke. Or ended her career.\n“Thanks for adding that,” the surgeon said. “I’ll remember to \nmention it next time.\n“Okay,” he said, “let’s start.”“I know this hospital has gone through some hard periods,” \nWard later told me. “But it’s really cooperative now.
