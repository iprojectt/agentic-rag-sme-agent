His family had just moved into a small apartment at the end of an alleyway, the latest in a seemingly endless series of reloca-tions that had most recently caused them to abandon their previous home in the middle of the night, throwing everything they owned into black garbage bags after receiving an eviction notice. Too many people coming and going too late at night, the landlord said. Too much noise.\nSometimes, at his old house, Travis would come home from \nschool and ﬁ  nd the rooms neatly cleaned, leftovers meticulously \nwrapped in the fridge and packets of hot sauce and ketchup in Tupperware containers. He knew this meant his parents had tempo-rarily abandoned heroin for crank and spent the day in a cleaning frenzy. Those usually ended badly. Travis felt safer when the house was messy and his parents were on the couch, their eyes  half- lidded, watching cartoons. There is no chaos at the end of a heroin fog.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   127 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   127 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n128 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nTravis’s father was a gentle man who loved to cook and, except \nfor a stint in the navy, spent his entire life within a few miles of his parents in Lodi, California. Travis’s mother, by the time everyone moved into the alleyway apartment, was in prison for heroin posses-sion and prostitution. His parents were, essentially, functional ad-dicts and the family maintained a veneer of normalcy. They went camping every summer and on most Friday nights attended his sis-ter and brother’s softball games. When Travis was four years old, he went to Disneyland with his dad and was photographed for the ﬁ  rst \ntime in his life, by a Disney employee. The family camera had been sold to a pawn shop years before.\nOn the morning of the overdose, Travis and his brother were play-\ning in the living room on top of blankets they laid out on the ﬂ  oor \neach night for sleeping. Travis’s father was getting ready to make pancakes when he stepped into the bathroom. He was carrying the tube sock that contained his needle, spoon, lighter, and cotton swabs. A few moments later, he came out, opened the refrigerator to get the eggs, and crashed to the ﬂ  oor. When the kids ran around the corner, \ntheir father was convulsing, his face turning blue.\nTravis’s siblings had seen an overdose before and knew the drill. \nHis brother rolled him onto his side. His sister opened his mouth to make sure he wouldn ’t choke on his tongue, and told Travis to run next door, ask to use the neighbor’s phone, and dial 911.\n“My name is Travis, my dad is passed out, and we don ’t know \nwhat happened. He’s not breathing,” Travis lied to the police opera-tor. Even at nine years old, he knew why his father was unconscious. He didn ’t want to say it in front of the neighbor. Three years earlier, one of his dad’s friends had died in their basement after shooting up. When the paramedics had taken the body away, neighbors gawked at Travis and his sister while they held the door open for the gurney. One of the neighbors had a cousin whose son was in his class, and soon everyone in school had known.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   128 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   128 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nStarbucks and the Habit of Success  ● 129\nAfter hanging up the phone, Travis walked to the end of the al-\nleyway and waited for the ambulance. His father was treated at the hospital that morning, charged at the police station in the afternoon, and home again by dinnertime. He made spaghetti. Travis turned ten a few weeks later.\n● ● ●\nWhen Travis was sixteen, he dropped out of high school. “I was tired of being called a faggot,” he said, “tired of people following me home and throwing things at me. Everything seemed really over-whelming. It was easier to quit and go somewhere else.” He moved two hours south, to Fresno, and got a job at a car wash. He was ﬁ  red \nfor insubordination. He got jobs",

His family had just moved into a small apartment at the end of an alleyway, the latest in a seemingly endless series of reloca-tions that had most recently caused them to abandon their previous home in the middle of the night, throwing everything they owned into black garbage bags after receiving an eviction notice. Too many people coming and going too late at night, the landlord said. Too much noise.\nSometimes, at his old house, Travis would come home from \nschool and ﬁ  nd the rooms neatly cleaned, leftovers meticulously \nwrapped in the fridge and packets of hot sauce and ketchup in Tupperware containers. He knew this meant his parents had tempo-rarily abandoned heroin for crank and spent the day in a cleaning frenzy. Those usually ended badly. Travis felt safer when the house was messy and his parents were on the couch, their eyes  half- lidded, watching cartoons. There is no chaos at the end of a heroin fog.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   127 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   127 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n128 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nTravis’s father was a gentle man who loved to cook and, except \nfor a stint in the navy, spent his entire life within a few miles of his parents in Lodi, California. Travis’s mother, by the time everyone moved into the alleyway apartment, was in prison for heroin posses-sion and prostitution. His parents were, essentially, functional ad-dicts and the family maintained a veneer of normalcy. They went camping every summer and on most Friday nights attended his sis-ter and brother’s softball games. When Travis was four years old, he went to Disneyland with his dad and was photographed for the ﬁ  rst \ntime in his life, by a Disney employee. The family camera had been sold to a pawn shop years before.\nOn the morning of the overdose, Travis and his brother were play-\ning in the living room on top of blankets they laid out on the ﬂ  oor \neach night for sleeping. Travis’s father",

His family had just moved into a small apartment at the end of an alleyway, the latest in a seemingly endless series of reloca-tions that had most recently caused them to abandon their previous home in the middle of the night, throwing everything they owned into black garbage bags after receiving an eviction notice. Too many people coming and going too late at night, the landlord said. Too much noise.\nSometimes, at his old house, Travis would come home from \nschool and ﬁ  nd the rooms neatly cleaned, leftovers meticulously \nwrapped in the fridge and packets of hot sauce and ketchup in Tupperware containers. He knew this meant his parents had tempo-rarily abandoned heroin for crank and spent the day in a cleaning frenzy. Those usually ended badly. Travis felt safer when the house was messy and his parents were on the couch, their eyes  half- lidded, watching cartoons. There is no chaos at the end of a heroin fog.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd",

    "text": " to a pawn shop years before.\nOn the morning of the overdose, Travis and his brother were play-\ning in the living room on top of blankets they laid out on the ﬂ  oor \neach night for sleeping. Travis’s father was getting ready to make pancakes when he stepped into the bathroom. He was carrying the tube sock that contained his needle, spoon, lighter, and cotton swabs. A few moments later, he came out, opened the refrigerator to get the eggs, and crashed to the ﬂ  oor. When the kids ran around the corner, \ntheir father was convulsing, his face turning blue.\nTravis’s siblings had seen an overdose before and knew the drill. \nHis brother rolled him onto his side. His sister opened his mouth to make sure he wouldn ’t choke on his tongue, and told Travis to run next door, ask to use the neighbor’s phone, and dial 911.\n“My name is Travis, my dad is passed out, and we don ’t know \nwhat happened. He’s not breathing,” Travis lied to the police opera-tor. Even at nine years old, he knew why his father was unconscious. He didn ’t want to say it in front of the neighbor. Three years earlier, one of his dad’s friends had died in their basement after shooting up. When the paramedics had taken the body away, neighbors gawked at Travis and his sister while they held the door open for the gurney. One of the neighbors had a cousin whose son was in his class, and soon everyone in school had known.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   128 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   128 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nStarbucks and the Habit of Success  ● 129\nAfter hanging up the phone, Travis walked to the end of the al-\nleyway and waited for the ambulance. His father was treated at the hospital that morning, charged at the police station in the afternoon, and home again by dinnertime. He made spaghetti. Travis turned ten a few weeks later.\n● ● ●\nWhen Travis was sixteen, he dropped out of high school. “I was tired of being called a faggot,” he said, “tired of people following me home and throwing things at me.",

Travis’s father was getting ready to make pancakes when he stepped into the bathroom. He was carrying the tube sock that contained his needle, spoon, lighter, and cotton swabs. A few moments later, he came out, opened the refrigerator to get the eggs, and crashed to the ﬂ  oor. When the kids ran around the corner, \ntheir father was convulsing, his face turning blue.\nTravis’s siblings had seen an overdose before and knew the drill. \nHis brother rolled him onto his side. His sister opened his mouth to make sure he wouldn ’t choke on his tongue, and told Travis to run next door, ask to use the neighbor’s phone, and dial 911.\n“My name is Travis, my dad is passed out, and we don ’t know \nwhat happened. He’s not breathing,” Travis lied to the police opera-tor. Even at nine years old, he knew why his father was unconscious. He didn ’t want to say it in front of the neighbor.",

    "text": " Everything seemed really over-whelming. It was easier to quit and go somewhere else.” He moved two hours south, to Fresno, and got a job at a car wash. He was ﬁ  red \nfor insubordination. He got jobs at McDonald’s and Hollywood Video, but when customers were rude—“I wanted ranch dressing,  \nyou moron!”—he would lose control.\n“Get out of my  drive- through!” he shouted at one woman, throw-\ning the chicken nuggets at her car before his manager pulled him inside.\nSometimes he’d get so upset that he would start crying in the \nmiddle of a shift. He was often late, or he’d take a day off for no rea-son. In the morning, he would yell at his reﬂ  ection in the mirror, \norder himself to be better, to suck it up. But he couldn ’t get along with people, and he wasn ’t strong enough to weather the steady drip of criticisms and indignities. When the line at his register would get too long and the manager would shout at him, Travis’s hands would start shaking and he’d feel like he couldn ’t catch his breath. He won-dered if this is what his parents felt like, so defenseless against life, when they started using drugs.\nOne day, a regular customer at Hollywood Video who’d gotten to \nknow Travis a little bit suggested he think about working at Star-bucks. “We’re opening a new store on Fort Washington, and I’m \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   129 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   129 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n130 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\ngoing to be an assistant manager,” the man said. “You should apply.” \nA month later, Travis was a barista on the morning shift.\nThat was six years ago. Today, at  twenty- ﬁ  ve, Travis is the man-\nager of two Starbucks where he oversees forty employees and is re-sponsible for revenues exceeding $2 million per year. His salary is $44,000 and he has a 401(k) and no debt. He’s never late to work. He does not get upset on the job. When one of his employees started crying after a customer screamed at her, Travis took her aside.\n“Your apron is a shield,” he told her. “Nothing anyone says will \never hurt you. You will always be as strong as you want to be.”\nHe picked up that lecture in one of his Starbucks training \ncourses, an education program that began on his ﬁ  rst day and con-\ntinues throughout an employee’s career. The program is sufﬁ  ciently \nstructured that he can earn college credits by completing the mod-ules. The training has, Travis says, changed his life. Starbucks has taught him how to live, how to focus, how to get to work on time, and how to master his emotions. Most crucially, it has taught him willpower.\n“Starbucks is the most important thing that has ever happened \nto me,” he told me. “I owe everything to this company.”\n● ● ●\nFor Travis and thousands of others, Starbucks—like a hnadful of other companies—has succeeded in teaching the kind of life skills that schools, families, and communities have failed to provide. With more than 137,000 current employees and more than one million alumni, Starbucks is now, in a sense, one of the nation ’s largest edu-cators. All of those employees, in their ﬁ  rst year alone, spent at least \nﬁ fty hours in Starbucks classrooms, and dozens more at home with \nStarbucks’ workbooks and talking to the Starbucks mentors as-signed to them.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   130 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   130 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nStarbucks and the Habit of Success  ● 131\nAt the core of that education is an intense focus on an  all- important \nhabit: willpower. Dozens of studies show that willpower is the single most important keystone habit for individual success. In a 2005 study, for instance, researchers from the University of Pennsylvania analyzed 164  eighth- grade students, measuring their IQs and other factors, including how much willpower the students demonstrated, as measured by tests of their  self- discipline.\nStudents who exerted high levels of willpower were more likely to \nearn higher grades in their classes and gain admission into more selective schools.

He was ﬁ  red \nfor insubordination. He got jobs at McDonald’s and Hollywood Video, but when customers were rude—“I wanted ranch dressing,  \nyou moron!”—he would lose control.\n“Get out of my  drive- through!” he shouted at one woman, throw-\ning the chicken nuggets at her car before his manager pulled him inside.\nSometimes he’d get so upset that he would start crying in the \nmiddle of a shift. He was often late, or he’d take a day off for no rea-son. In the morning, he would yell at his reﬂ  ection in the mirror, \norder himself to be better, to suck it up.

Today, at  twenty- ﬁ  ve, Travis is the man-\nager of two Starbucks where he oversees forty employees and is re-sponsible for revenues exceeding $2 million per year. His salary is $44,000 and he has a 401(k) and no debt. He’s never late to work. He does not get upset on the job. When one of his employees started crying after a",

When one of his employees started crying after a customer screamed at her, Travis took her aside.\n“Your apron is a shield,” he told her. “Nothing anyone says will \never hurt you. You will always be as strong as you want to be.”\nHe picked up that lecture in one of his Starbucks training \ncourses, an education program that began on his ﬁ  rst day and con-\ntinues throughout an employee’s career. The program is sufﬁ  ciently \nstructured that he can earn college credits by completing the mod-ules. The training has, Travis says, changed his life. Starbucks has taught him how to live, how to focus, how to get to work on time, and how to master his emotions. Most crucially, it has taught him willpower.\n“Starbucks is the most important thing that has ever happened \nto me,” he told me. “I owe everything to this company.”\n● ● ●\nFor Travis and thousands of others, Starbucks—like a hnadful of other companies—has succeeded in teaching the kind of life skills that schools, families, and communities have failed to provide. With more than 137,000 current employees and more than one million alumni, Starbucks is now, in a sense, one of the nation ’s largest edu-cators. All of those employees, in their ﬁ  rst year alone, spent at least \nﬁ fty hours in Starbucks classrooms, and dozens more at home with \nStarbucks’ workbooks and talking to the Starbucks mentors as-signed to them.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   130 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   130 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nStarbucks and the Habit of Success  ● 131\nAt the core of that education is an intense focus on an  all- important \nhabit: willpower. Dozens of studies show that willpower is the single most important keystone habit for individual success. In a 2005 study, for instance, researchers from the University of Pennsylvania analyzed 164  eighth- grade students, measuring their IQs and other factors,",

When one of his employees started crying after a customer screamed at her, Travis took her aside.\n“Your apron is a shield,” he told her. “Nothing anyone says will \never hurt you. You will always be as strong as you want to be.”\nHe picked up that lecture in one of his Starbucks training \ncourses, an education program that began on his ﬁ  rst day and con-\ntinues throughout an employee’s career. The program is sufﬁ  ciently \nstructured that he can earn college credits by completing the mod-ules. The training has, Travis says, changed his life. Starbucks has taught him how to live, how to focus, how to get to work on time, and how to master his emotions. Most crucially, it has taught him willpower.\n“Starbucks is the most important thing that has ever happened \nto me,” he told me. “I owe everything to this company.”\n● ● ●\nFor Travis and thousands of others, Starbucks—like a hnadful of other companies—has succeeded",

They had fewer absences and spent less time watching television and more hours on homework. “Highly  self- disciplined adolescents outperformed their more impulsive peers on every  academic- performance variable,” the researchers wrote.  “Self- discipline predicted academic performance more robustly than did IQ.  Self- discipline also predicted which students would improve their grades over the course of the school year, whereas IQ did not. . . .  Self- discipline has a bigger effect on academic performance than does intellectual talent.”\nAnd the best way to strengthen willpower and give students a leg \nup, studies indicate, is to make it into a habit. “Sometimes it looks like people with great  self- control aren ’t working  hard— but that’s because they’ve made it automatic,” Angela Duckworth, one of the University of Pennsylvania researchers told me. “Their willpower occurs without them having to think about it.”\nFor Starbucks, willpower is more than an academic curiosity. \nWhen the company began plotting its massive growth strategy in the late 1990s, executives recognized that success required cultivat-ing an environment that justiﬁ  ed paying four dollars for a fancy cup \nof coffee. The company needed to train its employees to deliver a bit of joy alongside lattes and scones. So early on, Starbucks started re-searching how they could teach employees to regulate their emo-tions and marshal their  self- discipline to deliver a burst of pep with \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   131 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   131 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n132 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nevery serving. Unless baristas are trained to put aside their personal \nproblems, the emotions of some employees will inevitably spill into how they treat customers. However, if a worker knows how to re-main focused and disciplined, even at the end of an  eight- hour shift, they’ll deliver the higher class of fast food service that Starbucks customers expect.\nThe company spent millions of dollars developing curriculums \nto train employees on  self- discipline. Executives wrote workbooks that, in effect, serve as guides to how to make willpower a habit in workers’ lives. Those curriculums are, in part, why Starbucks has grown from a sleepy Seattle company into a behemoth with more than seventeen thousand stores and revenues of more than $10 bil-lion a year.\nSo how does Starbucks do it? How do they take people like \n Travis— the son of drug addicts and a high school dropout who couldn ’t muster enough  self- control to hold down a job at  McDonald’s— and teach him to oversee dozens of employees and tens of thousands of dollars in revenue each month? What, pre-cisely, did Travis learn?\nII.\nEveryone who walked into the room where the experiment was being conducted at Case Western Reserve University agreed on one thing: The cookies smelled delicious. They had just come out of the oven and were piled in a bowl, oozing with chocolate chips. On the table next to the cookies was a bowl of radishes. All day long, hungry students walked in, sat in front of the two foods, and submitted, unknowingly, to a test of their willpower that would upend our un-derstanding of how  self- discipline works.\nAt the time, there was relatively little academic scrutiny into will-\npower. Psychologists considered such subjects to be aspects of \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   132 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   132 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nStarbucks and the Habit of Success  ● 133\nsomething they called  “self- regulation,” but it wasn ’t a ﬁ  eld that in-\nspired great curiosity. There was one famous experiment, conducted in the 1960s, in which scientists at Stanford had tested the willpower of a group of  four- year- olds. The kids were brought into a room and presented with a selection of treats, including marshmallows. They were offered a deal: They could eat one marshmallow right away, or, if they waited a few minutes, they could have two marshmallows. Then the researcher left the room. Some kids gave in to temptation and ate the marshmallow as soon as the adult left. About 30 percent managed to ignore their urges",

They had fewer absences and spent less time watching television and more hours on homework. “Highly  self- disciplined adolescents outperformed their more impulsive peers on every  academic- performance variable,” the researchers wrote.  “Self- discipline predicted academic performance more robustly than did IQ.  Self- discipline also predicted which students would improve their grades over the course of the school year, whereas IQ did not. . . .  Self- discipline has a bigger effect on academic performance than does intellectual talent.”\nAnd the best way to strengthen willpower and give students a leg \nup, studies indicate, is to make it into a habit. “Sometimes it looks like people with great  self- control aren ’t working  hard— but that’s because they’ve made it automatic,” Angela Duckworth, one of the University of Pennsylvania researchers told me. “Their willpower occurs without them having to think about it.”\nFor Starbucks, willpower is more than an academic curiosity. \nWhen the company began plotting its massive growth strategy in the late 1990s, executives recognized that success required cultivat-ing an environment that justiﬁ  ed paying four dollars for a fancy cup \nof coffee.

They had fewer absences and spent less time watching television and more hours on homework. “Highly  self- disciplined adolescents outperformed their more impulsive peers on every  academic- performance variable,” the researchers wrote.  “Self- discipline predicted academic performance more robustly than did IQ.  Self- discipline also predicted which students would improve their grades over the course of the school year, whereas IQ did not. . . .  Self- discipline has a bigger effect on academic performance than does intellectual talent.”\nAnd the best way to strengthen willpower and give students a leg \nup, studies indicate, is to make it into a habit. “Sometimes it looks like people with great  self- control aren ’t working  hard— but that’s because they’ve made it automatic,” Angela Duckworth, one of the University of Pennsylvania researchers told me. “Their willpower occurs without them having to think about it.”\nFor Starbucks, willpower is more than an academic curiosity. \nWhen the company began plotting its massive growth",

Executives wrote workbooks that, in effect, serve as guides to how to make willpower a habit in workers’ lives. Those curriculums are, in part, why Starbucks has grown from a sleepy Seattle company into a behemoth with more than seventeen thousand stores and revenues of more than $10 bil-lion a year.\nSo how does Starbucks do it? How do they take people like \n Travis— the son of drug addicts and a high school dropout who couldn ’t muster enough  self- control to hold down a job at  McDonald’s— and teach him to oversee dozens of employees and tens of thousands of dollars in revenue each month? What, pre-cisely, did Travis learn?\nII.\nEveryone who walked into the room where the experiment was being conducted at Case Western Reserve University agreed on one thing: The cookies smelled delicious. They had just come out of the oven and were piled in a bowl, oozing with chocolate chips. On the table next to the cookies was a bowl of radishes. All day long, hungry students walked in, sat in front of the two foods, and submitted, unknowingly, to a test of their willpower that would upend our un-derstanding of how  self- discipline works.\nAt the time, there was relatively little academic scrutiny into will-\npower. Psychologists considered such subjects to be aspects of \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   132 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   132 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nStarbucks and the Habit of Success  ● 133\nsomething they called  “self- regulation,” but it wasn ’t a ﬁ  eld that in-\nspired great curiosity. There was one famous experiment, conducted in the 1960s, in which scientists at Stanford had tested the willpower of a group of  four- year- olds. The kids were brought into a room and presented with a selection of treats, including marshmallows. They were offered a deal: They could eat one marshmallow right away, or",

They were offered a deal: They could eat one marshmallow right away, or, if they waited a few minutes, they could have two marshmallows. Then the researcher left the room. Some kids gave in to temptation and ate the marshmallow as soon as the adult left. About 30 percent managed to ignore their urges",

    "text": ", if they waited a few minutes, they could have two marshmallows. Then the researcher left the room. Some kids gave in to temptation and ate the marshmallow as soon as the adult left. About 30 percent managed to ignore their urges, and doubled their treats when the researcher came back ﬁ  fteen minutes later. Scientists, who were \nwatching everything from behind a  two- way mirror, kept careful track of which kids had enough  self- control to earn the second marshmallow.\nYears later, they tracked down many of the study’s participants. \nBy now, they were in high school. The researchers asked about their grades and SAT scores, ability to maintain friendships, and their capacity to “cope with important problems.” They discovered that the  four- year- olds who could delay gratiﬁ  cation the longest ended up \nwith the best grades and with SAT scores 210 points higher, on aver-age, than everyone else. They were more popular and did fewer drugs. If you knew how to avoid the temptation of a marshmallow as a preschooler, it seemed, you also knew how to get yourself to class on time and ﬁ  nish your homework once you got older, as well \nas how to make friends and resist peer pressure. It was as if the  marshmallow- ignoring kids had  self- regulatory skills that gave them an advantage throughout their lives.\nScientists began conducting related experiments, trying to ﬁ  gure \nout how to help kids increase their  self- regulatory skills. They learned that teaching them simple  tricks— such as distracting themselves by drawing a picture, or imagining a frame around the marshmallow, so it seemed more like a photo and less like a real \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   133 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   133 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n134 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\n temptation— helped them learn  self- control. By the 1980s, a theory \nemerged that became generally accepted: Willpower is a learnable skill, something that can be taught the same way kids learn to do math and say “thank you.” But funding for these inquiries was scarce. The topic of willpower wasn ’t in vogue. Many of the Stanford scientists moved on to other areas of research.\nHowever, when a group of psychology PhD candidates at Case \n Western— including one named Mark  Muraven— discovered those studies in the mid-nineties, they started asking questions the previ-Routine\nReward\nWHEN KIDS LEARN HABITS FOR \nDELAYING THEIR CRAVINGS...Cue\nCueCRAVING FOR \nMARSHMALLOWS\nRoutine\nReward\n...

To Muraven, this model of \n willpower- as- skill wasn ’t a satisfying explanation. A skill, after all, is something that remains constant from day to day. If you have the skill to make an omelet on Wednesday, you’ll still know how to make it on Friday.\nIn Muraven ’s experience, though, it felt like he forgot how to \nexert willpower all the time. Some evenings he would come home from work and have no problem going for a jog. Other days, he couldn ’t do anything besides lie on the couch and watch television. It was as if his  brain— or, at least, that part of his brain responsible for making him  exercise— had forgotten how to summon the will-power to push him out the door. Some days, he ate healthily. Other days, when he was tired, he raided the vending machines and stuffed himself with candy and chips.\nIf willpower is a skill, Muraven wondered, then why doesn ’t it \nremain constant from day to day? He suspected there was more to willpower than the earlier experiments had revealed. But how do you test that in a laboratory?\n● ● ●\nMuraven ’s solution was the lab containing one bowl of freshly baked cookies and one bowl of radishes. The room was essentially a closet with a  two- way mirror, outﬁ  tted with a table, a wooden chair, a hand \nbell, and a toaster oven.",

About 30 percent managed to ignore their urges, and doubled their treats when the researcher came back ﬁ  fteen minutes later. Scientists, who were \nwatching everything from behind a  two- way mirror, kept careful track of which kids had enough  self- control to earn the second marshmallow.\nYears later, they tracked down many of the study’s participants. \nBy now, they were in high school. The researchers asked about their grades and SAT scores, ability to maintain friendships, and their capacity to “cope with important problems.” They discovered that the  four- year- olds who could delay gratiﬁ  cation the longest ended up \nwith the best grades and with SAT scores 210 points higher, on aver-age, than everyone else. They were more popular and did fewer drugs. If you knew how to avoid the temptation of a marshmallow as a preschooler, it seemed, you also knew how to get yourself to class on time and ﬁ  nish your homework once you got older, as well \nas how to make friends and resist peer pressure. It was as if the  marshmallow- ignoring kids had  self- regulatory skills that gave them an advantage throughout their lives.\nScientists began conducting related experiments, trying to ﬁ  gure \nout how to help kids increase their  self- regulatory skills. They learned that teaching them simple  tricks— such as distracting themselves by drawing a picture, or imagining a frame around the marshmallow, so it seemed more like a photo and less like a real \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   133 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   133 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n134 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\n temptation— helped them learn  self- control. By the 1980s, a theory \nemerged that became generally accepted: Willpower is a learnable skill, something that can be taught the same way kids learn to do math and say “thank you.” But funding for these inquiries was scarce. The topic of willpower wasn ’t in vogue. Many of the Stanford scientists moved on",

    "text": ", if they waited a few minutes, they could have two marshmallows. Then the researcher left the room. Some kids gave in to temptation and ate the marshmallow as soon as the adult left. About 30 percent managed to ignore their urges, and doubled their treats when the researcher came back ﬁ  fteen minutes later. Scientists, who were \nwatching everything from behind a  two- way mirror, kept careful track of which kids had enough  self- control to earn the second marshmallow.\nYears later, they tracked down many of the study’s participants. \nBy now, they were in high school. The researchers asked about their grades and SAT scores, ability to maintain friendships, and their capacity to “cope with important problems.” They discovered that the  four- year- olds who could delay gratiﬁ  cation the longest ended up \nwith the best grades and with SAT scores 210 points higher, on aver-age, than everyone else. They were more popular and did fewer drugs. If you knew how to avoid the temptation of a marshmallow as a preschooler, it seemed, you also knew how to get yourself to class on time and ﬁ  nish your homework once you got older, as well \nas how",

The topic of willpower wasn ’t in vogue.

To Muraven, this model of \n willpower- as- skill wasn ’t a satisfying explanation. A skill, after all, is something that remains constant from day to day. If you have the skill to make an omelet on Wednesday, you’ll still know how to make it on Friday.\nIn Muraven ’s experience, though, it felt like he forgot how to \nexert willpower all the time. Some evenings he would come home from work and have no problem going for a jog. Other days, he couldn ’t do anything besides lie on the couch and watch television. It was as if his  brain— or, at least, that part of his brain responsible for making him  exercise— had forgotten how to summon the will-power to push him out the door. Some days, he ate healthily. Other days, when he was tired, he raided the vending machines and stuffed himself with candy and chips.\nIf willpower is a skill, Muraven wondered, then why doesn ’t it \nremain constant from day to day? He suspected there was more to willpower than the earlier experiments had revealed. But how do you test that in a laboratory?\n● ● ●\nMuraven ’s solution was the lab containing one",

    "text": " bowl of freshly baked cookies and one bowl of radishes. The room was essentially a closet with a  two- way mirror, outﬁ  tted with a table, a wooden chair, a hand \nbell, and a toaster oven.  Sixty- seven undergraduates were recruited and told to skip a meal. One by one, the undergrads sat in front of the two bowls.\n“The point of this experiment is to test taste perceptions,” a re-\nsearcher told each student, which was untrue. The point was to force  students— but only some  students— to exert their willpower. To \nthat end, half the undergraduates were instructed to eat the cookies and ignore the radishes; the other half were told to eat the radishes and ignore the cookies. Muraven ’s theory was that ignoring cookies \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   135 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   135 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n136 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nis  hard— it takes willpower. Ignoring radishes, on the other hand, \nhardly requires any effort at all.\n“Remember,” the researcher said, “eat only the food that has \nbeen assigned to you.” Then she left the room.\nOnce the students were alone, they started munching. The cookie \neaters were in heaven. The radish eaters were in agony. They were miserable forcing themselves to ignore the warm cookies. Through the  two- way mirror, the researchers watched one of the radish eaters pick up a cookie, smell it longingly, and then put it back in the bowl. Another grabbed a few cookies, put them down, and then licked melted chocolate off his ﬁ  ngers.\nAfter ﬁ  ve minutes, the researcher reentered the room. By Mu-\nraven ’s estimation, the radish eaters’ willpower had been thoroughly taxed by eating the bitter vegetable and ignoring the treats; the cookie eaters had hardly used any of their  self- discipline.\n“We need to wait about ﬁ  fteen minutes for the sensory memory of \nthe food you ate to fade,” the researcher told each participant. To pass the time, she asked them to complete a puzzle. It looked fairly simple: trace a geometric pattern without lifting your pencil from the page or going over the same line twice. If you want to quit, the researcher said, ring the bell. She implied the puzzle wouldn ’t take long.\nIn truth, the puzzle was impossible to solve.This puzzle wasn ’t a way to pass time; it was the most important \npart of the experiment. It took enormous willpower to keep working on the puzzle, particularly when each attempt failed. The scientists wondered, would the students who had already expended their will-power by ignoring the cookies give up on the puzzle faster? In other words, was willpower a ﬁ  nite resource?\nFrom behind their  two- way mirror, the researchers watched. The \ncookie eaters, with their unused reservoirs of  self- discipline, started working on the puzzle. In general, they looked relaxed. One of them tried a straightforward approach, hit a roadblock, and then started again. And again. And again. Some worked for over half an hour \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   136 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   136 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nStarbucks and the Habit of Success  ● 137\nbefore the researcher told them to stop. On average, the cookie eat-\ners spent almost nineteen minutes apiece trying to solve the puzzle before they rang the bell.\nThe radish eaters, with their depleted willpower, acted completely \ndifferent. They muttered as they worked. They got frustrated. One complained that the whole experiment was a waste of time. Some of them put their heads on the table and closed their eyes. One snapped at the researcher when she came back in. On average, the radish eaters worked for only about eight minutes, 60 percent less time than the cookie eaters, before quitting. When the researcher asked afterward how they felt, one of the radish eaters said he was “sick of this dumb experiment.”\n“By making people use a little bit of their willpower to ignore \ncookies, we had put them into a state where they were willing to quit much faster,” Muraven told me. “There’s been more than two hun-dred studies on this idea since then, and they’ve all found the same thing. Willpower isn ’t just a skill. It’s a muscle, like the",

The room was essentially a closet with a  two- way mirror, outﬁ  tted with a table, a wooden chair, a hand \nbell, and a toaster oven.  Sixty- seven undergraduates were recruited and told to skip a meal. One by one, the undergrads sat in front of the two bowls.\n“The point of this experiment is to test taste perceptions,” a re-\nsearcher told each student, which was untrue. The point was to force  students— but only some  students— to exert their willpower. To \nthat end, half the undergraduates were instructed to eat the cookies and ignore the radishes; the other half were told to eat the radishes and ignore the cookies. Muraven ’s theory was that ignoring cookies \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   135 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   135 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n136 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nis  hard— it takes willpower. Ignoring radishes, on the other hand, \nhardly requires any effort at all.\n“Remember,” the researcher said, “eat only the food that has \nbeen assigned to you.” Then she left the room.\nOnce the students were alone, they started munching. The cookie \neaters were in heaven. The radish eaters were in agony. They were miserable forcing themselves to ignore the warm cookies. Through the  two- way mirror, the researchers watched one of the radish eaters pick up a cookie, smell it longingly, and then put it back in the bowl. Another grabbed a few cookies, put them down, and then licked melted chocolate off his ﬁ  ngers.\nAfter ﬁ  ve minutes, the researcher reentered the room. By Mu-\nraven ’s estimation, the radish eaters’ willpower had been thoroughly taxed by eating the bitter vegetable and ignoring the treats; the cookie eaters had hardly used any of their  self- discipline.\n“We need to wait about ﬁ  fteen minutes for the sensory memory of \nthe food you ate to fade,” the researcher told each participant. To pass the time, she asked them to complete a puzzle. It looked fairly simple: trace a geometric pattern without",

    "text": " wait about ﬁ  fteen minutes for the sensory memory of \nthe food you ate to fade,” the researcher told each participant. To pass the time, she asked them to complete a puzzle. It looked fairly simple: trace a geometric pattern without lifting your pencil from the page or going over the same line twice. If you want to quit, the researcher said, ring the bell. She implied the puzzle wouldn ’t take long.\nIn truth, the puzzle was impossible to solve.This puzzle wasn ’t a way to pass time; it was the most important \npart of the experiment. It took enormous willpower to keep working on the puzzle, particularly when each attempt failed. The scientists wondered, would the students who had already expended their will-power by ignoring the cookies give up on the puzzle faster? In other words, was willpower a ﬁ  nite resource?\nFrom behind their  two- way mirror, the researchers watched. The \ncookie eaters, with their unused reservoirs of  self- discipline, started working on the puzzle. In general, they looked relaxed. One of them tried a straightforward approach, hit a roadblock, and then started again. And again. And again. Some worked for over half an hour \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   136 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   136 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nStarbucks and the Habit of Success  ● 137\nbefore the researcher told them to stop. On average, the cookie eat-\ners spent almost nineteen minutes apiece trying to solve the puzzle before they rang the bell.\nThe radish eaters, with their depleted willpower, acted completely \ndifferent. They muttered as they worked. They got frustrated. One complained that the whole experiment was a waste of time. Some of them put their heads on the table and closed their eyes. One snapped at the researcher when she came back in. On average, the radish eaters worked for only about eight minutes, 60 percent less time than the cookie eaters, before quitting. When the researcher asked afterward how they felt, one of the radish eaters said he was “sick of this dumb experiment.”\n“By making people use a little bit of their willpower to ignore \ncookies, we had put them into a state where they were willing to quit",

    "text": " wait about ﬁ  fteen minutes for the sensory memory of \nthe food you ate to fade,” the researcher told each participant. To pass the time, she asked them to complete a puzzle. It looked fairly simple: trace a geometric pattern without lifting your pencil from the page or going over the same line twice. If you want to quit, the researcher said, ring the bell. She implied the puzzle wouldn ’t take long.\nIn truth, the puzzle was impossible to solve.This puzzle wasn ’t a way to pass time; it was the most important \npart of the experiment. It took enormous willpower to keep working on the puzzle, particularly when each attempt failed. The scientists wondered, would the students who had already expended their will-power by ignoring the cookies give up on the puzzle faster? In other words, was willpower a ﬁ  nite resource?\nFrom behind their  two- way mirror, the researchers watched. The \ncookie eaters, with their unused reservoirs of  self- discipline, started working on the puzzle. In general, they looked relaxed. One of them tried a straightforward approach, hit a roadblock, and then started again. And again. And again. Some worked for over half an hour \nDuhi_978",

It’s a muscle, like the muscles in your arms or legs, and it gets tired as it works harder, so there’s less power left over for other things.”\nResearchers have built on this ﬁ  nding to explain all sorts of phe-\nnomena. Some have suggested it helps clarify why otherwise suc-cessful people succumb to extramarital affairs (which are most likely to start late at night after a long day of using willpower at work) or why good physicians make dumb mistakes (which most often occur after a doctor has ﬁ  nished a long, complicated task that \nrequires intense focus). “If you want to do something that requires  willpower— like going for a run after  work— you have to conserve your willpower muscle during the day,” Muraven told me.\n “If you \nuse it up too early on tedious tasks like writing emails or ﬁ  lling out \ncomplicated and boring expense forms, all the strength will be gone by the time you get home.”\n● ● ●\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   137 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   137 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n138 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nBut how far does this analogy extend? Will exercising willpower \nmuscles make them stronger the same way using dumbbells strengthen biceps?\nIn 2006, two Australian  researchers— Megan Oaten and Ken \n Cheng— tried to answer that question by creating a willpower work-out. They enrolled two dozen people between the ages of eighteen and ﬁ  fty in a physical exercise program and, over two months, put \nthem through an increasing number of weight lifting, resistance training, and aerobic routines. Week after week, people forced them-selves to exercise more frequently, using more and more willpower each time they hit the gym.\nAfter two months, the researchers scrutinized the rest of the par-\nticipants’ lives to see if increased willpower at the gym resulted in greater willpower at home. Before the experiment began, most of the subjects were  self- professed couch potatoes. Now, of course, they were in better physical shape. But they were also healthier in other parts of their lives, as well. The more time they spent at the gym, the fewer cigarettes they smoked and the less alcohol, caffeine, and junk food they consumed. They were spending more hours on homework and fewer watching TV. They were less depressed.\nMaybe, Oaten and Cheng wondered, those results had nothing to \ndo with willpower. What if exercise just makes people happier and less hungry for fast food?\nSo they designed another experiment. This time, they signed up \n twenty- nine people for a  four- month money management program. They set savings goals and asked participants to deny themselves luxuries, such as meals at restaurants or movies. Participants were asked to keep detailed logs of everything they bought, which was annoying at ﬁ  rst, but eventually people worked up the  self- discipline \nto jot down every purchase.\nPeople’s ﬁ  nances improved as they progressed through the pro-\ngram. More surprising, they also smoked fewer cigarettes and drank less alcohol and  caffeine— on average, two fewer cups of coffee, two \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   138 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   138 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nStarbucks and the Habit of Success  ● 139\nfewer beers, and, among smokers, ﬁ  fteen fewer cigarettes each day. \nThey ate less junk food and were more productive at work and school. It was like the exercise study: As people strengthened their willpower muscles in one part of their  lives— in the gym, or a money management  program— that strength spilled over into what they ate or how hard they worked. Once willpower became stronger, it touched everything.\nOaten and Cheng did one more experiment. They enrolled \n forty- ﬁ  ve students in an academic improvement program that fo-\ncused on creating study habits. Predictably, participants’ learning skills improved. And the students also smoked less, drank less, watched less television, exercised more, and ate healthier, even though all those things were never mentioned in the academic pro-gram. Again, as their willpower muscles strengthened, good habits seemed to spill over into other parts of their lives.\n“When you learn to",

It’s a muscle, like the muscles in your arms or legs, and it gets tired as it works harder, so there’s less power left over for other things.”\nResearchers have built on this ﬁ  nding to explain all sorts of phe-\nnomena. Some have suggested it helps clarify why otherwise suc-cessful people succumb to extramarital affairs (which are most likely to start late at night after a long day of using willpower at work) or why good physicians make dumb mistakes (which most often occur after a doctor has ﬁ  nished a long, complicated task that \nrequires intense focus). “If you want to do something that requires  willpower— like going for a run after  work— you have to conserve your willpower muscle during the day,” Muraven told me.\n “If you \nuse it up too early on tedious tasks like writing emails or ﬁ  lling out \ncomplicated and boring expense forms, all the strength will be gone by the time you get home.”\n● ● ●\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   137 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   137 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n138 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nBut how far does this analogy extend? Will exercising willpower \nmuscles make them stronger the same way using dumbbells strengthen biceps?\nIn 2006, two Australian  researchers— Megan Oaten and Ken \n Cheng— tried to answer that question by creating a willpower work-out. They enrolled two dozen people between the ages of eighteen and ﬁ  fty in a physical exercise program and, over two months, put \nthem through an increasing number of weight lifting, resistance training, and aerobic routines. Week after week, people forced them-selves to exercise more frequently, using more and more willpower each time they hit the gym.\nAfter two months, the researchers scrutinized the rest of the par-\nticipants’ lives to see if increased willpower at the gym resulted in greater willpower at home. Before the experiment began, most of the subjects were  self-",

    "text": " much faster,” Muraven told me. “There’s been more than two hun-dred studies on this idea since then, and they’ve all found the same thing. Willpower isn ’t just a skill. It’s a muscle, like the muscles in your arms or legs, and it gets tired as it works harder, so there’s less power left over for other things.”\nResearchers have built on this ﬁ  nding to explain all sorts of phe-\nnomena. Some have suggested it helps clarify why otherwise suc-cessful people succumb to extramarital affairs (which are most likely to start late at night after a long day of using willpower at work) or why good physicians make dumb mistakes (which most often occur after a doctor has ﬁ  nished a long, complicated task that \nrequires intense focus). “If you want to do something that requires  willpower— like going for a run after  work— you have to conserve your willpower muscle during the day,” Muraven told me.\n “If you \nuse it up too early on tedious tasks like writing emails or ﬁ  lling out \ncomplicated and boring expense forms, all the strength will be gone by the time you get home.”\n● ●",

Before the experiment began, most of the subjects were  self- professed couch potatoes. Now, of course, they were in better physical shape. But they were also healthier in other parts of their lives, as well. The more time they spent at the gym, the fewer cigarettes they smoked and the less alcohol, caffeine, and junk food they consumed. They were spending more hours on homework and fewer watching TV. They were less depressed.\nMaybe, Oaten and Cheng wondered, those results had nothing to \ndo with willpower. What if exercise just makes people happier and less hungry for fast food?\nSo they designed another experiment. This time, they signed up \n twenty- nine people for a  four- month money management program. They set savings goals and asked participants to deny themselves luxuries, such as meals at restaurants or movies. Participants were asked to keep detailed logs of everything they bought, which was annoying at ﬁ  rst, but eventually people worked up the  self- discipline \nto jot down every purchase.\nPeople’s ﬁ  nances improved as they progressed through the pro-\ngram. More surprising, they also smoked fewer cigarettes and drank less alcohol and  caffeine— on average, two fewer cups of coffee, two \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   138 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   138 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nStarbucks and the Habit of Success  ● 139\nfewer beers, and, among smokers, ﬁ  fteen fewer cigarettes each day. \nThey ate less junk food and were more productive at work and school. It was like the exercise study: As people strengthened their willpower muscles in one part of their  lives— in the gym, or a money management  program— that strength spilled over into what they ate or how hard they worked. Once willpower became stronger, it touched everything.\nOaten and Cheng did one more experiment. They enrolled \n forty- ﬁ  ve students in an academic improvement program that fo-\ncused on creating study habits. Predictably, participants’ learning skills improved. And the students also smoked less, drank less, watched less",

    "text": " gym.\nAfter two months, the researchers scrutinized the rest of the par-\nticipants’ lives to see if increased willpower at the gym resulted in greater willpower at home. Before the experiment began, most of the subjects were  self- professed couch potatoes. Now, of course, they were in better physical shape. But they were also healthier in other parts of their lives, as well. The more time they spent at the gym, the fewer cigarettes they smoked and the less alcohol, caffeine, and junk food they consumed. They were spending more hours on homework and fewer watching TV. They were less depressed.\nMaybe, Oaten and Cheng wondered, those results had nothing to \ndo with willpower. What if exercise just makes people happier and less hungry for fast food?\nSo they designed another experiment. This time, they signed up \n twenty- nine people for a  four- month money management program. They set savings goals and asked participants to deny themselves luxuries, such as meals at restaurants or movies. Participants were asked to keep detailed logs of everything they bought, which was annoying at ﬁ  rst, but eventually people worked up the  self- discipline \nto jot down every purchase.\nPeople’s ﬁ  nances improved as they progressed",

Again, as their willpower muscles strengthened, good habits seemed to spill over into other parts of their lives.\n“When you learn to force yourself to go to the gym or start your \nhomework or eat a salad instead of a hamburger, part of what’s hap-pening is that you’re changing how you think,” said Todd Heather-ton, a researcher at Dartmouth who has worked on willpower studies. “People get better at regulating their impulses. They learn how to distract themselves from temptations. And once you’ve got-ten into that willpower groove, your brain is practiced at helping you focus on a goal.”\nThere are now hundreds of researchers, at nearly every major \nuniversity, studying willpower. Public and charter schools in Phila-delphia, Seattle, New York, and elsewhere have started incorporat-ing  willpower- strengthening lessons into curriculums. At KIPP, or the “Knowledge Is Power Program ”—a collection of charter schools serving  low- income students across the  nation— teaching  self- control is part of the schools’ philosophy. (A KIPP school in Philadelphia gave students shirts proclaiming “Don ’t Eat the Marshmallow.”) Many of these schools have dramatically raised students’ test scores.\n“That’s why signing kids up for piano lessons or sports is so im-\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   139 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   139 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n140 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nportant. It has nothing to do with creating a good musician or a \n ﬁ ve- year- old soccer star,” said Heatherton. “When you learn to force \nyourself to practice for an hour or run ﬁ  fteen laps, you start building \n self- regulatory strength. A  ﬁ  ve- year- old who can follow the ball for \nten minutes becomes a sixth grader who can start his homework on time.”\nAs research on willpower has become a hot topic in scientiﬁ  c \njournals and newspaper articles, it has started to trickle into corpo-rate America. Firms such as  Starbucks— and the Gap,  Wal- Mart, res-taurants, or any other business that relies on  entry- level  workers— all face a common problem: No matter how much their employees want  \nto do a great job, many will fail because they lack  self- discipline. They show up late. They snap at rude customers. They get distracted or drawn into workplace dramas. They quit for no reason.\n“For a lot of employees, Starbucks is their ﬁ  rst professional expe-\nrience,” said Christine Deputy, who helped oversee the company’s training programs for more than a decade. “If your parents or teach-ers have been telling you what to do your entire life, and suddenly customers are yelling and your boss is too busy to give you guid-ance, it can be really overwhelming.

Again, as their willpower muscles strengthened, good habits seemed to spill over into other parts of their lives.\n“When you learn to force yourself to go to the gym or start your \nhomework or eat a salad instead of a hamburger, part of what’s hap-pening is that you’re changing how you think,” said Todd Heather-ton, a researcher at Dartmouth who has worked on willpower studies. “People get better at regulating their impulses. They learn how to distract themselves from temptations. And once you’ve got-ten into that willpower groove, your brain is practiced at helping you focus on a goal.”\nThere are now hundreds of researchers, at nearly every major \nuniversity, studying willpower. Public and charter schools in Phila-delphia, Seattle, New York, and elsewhere have started incorporat-ing  willpower- strengthening lessons into curriculums. At KIPP, or the “Knowledge Is Power Program ”—a collection of charter schools serving  low- income students across the  nation— teaching  self- control is part of the schools’ philosophy.

It has nothing to do with creating a good musician or a \n ﬁ ve- year- old soccer star,” said Heatherton. “When you learn to force \nyourself to practice for an hour or run ﬁ  fteen laps, you start building \n self- regulatory strength. A  ﬁ  ve- year- old who can follow the ball for \nten minutes becomes a sixth grader who can start his homework on time.”\nAs research on willpower has become a hot topic in scientiﬁ  c \njournals and newspaper articles, it has started to trickle into corpo-rate America.

    "text": "As research on willpower has become a hot topic in scientiﬁ  c \njournals and newspaper articles, it has started to trickle into corpo-rate America. Firms such as  Starbucks— and the Gap,  Wal- Mart, res-taurants, or any other business that relies on  entry- level  workers— all face a common problem: No matter how much their employees want  \nto do a great job, many will fail because they lack  self- discipline. They show up late. They snap at rude customers. They get distracted or drawn into workplace dramas. They quit for no reason.\n“For a lot of employees, Starbucks is their ﬁ  rst professional expe-\nrience,” said Christine Deputy, who helped oversee the company’s training programs for more than a decade. “If your parents or teach-ers have been telling you what to do your entire life, and suddenly customers are yelling and your boss is too busy to give you guid-ance, it can be really overwhelming. A lot of people can ’t make the transition. So we try to ﬁ  gure out how to give our employees the \n self- discipline they didn ’t learn in high school.”\nBut when companies like Starbucks tried to apply the willpower \nlessons gleaned from the  radish- and- cookie and exercise studies to the workplace, they encountered difﬁ  culties. They sponsored \n weight- loss classes and offered employees free gym memberships, hoping the beneﬁ  ts would spill over to how they served coffee. At-\ntendance was spotty. It was hard to sit through a class or hit the gym after a full day at work, employees complained. “If someone has trouble with  self- discipline at work, they’re probably also going to have trouble attending a program designed to strengthen their  self- discipline after work,” Muraven said.\nBut Starbucks was determined to solve this problem.

People expect an expensive latte delivered with a bit of sparkle. “We’re not in the coffee business serving people,” Howard Behar, the former president of Starbucks, told me. “We’re in the peo-ple business serving coffee. Our entire business model is based on fantastic customer service. Without that, we’re toast.”\nThe solution, Starbucks discovered, was turning  self- discipline \ninto an organizational habit.\nIII.\nIn 1992, a British psychologist walked into two of Scotland’s busiest orthopedic hospitals and recruited  ﬁ  ve- dozen patients for an experi-\nment she hoped would explain how to boost the willpower of people exceptionally resistant to change.\nThe patients, on average, were  sixty- eight years old. Most of them \nearned less than $10,000 a year and didn ’t have more than a high school degree. All of them had recently undergone hip or knee re-placement surgeries, but because they were relatively poor and un-educated, many had waited years for their operations. They were retirees, elderly mechanics, and store clerks. They were in life’s ﬁ  nal \nchapters, and most had no desire to pick up a new book.\nRecovering from a hip or knee surgery is incredibly arduous. \nThe operation involves severing joint muscles and sawing through bones. While recovering, the smallest  movements— shifting in bed or ﬂ exing a  joint— can be excruciating. However, it is essential that \npatients begin exercising almost as soon as they wake from surgery. They must begin moving their legs and hips before the muscles and skin have healed, or scar tissue will clog the joint, destroying its ﬂ  ex-\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   141 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   141 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n142 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nibility. In addition, if patients don ’t start exercising, they risk devel-\noping blood clots. But the agony is so extreme that it’s not unusual for people to skip out on rehab sessions. Patients, particularly el-derly ones, often refuse to comply with doctor’s orders.\nThe Scottish study’s participants were the types of people most \nlikely to fail at rehabilitation. The scientist conducting the experi-ment wanted to see if it was possible to help them harness their willpower. She gave each patient a booklet after their surgeries that detailed their rehab schedule, and in the back were thirteen addi-tional  pages— one for each  week— with blank spaces and instruc-tions: “My goals for this week are __________ ? Write down exactly what you are going to do. For example, if you are going to go for a walk this week, write down where and when you are going to walk.” She asked patients to ﬁ  ll in each of those pages with speciﬁ  c plans. \nThen she compared the recoveries of those who wrote out goals with those of another set of patients who had received the same booklets, but didn ’t write anything.\nIt seems absurd to think that giving people a few pieces of blank \npaper might make a difference in how quickly they recover from surgery. But when the researcher visited the patients three months later, she found a striking difference between the two groups. The patients who had written plans in their booklets had started walking almost twice as fast as the ones who had not. They had started get-ting in and out of their chairs, unassisted, almost three times as fast. They were putting on their shoes, doing the laundry, and making themselves meals quicker than the patients who hadn ’t scribbled out goals ahead of time.\nThe psychologist wanted to understand why. She examined the \nbooklets, and discovered that most of the blank pages had been ﬁ  lled \nin with speciﬁ  c, detailed plans about the most mundane aspects of \nrecovery. One patient, for example, had written, “I will walk to the bus stop tomorrow to meet my wife from work,” and then noted what time he would leave, the route he would walk, what he would \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   142 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   142 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nStarbucks and the Habit of Success  ● 143\nwear, which coat he would bring if it was",

People expect an expensive latte delivered with a bit of sparkle. “We’re not in the coffee business serving people,” Howard Behar, the former president of Starbucks, told me. “We’re in the peo-ple business serving coffee. Our entire business model is based on fantastic customer service. Without that, we’re toast.”\nThe solution, Starbucks discovered, was turning  self- discipline \ninto an organizational habit.\nIII.\nIn 1992, a British psychologist walked into two of Scotland’s busiest orthopedic hospitals and recruited  ﬁ  ve- dozen patients for an experi-\nment she hoped would explain how to boost the willpower of people exceptionally resistant to change.\nThe patients, on average, were  sixty- eight years old. Most of them \nearned less than $10,000 a year and didn ’t have more than a high school degree. All of them had recently undergone hip or knee re-placement surgeries, but because they were relatively poor and un-educated, many had waited years for their operations. They were retirees, elderly mechanics, and store clerks. They were in life’s ﬁ  nal \nchapters, and most had no desire to pick up a new book.\nRecovering from a hip or knee surgery is incredibly arduous. \nThe operation involves severing joint muscles and sawing through bones. While recovering, the smallest  movements— shifting in bed or ﬂ exing a  joint— can be excruciating. However, it is essential that \npatients begin exercising almost as soon as they wake from surgery. They must begin moving their legs and hips before the muscles and skin have healed, or scar tissue will clog the joint, destroying its ﬂ  ex-\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   141 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   141 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n142 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nibility.

    "text": " THE POWER OF HABIT\nibility. In addition, if patients don ’t start exercising, they risk devel-\noping blood clots. But the agony is so extreme that it’s not unusual for people to skip out on rehab sessions. Patients, particularly el-derly ones, often refuse to comply with doctor’s orders.\nThe Scottish study’s participants were the types of people most \nlikely to fail at rehabilitation. The scientist conducting the experi-ment wanted to see if it was possible to help them harness their willpower. She gave each patient a booklet after their surgeries that detailed their rehab schedule, and in the back were thirteen addi-tional  pages— one for each  week— with blank spaces and instruc-tions: “My goals for this week are __________ ? Write down exactly what you are going to do. For example, if you are going to go for a walk this week, write down where and when you are going to walk.” She asked patients to ﬁ  ll in each of those pages with speciﬁ  c plans. \nThen she compared the recoveries of those who wrote out goals with those of another set of patients who had received the same booklets, but didn ’t write anything.\nIt seems absurd to think that giving people a few pieces of blank \npaper might make a difference in how quickly they recover from surgery. But when the researcher visited the patients three months later, she found a striking difference between the two groups. The patients who had written plans in their booklets had started walking almost twice as fast as the ones who had not. They had started get-ting in and out of their chairs, unassisted, almost three times as fast. They were putting on their shoes, doing the laundry, and making themselves meals quicker than the patients who hadn ’t scribbled out goals ahead of time.\nThe psychologist wanted to understand why. She examined the \nbooklets, and discovered that most of the blank pages had been ﬁ  lled \nin with speciﬁ  c, detailed plans about the most mundane aspects of \nrecovery. One patient, for example, had written, “I will walk to the bus stop tomorrow to meet my wife from work,” and then noted what time he would leave, the route he would walk, what he would \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   142 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd",

    "text": " THE POWER OF HABIT\nibility. In addition, if patients don ’t start exercising, they risk devel-\noping blood clots. But the agony is so extreme that it’s not unusual for people to skip out on rehab sessions. Patients, particularly el-derly ones, often refuse to comply with doctor’s orders.\nThe Scottish study’s participants were the types of people most \nlikely to fail at rehabilitation. The scientist conducting the experi-ment wanted to see if it was possible to help them harness their willpower. She gave each patient a booklet after their surgeries that detailed their rehab schedule, and in the back were thirteen addi-tional  pages— one for each  week— with blank spaces and instruc-tions: “My goals for this week are __________ ? Write down exactly what you are going to do. For example, if you are going to go for a walk this week, write down where and when you are going to walk.” She asked patients to ﬁ  ll in each of those pages with speciﬁ  c plans. \nThen she compared the recoveries of those who wrote out goals with those of another set of patients who had received the same booklets, but didn ’t write anything.\nIt seems absurd",

Another patient, in a simi-lar study, wrote a series of very speciﬁ  c schedules regarding the exer-\ncises he would do each time he went to the bathroom. A third wrote a  minute- by- minute itinerary for walking around the block.\nAs the psychologist scrutinized the booklets, she saw that many \nof the plans had something in common: They focused on how pa-tients would handle a speciﬁ  c moment of anticipated pain. The man \nwho exercised on the way to the bathroom, for instance, knew that each time he stood up from the couch, the ache was excruciating. So he wrote out a plan for dealing with it: Automatically take the ﬁ  rst \nstep, right away, so he wouldn ’t be tempted to sit down again. The patient who met his wife at the bus stop dreaded the afternoons, because that stroll was the longest and most painful each day. So he detailed every obstacle he might confront, and came up with a solu-tion ahead of time.\nPut another way, the patients’ plans were built around inﬂ  ection \npoints when they knew their  pain— and thus the temptation to  quit— would be strongest. The patients were telling themselves how they were going to make it over the hump.\nEach of them, intuitively, employed the same rules that Claude \nHopkins had used to sell Pepsodent. They identiﬁ  ed simple cues \nRoutine\nReward CueCRAVING TO \nWALK AGAIN\nPATIENTS DESIGNED WILLPOWER \nHABITS TO HELP THEM OVERCOME \nPAINFUL INFLECTION POINTS\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   143 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   143 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n144 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nand obvious rewards. The man who met his wife at the bus stop, for \ninstance, identiﬁ  ed an easy  cue— It’s 3:30, she’s on her way home! —\nand he clearly deﬁ  ned his  reward— Honey, I’m here!  When the temp-\ntation to give up halfway through the walk appeared, the patient could ignore it because he had crafted  self- discipline into a habit.\nThere’s no reason why the other  patients— the ones who didn ’t \nwrite out recovery  plans— couldn ’t have behaved the same way. All the patients had been exposed to the same admonitions and warn-ings at the hospital. They all knew exercise was essential for their recovery. They all spent weeks in rehab.\nBut the patients who didn ’t write out any plans were at a signiﬁ  -\ncant disadvantage, because they never thought ahead about how to deal with painful inﬂ  ection points. They never deliberately designed \nwillpower habits. Even if they intended to walk around the block, their resolve abandoned them when they confronted the agony of the ﬁ rst few steps.\n● ● ●\nWhen Starbucks’s attempts at boosting workers’ willpower through \ngym memberships and diet workshops faltered, executives decided they needed to take a new approach. They started by looking more closely at what was actually happening inside their stores. They saw that, like the Scottish patients, their workers were failing when they ran up against inﬂ  ection points. What they needed were institu-\ntional habits that made it easier to muster their  self- discipline.\nExecutives determined that, in some ways, they had been think-\ning about willpower all wrong. Employees with willpower lapses, it turned out, had no difﬁ  culty doing their jobs most of the time. On \nthe average day, a  willpower- challenged worker was no different from anyone else. But sometimes, particularly when faced with un-expected stresses or uncertainties, those employees would snap and their  self- control would evaporate.

Another patient, in a simi-lar study, wrote a series of very speciﬁ  c schedules regarding the exer-\ncises he would do each time he went to the bathroom. A third wrote a  minute- by- minute itinerary for walking around the block.\nAs the psychologist scrutinized the booklets, she saw that many \nof the plans had something in common: They focused on how pa-tients would handle a speciﬁ  c moment of anticipated pain. The man \nwho exercised on the way to the bathroom, for instance, knew that each time he stood up from the couch, the ache was excruciating. So he wrote out a plan for dealing with it: Automatically take the ﬁ  rst \nstep, right away, so he wouldn ’t be tempted to sit down again. The patient who met his wife at the bus stop dreaded the afternoons, because that stroll was the longest and most painful each day. So he detailed every obstacle he might confront, and came up with a solu-tion ahead of time.\nPut another way, the patients’ plans were built around inﬂ  ection \npoints when they knew their  pain— and thus the temptation to  quit— would be strongest. The patients were telling themselves how they were going to make it over the hump.\nEach of them, intuitively, employed the same rules that Claude \nHopkins had used to sell Pepsodent.

    "text": " for dealing with it: Automatically take the ﬁ  rst \nstep, right away, so he wouldn ’t be tempted to sit down again. The patient who met his wife at the bus stop dreaded the afternoons, because that stroll was the longest and most painful each day. So he detailed every obstacle he might confront, and came up with a solu-tion ahead of time.\nPut another way, the patients’ plans were built around inﬂ  ection \npoints when they knew their  pain— and thus the temptation to  quit— would be strongest. The patients were telling themselves how they were going to make it over the hump.\nEach of them, intuitively, employed the same rules that Claude \nHopkins had used to sell Pepsodent.

The man who met his wife at the bus stop, for \ninstance, identiﬁ  ed an easy  cue— It’s 3:30, she’s on her way home! —\nand he clearly deﬁ  ned his  reward— Honey, I’m here!  When the temp-\ntation to give up halfway through the walk appeared, the patient could ignore it because he had crafted  self- discipline into a habit.\nThere’s no reason why the other  patients— the ones who didn ’t \nwrite out recovery  plans— couldn ’t have behaved the same way. All the patients had been exposed to the same admonitions and warn-ings at the hospital. They all knew exercise was essential for their recovery. They all spent weeks in rehab.\nBut the patients who didn ’t write out any plans were at a signiﬁ  -\ncant disadvantage, because they never thought ahead about how to deal with painful inﬂ  ection points. They never deliberately designed \nwillpower habits. Even if they intended to walk around the block, their resolve abandoned them when they confronted the agony of the ﬁ rst few steps.\n● ● ●\nWhen Starbucks’s attempts at boosting workers’ willpower through \ngym memberships and diet workshops faltered, executives decided they needed to take a new approach. They started by looking more closely at what was actually happening inside their stores. They saw that, like the Scottish patients, their workers were failing when they ran up against inﬂ  ection points. What they needed were institu-\ntional habits that made it easier to muster their  self- discipline.\nExecutives determined that, in some ways, they had been think-\ning about willpower all wrong. Employees with willpower lapses, it turned out, had no difﬁ  culty doing their jobs most of the time. On \nthe average day, a  willpower- challenged worker was no different from anyone else. But sometimes, particularly when faced with un-expected stresses or uncertainties, those employees would snap and their  self- control would evaporate.

An impatient crowd might overwhelm a barista, and suddenly he was on the edge of tears.\nWhat employees really needed were clear instructions about how \nto deal with inﬂ  ection  points— something similar to the Scottish \npatients’ booklets: a routine for employees to follow when their will-power muscles went limp. So the company developed new training materials that spelled out routines for employees to use when they hit rough patches. The manuals taught workers how to respond to speciﬁ  c cues, such as a screaming customer or a long line at a cash \nregister. Managers drilled employees,  role- playing with them until the responses became automatic. The company identiﬁ  ed speciﬁ  c \n rewards— a grateful customer, praise from a  manager— that em-ployees could look to as evidence of a job well done.\nStarbucks taught their employees how to handle moments of ad-\nversity by giving them willpower habit loops.\nWhen Travis started at Starbucks, for instance, his manager in-\ntroduced him to the habits right away. “One of the hardest things about this job is dealing with an angry customer,” Travis’s manager told him. “When someone comes up and starts yelling at you be-cause they got the wrong drink, what’s your ﬁ  rst reaction?”\n“I don ’t know,” Travis said. “I guess I feel kind of scared. Or \nangry.”\n“That’s natural,” his manager said. “But our job is to provide the \nbest customer service, even when the pressure’s on.” The manager ﬂ ipped open the Starbucks manual, and showed Travis a page that \nwas largely blank. At the top, it read, “When a customer is unhappy, my plan is to . . .”\n“This workbook is for you to imagine unpleasant situations, and \nwrite out a plan for responding,” the manager said. “One of the sys-tems we use is called the LATTE method. We Listen to the customer, \nAcknowledge their complaint, Take action by solving the problem, \nThank them, and then Explain why the problem occurred.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   145 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   145 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n146 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\n“Why don ’t you take a few minutes, and write out a plan for deal-\ning with an angry customer. Use the LATTE method. Then we can \n role- play a little bit.”\nStarbucks has dozens of routines that employees are taught to \nuse during stressful inﬂ  ection points. There’s the What What Why \nsystem of giving criticism and the Connect, Discover, and Respond \nsystem for taking orders when things become hectic. There are learned habits to help baristas tell the difference between patrons who just want their coffee (“ A hurried customer speaks with a sense of urgency and may seem impatient or look at their watch ”) and those who need a bit more coddling (“ A regular customer knows other baristas by name and normally orders the same beverage each day”). Throughout the training manuals are dozens of blank pages where employees can write out plans that anticipate how they will surmount inﬂ  ection points. Then they practice those plans, again \nand again, until they become automatic.\nThis is how willpower becomes a habit: by choosing a certain \nbehavior ahead of time, and then following that routine when an inﬂ ection point arrives. When the Scottish patients ﬁ  lled out their \nbooklets, or Travis studied the LATTE  method, they decided ahead \nof time how to react to a  cue— a painful muscle or an angry cus-tomer. When the cue arrived, the routine occurred.\nStarbucks isn ’t the only company to use such training methods.

An impatient crowd might overwhelm a barista, and suddenly he was on the edge of tears.\nWhat employees really needed were clear instructions about how \nto deal with inﬂ  ection  points— something similar to the Scottish \npatients’ booklets: a routine for employees to follow when their will-power muscles went limp. So the company developed new training materials that spelled out routines for employees to use when they hit rough patches. The manuals taught workers how to respond to speciﬁ  c cues, such as a screaming customer or a long line at a cash \nregister. Managers drilled employees,  role- playing with them until the responses became automatic. The company identiﬁ  ed speciﬁ  c \n rewards— a grateful customer, praise from a  manager— that em-ployees could look to as evidence of a job well done.\nStarbucks taught their employees how to handle moments of ad-\nversity by giving them willpower habit loops.\nWhen Travis started at Starbucks, for instance, his manager in-\ntroduced him to the habits right away. “One of the hardest things about this job is dealing with an angry customer,” Travis’s manager told him. “When someone comes up and starts yelling at you be-cause they got the wrong drink, what’s your ﬁ  rst reaction?”\n“I don ’t know,” Travis said. “I guess I feel kind of scared. Or \nangry.”\n“That’s natural,” his manager said. “But our job is to provide the \nbest customer service, even when the pressure’s on.” The manager ﬂ ipped open the Starbucks manual, and showed Travis a page that \nwas largely blank. At the top, it read, “When a customer is unhappy, my plan is to . . .”\n“This workbook is for you to imagine unpleasant situations, and \nwrite out a plan for responding,” the manager said. “One of the sys-tems we use is called the LATTE method. We Listen to the customer, \nAcknowledge their complaint, Take action by solving the problem, \nThank them, and then Explain why the problem occurred.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd",

An impatient crowd might overwhelm a barista, and suddenly he was on the edge of tears.\nWhat employees really needed were clear instructions about how \nto deal with inﬂ  ection  points— something similar to the Scottish \npatients’ booklets: a routine for employees to follow when their will-power muscles went limp. So the company developed new training materials that spelled out routines for employees to use when they hit rough patches. The manuals taught workers how to respond to speciﬁ  c cues, such as a screaming customer or a long line at a cash \nregister. Managers drilled employees,  role- playing with them until the responses became automatic. The company identiﬁ  ed speciﬁ  c \n rewards— a grateful customer, praise from a  manager— that em-ployees could look to as evidence of a job well done.\nStarbucks taught their employees how to handle moments of ad-\nversity by giving them willpower habit loops.\n",

Use the LATTE method. Then we can \n role- play a little bit.”\nStarbucks has dozens of routines that employees are taught to \nuse during stressful inﬂ  ection points. There’s the What What Why \nsystem of giving criticism and the Connect, Discover, and Respond \nsystem for taking orders when things become hectic. There are learned habits to help baristas tell the difference between patrons who just want their coffee (“ A hurried customer speaks with a sense of urgency and may seem impatient or look at their watch ”) and those who need a bit more coddling (“ A regular customer knows other baristas by name and normally orders the same beverage each day”). Throughout the training manuals are dozens of blank pages where employees can write out plans that anticipate how they will surmount inﬂ  ection points. Then they practice those plans, again \nand again, until they become automatic.\nThis is how willpower becomes a habit: by choosing a certain \nbehavior ahead of time, and then following that routine when an inﬂ ection point arrives. When the Scottish patients ﬁ  lled out their \nbooklets, or Travis studied the LATTE  method, they decided ahead \nof time how to react to a  cue— a painful muscle or an angry cus-tomer. When the cue arrived, the routine occurred.\nStarbucks isn ’t the only company to use such training methods.

Throughout the training manuals are dozens of blank pages where employees can write out plans that anticipate how they will surmount inﬂ  ection points. Then they practice those plans, again \nand again, until they become automatic.\nThis is how willpower becomes a habit: by choosing a certain \nbehavior ahead of time, and then following that routine when an inﬂ ection point arrives. When the Scottish patients ﬁ  lled out their \nbooklets, or Travis studied the LATTE  method, they decided ahead \nof time how to react to a  cue— a painful muscle or an angry cus-tomer. When the cue arrived, the routine occurred.\nStarbucks isn ’t the only company to use such training methods.

For each of those moments, there are preprogrammed  routines— Get Curious, Say What No One Else Will, Apply the 5/5/5 \n Rule— that guide employees in how they should respond. At the \nContainer Store, employees receive more than 185 hours of training in their ﬁ  rst year alone. They are taught to recognize inﬂ  ection \npoints such as an angry  coworker or an overwhelmed customer, and habits, such as routines for calming shoppers or defusing a con-frontation. When a customer comes in who seems overwhelmed, for example, an employee immediately asks them to visualize the space in their home they are hoping to organize, and describe how they’ll feel when everything is in its place. “We’ve had customers come up to us and say, ‘This is better than a visit to my shrink,’” the company’s CEO told a reporter.\nIV.\nHoward Schultz, the man who built Starbucks into a colossus, isn ’t so different from Travis in some ways. He grew up in a public hous-ing project in Brooklyn, sharing a  two- bedroom apartment with his parents and two siblings. When he was seven years old, Schultz’s father broke his ankle and lost his job driving a diaper truck. That was all it took to throw the family into crisis. His father, after his ankle healed, began cycling through a series of lower-paying jobs. “My dad never found his way,” Schultz told me. “I saw his  self- esteem get battered. I felt like there was so much more he could have ac-complished.”\nSchultz’s school was a wild, overcrowded place with asphalt play-\ngrounds and kids playing football, basketball, softball, punch ball, \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   147 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   147 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n148 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nslap ball, and any other game they could devise. If your team lost, it \ncould take an hour to get another turn. So Schultz made sure his team always won, no matter the cost. He would come home with bloody scrapes on his elbows and knees, which his mother would gently rinse with a wet cloth. “You don ’t quit,” she told him.\nHis competitiveness earned him a college football scholarship \n(he broke his jaw and never played a game), a communications de-gree, and eventually a job as a Xerox salesman in New York City. He’d wake up every morning, go to a new midtown ofﬁ  ce building, \ntake the elevator to the top ﬂ  oor, and go  door- to- door, politely inquir-\ning if anyone was interested in toner or copy machines. Then he’d ride the elevator down one ﬂ  oor and start all over again.\nBy the early 1980s, Schultz was working for a plastics manufac-\nturer when he noticed that a  little- known retailer in Seattle was or-dering an inordinate number of coffee drip cones. Schultz ﬂ  ew out \nand fell in love with the company. Two years later, when he heard that Starbucks, then just six stores, was for sale, he asked everyone he knew for money and bought it.\nThat was 1987. Within three years, there were  eighty- four stores; \nwithin six years, more than a thousand. Today, there are seventeen thousand stores in more than ﬁ  fty countries.\nWhy did Schultz turn out so different from all the other kids on \nthat playground? Some of his old classmates today are cops and ﬁ  re-\nmen in Brooklyn. Others are in prison. Schultz, is worth more than $1 billion. He’s been heralded as one of the greatest CEOs of the twentieth century. Where did he ﬁ  nd the  determination— the \n willpower— to climb from a housing project to a private jet?\n“I don ’t really know,” he told me. “My mom always said, ‘You’re \ngoing to be the ﬁ  rst person to go to college, you’re going to be a pro-\nfessional, you’re going to make us all proud.’ She would ask these little questions, ‘How are you",

For each of those moments, there are preprogrammed  routines— Get Curious, Say What No One Else Will, Apply the 5/5/5 \n Rule— that guide employees in how they should respond. At the \nContainer Store, employees receive more than 185 hours of training in their ﬁ  rst year alone. They are taught to recognize inﬂ  ection \npoints such as an angry  coworker or an overwhelmed customer, and habits, such as routines for calming shoppers or defusing a con-frontation. When a customer comes in who seems overwhelmed, for example, an employee immediately asks them to visualize the space in their home they are hoping to organize, and describe how they’ll feel when everything is in its place. “We’ve had customers come up to us and say, ‘This is better than a visit to my shrink,’” the company’s CEO told a reporter.\nIV.\nHoward Schultz, the man who built Starbucks into a colossus, isn ’t so different from Travis in some ways. He grew up in a public hous-ing project in Brooklyn, sharing a  two- bedroom apartment with his parents and two siblings. When he was seven years old, Schultz’s father broke his ankle and lost his job driving a diaper truck. That was all it took to throw the family into crisis. His father, after his ankle healed, began cycling through a series of lower-paying jobs. “My dad never found his way,” Schultz told me. “I saw his  self- esteem get battered. I felt like there was so much more he could have ac-complished.”\nSchultz’s school was a wild, overcrowded place with asphalt play-\ngrounds and kids playing football, basketball, softball, punch ball, \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   147 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   147 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/",

If your team lost, it \ncould take an hour to get another turn. So Schultz made sure his team always won, no matter the cost. He would come home with bloody scrapes on his elbows and knees, which his mother would gently rinse with a wet cloth. “You don ’t quit,” she told him.\nHis competitiveness earned him a college football scholarship \n(he broke his jaw and never played a game), a communications de-gree, and eventually a job as a Xerox salesman in New York City. He’d wake up every morning, go to a new midtown ofﬁ  ce building, \ntake the elevator to the top ﬂ  oor, and go  door- to- door, politely inquir-\ning if anyone was interested in toner or copy machines. Then he’d ride the elevator down one ﬂ  oor and start all over again.\nBy the early 1980s, Schultz was working for a plastics manufac-\nturer when he noticed that a  little- known retailer in Seattle was or-dering an inordinate number of coffee drip cones. Schultz ﬂ  ew out \nand fell in love with the company. Two years later, when he heard that Starbucks, then just six stores, was for sale, he asked everyone he knew for money and bought it.\nThat was 1987. Within three years, there were  eighty- four stores; \nwithin six years, more than a thousand. Today, there are seventeen thousand stores in more than ﬁ  fty countries.\nWhy did Schultz turn out so different from all the other kids on \nthat playground? Some of his old classmates today are cops and ﬁ  re-\nmen in Brooklyn. Others are in prison. Schultz, is worth more than $1 billion. He’s been heralded as one of the greatest CEOs of the twentieth century. Where did he ﬁ  nd the  determination— the \n willpower— to climb from a housing project to a private jet?\n“I don ’t really know,” he told me. “My mom always said",

For years, he was personally involved in almost every aspect of how the company was run. In 2000, exhausted, he handed over  day- to- day operations to other executives, at which point, Starbucks began to stumble. Within a few years, customers were complaining about the quality of the drinks and customer service. Executives, focused on a frantic expansion, often ignored the complaints. Employees grew unhappy. Surveys indicated people were starting to equate Star-bucks with tepid coffee and empty smiles.\nSo Schultz stepped back into the chief executive position in 2008. \nAmong his priorities was restructuring the company’s training pro-gram to renew its focus on a variety of issues, including bolstering employees’—or “partners,” in Starbucks’ lingo— willpower and  self- conﬁ  dence. “We had to start earning customer and partner trust \nagain,” Schultz told me.\nAt about the same time, a new wave of studies was appearing \nthat looked at the science of willpower in a slightly different way. Researchers had noticed that some people, like Travis, were able to create willpower habits relatively easily. Others, however, struggled, no matter how much training and support they received. What was causing the difference?\nMark Muraven, who was by then a professor at the University of \nAlbany, set up a new experiment. He put undergraduates in a room that contained a plate of warm, fresh cookies and asked them to ig-nore the treats. Half the participants were treated kindly. “We ask that you please don ’t eat the cookies. Is that okay?” a researcher said. She then discussed the purpose of the experiment, explaining that it was to measure their ability to resist temptations. She thanked them for contributing their time. “If you have any suggestions or \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   149 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   149 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n150 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nthoughts about how we can improve this experiment, please let me \nknow. We want you to help us make this experience as good as pos-sible.”\nThe other half of the participants weren ’t coddled the same way. \nThey were simply given orders.\n“You must not eat the cookies,” the researcher told them. She \ndidn ’t explain the experiment’s goals, compliment them, or show any interest in their feedback. She told them to follow the instruc-tions. “We’ll start now,” she said.\nThe students from both groups had to ignore the warm cookies \nfor ﬁ ve minutes after the researcher left the room. None gave in to \ntemptation.\nThen the researcher returned. She asked each student to look at \na computer monitor. It was programmed to ﬂ  ash numbers on the \nscreen, one at a time, for ﬁ  ve hundred milliseconds apiece. The par-\nticipants were asked to hit the space bar every time they saw a “6” followed by a “4.” This has become a standard way to measure  willpower— paying attention to a boring sequence of ﬂ  ashing num-\nbers requires a focus akin to working on an impossible puzzle.\nStudents who had been treated kindly did well on the computer \ntest. Whenever a “6” ﬂ  ashed and a “4” followed, they pounced on \nthe space bar. They were able to maintain their focus for the entire twelve minutes. Despite ignoring the cookies, they had willpower to spare.\nStudents who had been treated rudely, on the other hand, did ter-\nribly. They kept forgetting to hit the space bar. They said they were tired and couldn ’t",

What was causing the difference?\nMark Muraven, who was by then a professor at the University of \nAlbany, set up a new experiment. He put undergraduates in a room that contained a plate of warm, fresh cookies and asked them to ig-nore the treats. Half the participants were treated kindly. “We ask that you please don ’t eat the cookies. Is that okay?” a researcher said. She then discussed the purpose of the experiment, explaining that it was to measure their ability to resist temptations. She thanked them for contributing their time. “If you have any suggestions or \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   149 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   149 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n150 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nthoughts about how we can improve this experiment, please let me \nknow. We want you to help us make this experience as good as pos-sible.”\nThe other half of the participants weren ’t coddled the same way. \nThey were simply given orders.\n“You must not eat the cookies,” the researcher told them. She \ndidn ’t explain the experiment’s goals, compliment them, or show any interest in their feedback. She told them to follow the instruc-tions. “We’ll start now,” she said.\nThe students from both groups had to ignore the warm cookies \nfor ﬁ ve minutes after the researcher left the room. None gave in to \ntemptation.\nThen the researcher returned. She asked each student to look at \na computer monitor. It was programmed to ﬂ  ash numbers on the \nscreen, one at a time, for ﬁ  ve hundred milliseconds apiece. The par-\nticipants were asked to hit the space bar every time they saw a “6” followed by a “4.” This has become a standard way to measure  willpower— paying attention to a boring sequence of ﬂ  ashing num-\nbers requires a focus akin to working on an impossible puzzle.\nStudents who had been treated kindly did well on the computer \ntest. Whenever a “6” ﬂ  ashed and a “4” followed, they pounced on \nthe space bar. They were able to maintain their focus for the entire twelve",

They said they were tired and couldn ’t focus. Their willpower muscle, researchers deter-mined, had been fatigued by the brusque instructions.\nWhen Muraven started exploring why students who had been \ntreated kindly had more willpower he found that the key difference was the sense of control they had over their experience. “We’ve found this again and again,” Muraven told me. “When people are \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   150 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   150 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nStarbucks and the Habit of Success  ● 151\nasked to do something that takes  self- control, if they think they are \ndoing it for personal  reasons— if they feel like it’s a choice or some-thing they enjoy because it helps someone  else— it’s much less tax-ing. If they feel like they have no autonomy, if they’re just following orders, their willpower muscles get tired much faster. In both cases, people ignored the cookies. But when the students were treated like cogs, rather than people, it took a lot more willpower.”\nFor companies and organizations, this insight has enormous im-\nplications. Simply giving employees a sense of  agency— a feeling that they are in control, that they have genuine  decision- making  authority— can radically increase how much energy and focus they bring to their jobs. One 2010 study at a manufacturing plant in Ohio, for instance, scrutinized assembly-line workers who were em-powered to make small decisions about their schedules and work environment. They designed their own uniforms and had authority over shifts. Nothing else changed. All the manufacturing processes and pay scales stayed the same. Within two months, productivity at the plant increased by 20 percent. Workers were taking shorter breaks. They were making fewer mistakes. Giving employees a sense of control improved how much  self- discipline they brought to their jobs.\nThe same lessons hold true at Starbucks. Today, the company is \nfocused on giving employees a greater sense of authority. They have asked workers to redesign how espresso machines and cash regis-ters are laid out, to decide for themselves how customers should be greeted and where merchandise should be displayed. It’s not un-usual for a store manager to spend hours discussing with his em-ployees where a blender should be located.\n“We’ve started asking partners to use their intellect and creativ-\nity, rather than telling them ‘take the coffee out of the box, put the cup here, follow this rule,’” said Kris Engskov, a vice president at Starbucks. “People want to be in control of their lives.”\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   151 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   151 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n152 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nTurnover has gone down. Customer satisfaction is up. Since \nSchultz’s return, Starbucks has boosted revenues by more than $1.2 billion per year.\nV.\nWhen Travis was sixteen, before he dropped out of school and started working for Starbucks, his mother told him a story. They were driving together, and Travis asked why he didn ’t have more siblings. His mother had always tried to be completely honest with her children, and so she told him that she had become pregnant two years before Travis was born but had gotten an abortion. They al-ready had two children at that point, she explained, and were ad-dicted to drugs. They didn ’t think they could support another baby. Then, a year later, she became pregnant with Travis. She thought about having another abortion, but it was too much to bear. It was easier to let nature take its course. Travis was born.\n“She told me that she had made a lot of mistakes, but that having \nme was one of the best things that ever happened to her,” Travis said. “When your parents are addicts, you grow up knowing you can ’t always trust them for everything you need. But I’ve been really lucky to ﬁ  nd bosses who gave me what was missing. If my mom had \nbeen as lucky as me, I think things would have turned out different for her.”\nA few years after that conversation, Travis’s father called to say \nthat an infection had entered his mother’s bloodstream through one of the places on her arm she used to shoot up. Travis immediately drove to the hospital in Lodi, but",

They said they were tired and couldn ’t focus. Their willpower muscle, researchers deter-mined, had been fatigued by the brusque instructions.\nWhen Muraven started exploring why students who had been \ntreated kindly had more willpower he found that the key difference was the sense of control they had over their experience. “We’ve found this again and again,” Muraven told me. “When people are \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   150 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   150 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nStarbucks and the Habit of Success  ● 151\nasked to do something that takes  self- control, if they think they are \ndoing it for personal  reasons— if they feel like it’s a choice or some-thing they enjoy because it helps someone  else— it’s much less tax-ing. If they feel like they have no autonomy, if they’re just following orders, their willpower muscles get tired much faster. In both cases, people ignored the cookies. But when the students were treated like cogs, rather than people, it took a lot more willpower.”\nFor companies and organizations, this insight has enormous im-\nplications. Simply giving employees a sense of  agency— a feeling that they are in control, that they have genuine  decision- making  authority— can radically increase how much energy and focus they bring to their jobs. One 2010 study at a manufacturing plant in Ohio, for instance, scrutinized assembly-line workers who were em-powered to make small decisions about their schedules and work environment. They designed their own uniforms and had authority over shifts. Nothing else changed. All the manufacturing processes and pay scales stayed the same. Within two months, productivity at the plant increased by 20 percent. Workers were taking shorter breaks. They were making fewer mistakes. Giving employees a sense of control improved how much  self- discipline they brought to their jobs.\nThe same lessons hold true at Starbucks. Today, the company is \nfocused on giving employees a greater sense of authority. They have asked workers to redesign how espresso machines and cash reg",

Today, the company is \nfocused on giving employees a greater sense of authority. They have asked workers to redesign how espresso machines and cash regis-ters are laid out, to decide for themselves how customers should be greeted and where merchandise should be displayed. It’s not un-usual for a store manager to spend hours discussing with his em-ployees where a blender should be located.\n“We’ve started asking partners to use their intellect and creativ-\nity, rather than telling them ‘take the coffee out of the box, put the cup here, follow this rule,’” said Kris Engskov, a vice president at Starbucks. “People want to be in control of their lives.”\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   151 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   151 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n152 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nTurnover has gone down. Customer satisfaction is up.

They were driving together, and Travis asked why he didn ’t have more siblings. His mother had always tried to be completely honest with her children, and so she told him that she had become pregnant two years before Travis was born but had gotten an abortion. They al-ready had two children at that point, she explained, and were ad-dicted to drugs. They didn ’t think they could support another baby. Then, a year later, she became pregnant with Travis. She thought about having another abortion, but it was too much to bear. It was easier to let nature take its course. Travis was born.\n“She told me that she had made a lot of mistakes, but that having \nme was one of the best things that ever happened to her,” Travis said. “When your parents are addicts, you grow up knowing you can ’t always trust them for everything you need. But I’ve been really lucky to ﬁ  nd bosses who gave me what was missing. If my mom had \nbeen as lucky as me, I think things would have turned out different for",

It’s not un-usual for a store manager to spend hours discussing with his em-ployees where a blender should be located.\n“We’ve started asking partners to use their intellect and creativ-\nity, rather than telling them ‘take the coffee out of the box, put the cup here, follow this rule,’” said Kris Engskov, a vice president at Starbucks. “People want to be in control of their lives.”\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   151 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   151 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n152 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nTurnover has gone down.

Since \nSchultz’s return, Starbucks has boosted revenues by more than $1.2 billion per year.\nV.\nWhen Travis was sixteen, before he dropped out of school and started working for Starbucks, his mother told him a story. They were driving together, and Travis asked why he didn ’t have more siblings. His mother had always tried to be completely honest with her children, and so she told him that she had become pregnant two years before Travis was born but had gotten an abortion. They al-ready had two children at that point, she explained, and were ad-dicted to drugs. They didn ’t think they could support another baby. Then, a year later, she became pregnant with Travis.

Travis immediately drove to the hospital in Lodi, but she was unconscious by the time he arrived. She died a half hour later, when they removed her life support.\nA week later, Travis’s father was in the hospital with pneumonia. \nHis lung had collapsed. Travis drove to Lodi again, but it was 8:02 \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   152 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   152 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nStarbucks and the Habit of Success  ● 153\nP.M. when he got to the emergency room. A nurse brusquely told \nhim he’d have to come back tomorrow; visiting hours were over.\nTravis has thought a lot about that moment since then. He hadn ’t \nstarted working at Starbucks yet. He hadn ’t learned how to control his emotions. He didn ’t have the habits that, since then, he’s spent years practicing. When he thinks about his life now, how far he is from a world where overdoses occur and stolen cars show up in driveways and a nurse seems like an insurmountable obstacle, he wonders how it’s possible to travel such a long distance in such a short time.\n“If he had died a year later, everything would have been differ-\nent,” Travis told me. By then, he would have known how to calmly plead with the nurse. He would have known to acknowledge her authority, and then ask politely for one small exception. He could have gotten inside the hospital. Instead, he gave up and walked away. “I said, ‘All I want to do is talk to him once,’ and she was like, ‘He’s not even awake, it’s after visiting hours, come back tomorrow.’ I didn ’t know what to say. I felt so small.”\nTravis’s father died that night.On the anniversary of his death, every year, Travis wakes up early, \ntakes an  extra- long shower, plans out his day in careful detail, and then drives to work. He always arrives on time.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   153 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   153 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM",

Travis immediately drove to the hospital in Lodi, but she was unconscious by the time he arrived. She died a half hour later, when they removed her life support.\nA week later, Travis’s father was in the hospital with pneumonia. \nHis lung had collapsed. Travis drove to Lodi again, but it was 8:02 \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   152 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   152 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nStarbucks and the Habit of Success  ● 153\nP.M. when he got to the emergency room. A nurse brusquely told \nhim he’d have to come back tomorrow; visiting hours were over.\nTravis has thought a lot about that moment since then. He hadn ’t \nstarted working at Starbucks yet. He hadn ’t learned how to control his emotions. He didn ’t have the habits that, since then, he’s spent years practicing. When he thinks about his life now, how far he is from a world where overdoses occur and stolen cars show up in driveways and a nurse seems like an insurmountable obstacle, he wonders how it’s possible to travel such a long distance in such a short time.\n“If he had died a year later, everything would have been differ-\nent,” Travis told me. By then, he would have known how to calmly plead with the nurse. He would have known to acknowledge her authority, and then ask politely for one small exception. He could have gotten inside the hospital. Instead, he gave up and walked away. “I said, ‘All I want to do is talk to him once,’ and she was like, ‘He’s not even awake, it’s after visiting hours, come back tomorrow.’ I didn ’t know what to say. I felt so small.”\nTravis’s father died that night.On the anniversary of his death, every year, Travis wakes up early, \ntakes an  extra- long shower, plans out his day in careful detail, and then drives to work. He always arrives on time.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all",

    "text": "’d have to come back tomorrow; visiting hours were over.\nTravis has thought a lot about that moment since then. He hadn ’t \nstarted working at Starbucks yet. He hadn ’t learned how to control his emotions. He didn ’t have the habits that, since then, he’s spent years practicing. When he thinks about his life now, how far he is from a world where overdoses occur and stolen cars show up in driveways and a nurse seems like an insurmountable obstacle, he wonders how it’s possible to travel such a long distance in such a short time.\n“If he had died a year later, everything would have been differ-\nent,” Travis told me. By then, he would have known how to calmly plead with the nurse. He would have known to acknowledge her authority, and then ask politely for one small exception. He could have gotten inside the hospital. Instead, he gave up and walked away. “I said, ‘All I want to do is talk to him once,’ and she was like, ‘He’s not even awake, it’s after visiting hours, come back tomorrow.’ I didn ’t know what to say. I felt so small.”\nTravis’s father died that night.On the anniversary of his death",
