Clear \nyour mind of everything except what you will read  and what I will invite you to do.  Don't worry \nabout your schedule, your business, your family, or your friends.  Just focus with me and really open \nyour mind.    In your mind's eye, see yourself going to the funeral parlor or chapel, parking the car, and getting \nout.  As you walk inside the building, you notice th e flowers, the soft organ music.  You see the faces \nof friends and family you pass along the way.  You feel the shared sorrow of lo sing, the joy of having \nknown, that radiates from the hearts of the people there.    As you walk down to the front of the room an d look inside the casket, you suddenly come face to \nface with yourself.  This is your funeral, three years  from today.  All these people have come to honor \nyou, to express feelings of love and appreciation for your life.    As you take a seat and wait for the services to begin, you look at the program in your hand.  There \nare to be four speakers.  The first one is from yo ur family, immediate and al so extended -- children, \nbrothers, sisters, nephews, nieces, aunts, uncles, cousins, and grandparents who have come from all \nover the country to attend.  The second speaker is one of your friends, someone who can give a sense \nof what you were as a person.  The third speaker is from your work or profession.  And the fourth is \nfrom your church or some community organizat ion where you've been involved in service. \n   Now think deeply.  What would you like each of  these speakers to say about you and your life? \nWhat kind of husband, wife, father, or mother woul d you like their words to reflect? What kind of son \nor daughter or cousin? What kind of fr iend? What kind of working associate? \n   What character would you like them to have seen  in you? What contributi ons, what achievements \nwould you want them to remember? Look carefully at the people around you.  What difference would \nyou like to have made in their lives?    Before you read further, take a few minutes to jo t down your impressions.  It will greatly increase \nyour personal understanding of Habit 2.  What it Means to \"Begin with the End in Mind\"     If you participated seriously in this visuali zation experience, you touched for a moment some of \nyour deep, fundamental values.  You established brie f contact with that inner guidance system at the \nheart of your Circle of Influence    Consider the words of Joseph Addison:    When I look upon the tombs of the great, ev ery emotion of envy dies in me; when I read the \nepitaphs of the beautiful, every inordinate desire goes  out; when I meet with th e grief of parents upon a \ntombstone, my heart melts with co mpassion; when I see the tomb of the parents themselves, I consider \nthe vanity of grieving for those whom we must quickly follow: when  I see kings lying by those who \ndeposed them, I consider rival wits placed side by side, or the holy men that divided the world with \ntheir contests and disputes, I reflect with sorrow an d astonishment on the little competitions, factions, \nand debates of mankind.  When I read the several date s of the tombs, of some that died yesterday, and \nsome six hundred years ago, I consider that great Day when we shall all of us be Contemporaries, and \nmake our appearance together.    Although Habit 2 applies to many different circ umstances and levels of lif e, the most fundamental \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \napplication of \"Begin with the End in Mind\" is to be gin today with the image, picture, or paradigm",

Clear \nyour mind of everything except what you will read  and what I will invite you to do.  Don't worry \nabout your schedule, your business, your family, or your friends.  Just focus with me and really open \nyour mind.    In your mind's eye, see yourself going to the funeral parlor or chapel, parking the car, and getting \nout.  As you walk inside the building, you notice th e flowers, the soft organ music.  You see the faces \nof friends and family you pass along the way.  You feel the shared sorrow of lo sing, the joy of having \nknown, that radiates from the hearts of the people there.    As you walk down to the front of the room an d look inside the casket, you suddenly come face to \nface with yourself.  This is your funeral, three years  from today.  All these people have come to honor \nyou, to express feelings of love and appreciation for your life.    As you take a seat and wait for the services to begin, you look at the program in your hand.  There \nare to be four speakers.  The first one is from yo ur family, immediate and al so extended -- children, \nbrothers, sisters, nephews, nieces, aunts, uncles, cousins, and grandparents who have come from all \nover the country to attend.  The second speaker is one of your friends, someone who can give a sense \nof what you were as a person.  The third speaker is from your work or profession.  And the fourth is \nfrom your church or some community organizat ion where you've been involved in service. \n   Now think deeply.  What would you like each of  these speakers to say about you and your life? \nWhat kind",

As you walk down to the front of the room an d look inside the casket, you suddenly come face to \nface with yourself.  This is your funeral, three years  from today.  All these people have come to honor \nyou, to express feelings of love and appreciation for your life.    As you take a seat and wait for the services to begin, you look at the program in your hand.  There \nare to be four speakers.  The first one is from yo ur family, immediate and al so extended -- children, \nbrothers, sisters, nephews, nieces, aunts, uncles, cousins, and grandparents who have come from all \nover the country to attend.  The second speaker is one of your friends, someone who can give a sense \nof what you were as a person.  The third speaker is from your work or profession.",

Each part of your life -- today's behavior, tomorro w's behavior, next week's behavior, next month's \nbehavior -- can be examined in the context of the whole, of what really matters most to you.  By \nkeeping that end clearly in mind, you can make ce rtain that whatever you do on any particular day \ndoes not violate the criteria you have defined as su premely important, and that each day of your life \ncontributes in a meaningful way to the vi sion you have of your life as a whole. \n   To Begin with the End in Mind  means to start with a clear unders tanding of your destination.  It \nmeans to know where you're going so that you bette r understand where you are now and so that the \nsteps you take are always in the right direction.    It's incredibly easy to get caught up in an acti vity trap, in the busy-ness of  life, to work harder and \nharder at climbing the ladder of success only to disc over it's leaning against the wrong wall.  It is \npossible to be busy -- very busy -- without being very effective. \n   People often find themselves achieving victorie s that are empty, successes that have come at the \nexpense of things they suddenly realize were far mo re valuable to them.  People from every walk of \nlife -- doctors, academicians, actors, politicians, busi ness professionals, athletes, and plumbers -- often \nstruggle to achieve a higher income, more recognitio n or a certain degree of professional competence, \nonly to find that their drive to ac hieve their goal blinded them to th e things that really mattered most \nand now are gone.    How different our lives are when we really know what is deeply important to us, and, keeping that \npicture in mind, we manage ourselves each day to be and to do what really matters most.  If the ladder \nis not leaning against the right wall, every step we take  just gets us to the wrong place faster.  We may \nbe very busy, we may be very effici ent, but we will also be truly effect ive only when we Begin with the \nEnd in Mind.    If you carefully consider what you wanted to be said of you in the funeral experience, you will find \nyour definition of success.  It may be very different  from the definition you thought you had in mind.  \nPerhaps fame, achievement, money, or some of the ot her things we strive for are not even part of the \nright wall.    When you Begin with the End in Mind, you gain  a different perspective.  One man asked another \non the death of a mutual friend, \"How much did he  leave?\" His friend responded, \"He left it all.\" \n All Things Are Created Twice     \"Begin with the End in Mind\" is based on the pr inciple that all things are created twice.  There's a \nmental or first creation, and a physical  or second creation to all things \n   Take the construction of a home, for example.  You create it in every detail before you ever hammer \nthe first nail into place.  You try to get a very cle ar sense of what kind of house you want.  If you want \na family-centered home, you plan a family room wh ere it would be a natural gathering place.  You \nplan sliding doors and a patio for children to play outside.  You work with ideas.  You work with \nyour mind until you get a clear image of what you want to build.    Then you reduce it to blueprint and develop constr uction plans.  All of this  is done before the earth \nis touched.  If not, then in the second creation, the physical creation, you will have to make expensive \nchanges that may double the cost of your home.    The carpenter's rule is \"measure twice, cut once.\"  You have to make sure th at the blueprint, the first \ncreation, is really what you want, that you've though t everything through.  Then  you put it into bricks \nand mortar.  Each day you go to the construction shed and pull out the blueprint to get marching \norders for the day.  You Begin with the End in Mind.    For another example, look at a business.  If you want to have a successful enterprise, you clearly \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P",

Each part of your life -- today's behavior, tomorro w's behavior, next week's behavior, next month's \nbehavior -- can be examined in the context of the whole, of what really matters most to you.  By \nkeeping that end clearly in mind, you can make ce rtain that whatever you do on any particular day \ndoes not violate the criteria you have defined as su premely important, and that each day of your life \ncontributes in a meaningful way to the vi sion you have of your life as a whole. \n   To Begin with the End in Mind  means to start with a clear unders tanding of your destination.  It \nmeans to know where you're going so that you bette r understand where you are now and so that the \nsteps you take are always in the right direction.    It's incredibly easy to get caught up in an acti vity trap, in the busy-ness of  life, to work harder and \nharder at climbing the ladder of success only to disc over it's leaning against the wrong wall.  It is \npossible to be busy -- very busy -- without being very effective. \n   People often find themselves achieving victorie s that are empty, successes that have come at the \nexpense of things they suddenly realize were far mo re valuable to them.  People from every walk of \nlife -- doctors, academicians, actors, politicians, busi ness professionals, athletes, and plumbers -- often \nstruggle to achieve a higher income, more recognitio n or a certain degree of professional competence, \nonly to find that their drive to ac hieve their goal blinded them to th e things that really mattered most \nand now are gone.    How different our lives are when we really know what is deeply important to us, and, keeping that \npicture in mind, we manage ourselves each day to be and to do what really matters most.  If the ladder \nis not leaning against the right wall, every step we take  just gets us to the wrong place faster.  We may \nbe very busy, we may be very effici ent",

Each part of your life -- today's behavior, tomorro w's behavior, next week's behavior, next month's \nbehavior -- can be examined in the context of the whole, of what really matters most to you.  By \nkeeping that end clearly in mind, you can make ce rtain that whatever you do on any particular day \ndoes not violate the criteria you have defined as su premely important, and that each day of your life \ncontributes in a meaningful way to the vi sion you have of your life as a whole. \n   To Begin with the End in Mind  means to start with a clear unders tanding of your destination.  It \nmeans to know where you're going so that you bette r understand where you are now and so that the \nsteps you take are always in the right direction.    It's incredibly easy to get caught up in an act",

    "text": " and to do what really matters most.  If the ladder \nis not leaning against the right wall, every step we take  just gets us to the wrong place faster.  We may \nbe very busy, we may be very effici ent, but we will also be truly effect ive only when we Begin with the \nEnd in Mind.    If you carefully consider what you wanted to be said of you in the funeral experience, you will find \nyour definition of success.  It may be very different  from the definition you thought you had in mind.  \nPerhaps fame, achievement, money, or some of the ot her things we strive for are not even part of the \nright wall.    When you Begin with the End in Mind, you gain  a different perspective.  One man asked another \non the death of a mutual friend, \"How much did he  leave?\" His friend responded, \"He left it all.\" \n All Things Are Created Twice     \"Begin with the End in Mind\" is based on the pr inciple that all things are created twice.  There's a \nmental or first creation, and a physical  or second creation to all things \n   Take the construction of a home, for example.  You create it in every detail before you ever hammer \nthe first nail into place.  You try to get a very cle ar sense of what kind of house you want.  If you want \na family-centered home, you plan a family room wh ere it would be a natural gathering place.  You \nplan sliding doors and a patio for children to play outside.  You work with ideas.  You work with \nyour mind until you get a clear image of what you want to build.    Then you reduce it to blueprint and develop constr uction plans.  All of this  is done before the earth \nis touched.  If not, then in the second creation, the physical creation, you will have to make expensive \nchanges that may double the cost of your home.    The carpenter's rule is \"measure twice, cut once.\"  You have to make sure th at the blueprint, the first \ncreation, is really what you want, that you've though t everything through.  Then  you put it into bricks \nand mortar.  Each day you go to the construction shed and pull out the blueprint to get marching \norders for the day.  You Begin with the End in Mind.    For another example, look at a business. ",

It may be very different  from the definition you thought you had in mind.  \nPerhaps fame, achievement, money, or some of the ot her things we strive for are not even part of the \nright wall.    When you Begin with the End in Mind, you gain  a different perspective.  One man asked another \non the death of a mutual friend, \"How much did he  leave?\" His friend responded, \"He left it all.\" \n All Things Are Created Twice     \"Begin with the End in Mind\" is based on the pr inciple that all things are created twice.  There's a \nmental or first creation, and a physical  or second creation to all things \n   Take the construction of a home, for example.  You create it",

You care fully think through the product or service you want \nto provide in terms of your market target, then you organize all the elements -- financial, research and \ndevelopment, operations, marketing, pe rsonnel, physical facilities, and so on -- to meet that objective.  \nThe extent to which you Begin with the End in Mind  often determines whether or not you are able to \ncreate a successful enterprise.  Most business failures begin in the first creation, with problems such as \nundercapitalization, misunderstanding of the market, or lack of a business plan. \n   The same is true with parentin g.  If you want to raise responsi ble, self-disciplined children, you \nhave to keep that end clearly in mind as you inte ract with your children on a daily basis.  You can't \nbehave toward them in ways that underm ine their self-discipline or self-esteem. \n   To varying degrees, people use this principle in  many different areas of lif e.  Before you go on a \ntrip, you determine your destination and plan out the best route.  Before you plant a garden, you plan \nit out in your mind, possibly on paper.  You crea te speeches on paper before you give them, you \nenvision the landscaping in your yard before you la ndscape it, you design the clothes you make before \nyou thread the needle.    To the extent to which we understand the princi ple of two creations and a ccept the responsibility for \nboth, we act within and enlarge the bo rders of our Circle of Influence.  To the extent to which we do \nnot operate in harmony with this principle and ta ke charge of the first creation, we diminish it. \n By Design or Default     It's a principle that all things are created twice, but not all first creations are by conscious design.  In \nour personal lives, if we do not develop our own self-awareness and become responsible for first creations, we empower other people and circumstance s outside our Circle or Influence to shape much \nof our lives by default.  We reactively live the scripts  handed to us by family, associates, other people's \nagendas, the pressures of circum stance -- scripts from our earlie r years, from our training, our \nconditioning    These scripts come from people, not principles.  And they rise out of our deep vulnerabilities, our \ndeep dependency on others and our need for acce ptance and love, for belonging, for a sense of \nimportance and worth, for a feeling that we matter.    Whether we are aware of it or not, whether we are in  control of it or not, there is a first creation to \nevery part of our lives.  We are either the second creation of our own proactive design, or we are the \nsecond creation of other people's agendas, of circumstances, or of past habits    The unique human capacities of self-awareness, imagination, and conscience enable us to examine \nfirst creations and make it possible for us to take charge of our own first creation, to write our own \nscript.  Put another way, Habit 1 says, \"You are  the creator.\" Habit 2 is the first creation. \n Leadership and Management -- The Two Creations     Habit 2 is based on principles of personal le adership, which means that leadership is the first \ncreation.  Leadership is not management.  Manage ment is the second crea tion, which we'll discuss in \nthe chapter on Habit 3.  But le adership has to come first. \n   Management is a bottom-line focus: How can I best accomplish certain things? Leadership deals \nwith the top line: What are the things I want to accomplish? In the words of both Peter Drucker and \nWarren Bennis, \"Management is doing th ings right; leadership is doin g the right things.\" Management \nis efficiency in climbing the ladder of success; leadership determines whether the ladder is leaning \nagainst the right wall.    You can quickly grasp the important differenc e between the two if you envision a group of \nproducers cutting their way through the jungle with  machetes.  They're the producers, the problem \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u ",

You care fully think through the product or service you want \nto provide in terms of your market target, then you organize all the elements -- financial, research and \ndevelopment, operations, marketing, pe rsonnel, physical facilities, and so on -- to meet that objective.  \nThe extent to which you Begin with the End in Mind  often determines whether or not you are able to \ncreate a successful enterprise.  Most business failures begin in the first creation, with problems such as \nundercapitalization, misunderstanding of the market, or lack of a business plan. \n   The same is true with parentin g.  If you want to raise responsi ble, self-disciplined children, you \nhave to keep that end clearly in mind as you inte ract with your children on a daily basis.  You can't \nbehave toward them in ways that underm ine their self-discipline or self-esteem. \n   To varying degrees, people use this principle in  many different areas of lif e.  Before you go on a \ntrip, you determine your destination and plan out the best route.  Before you plant a garden, you plan \nit out in your mind, possibly on paper.  You crea te speeches on paper before you give them, you \nenvision the landscaping in your yard before you la ndscape it, you design the clothes you make before \nyou thread the needle.    To the extent to which we understand the princi ple of two creations and a ccept the responsibility for \nboth, we act within and enlarge the bo rders of our Circle of Influence.  To the extent to which we do \nnot operate in harmony with this principle and ta ke charge of the first creation, we diminish it. \n By Design or Default     It's a principle that all things are created twice, but not all first creations are by conscious design.  In \nour personal lives, if we do not develop our own self-awareness and become responsible for first creations, we empower other people and circumstance s outside our Circle or Influence",

    "text": " are created twice, but not all first creations are by conscious design.  In \nour personal lives, if we do not develop our own self-awareness and become responsible for first creations, we empower other people and circumstance s outside our Circle or Influence to shape much \nof our lives by default.  We reactively live the scripts  handed to us by family, associates, other people's \nagendas, the pressures of circum stance -- scripts from our earlie r years, from our training, our \nconditioning    These scripts come from people, not principles.  And they rise out of our deep vulnerabilities, our \ndeep dependency on others and our need for acce ptance and love, for belonging, for a sense of \nimportance and worth, for a feeling that we matter.    Whether we are aware of it or not, whether we are in  control of it or not, there is a first creation to \nevery part of our lives.  We are either the second creation of our own proactive design, or we are the \nsecond creation of other people's agendas, of circumstances, or of past habits    The unique human capacities of self-awareness, imagination, and conscience enable us to examine \nfirst creations and make it possible for us to take charge of our own first creation, to write our own \nscript.  Put another way, Habit 1 says, \"You are  the creator.\" Habit 2 is the first creation. \n Leadership and Management -- The Two Creations     Habit 2 is based on principles of personal le adership, which means that leadership is the first \ncreation.  Leadership is not management.  Manage ment is the second crea tion, which we'll discuss in \nthe chapter on Habit 3.  But le adership has to come first. \n   Management is a bottom-line focus: How can I best accomplish certain things? Leadership deals \nwith the top line: What are the things I want to accomplish?

In \nour personal lives, if we do not develop our own self-awareness and become responsible for first creations, we empower other people and circumstance s outside our Circle or Influence to shape much \nof our lives by default.  We reactively live the scripts  handed to us by family, associates, other people's \nagendas, the pressures of circum stance -- scripts from our earlie r years, from our training, our \nconditioning    These scripts come from people, not principles.  And they rise out of our deep vulnerabilities, our \ndeep dependency on others and our need for acce ptance and love, for belonging, for a sense of \nimportance and worth, for a feeling that we matter.    Whether we are aware of it or not, whether we are in  control of it or not, there is a first creation to \nevery part of our lives.  We are either the second creation of our own proactive design, or we are the \nsecond creation of other people's agendas, of circumstances, or of past habits    The unique human capacities of self-awareness, imagination, and conscience enable us to examine \nfirst creations and make it possible for us",

    "text": " proactive design, or we are the \nsecond creation of other people's agendas, of circumstances, or of past habits    The unique human capacities of self-awareness, imagination, and conscience enable us to examine \nfirst creations and make it possible for us to take charge of our own first creation, to write our own \nscript.  Put another way, Habit 1 says, \"You are  the creator.\" Habit 2 is the first creation. \n Leadership and Management -- The Two Creations     Habit 2 is based on principles of personal le adership, which means that leadership is the first \ncreation.  Leadership is not management.  Manage ment is the second crea tion, which we'll discuss in \nthe chapter on Habit 3.  But le adership has to come first. \n   Management is a bottom-line focus: How can I best accomplish certain things? Leadership deals \nwith the top line: What are the things I want to accomplish? In the words of both Peter Drucker and \nWarren Bennis, \"Management is doing th ings right; leadership is doin g the right things.\" Management \nis efficiency in climbing the ladder of success; leadership determines whether the ladder is leaning \nagainst the right wall.

They're cutting through th e undergrowth, clearing it out. \n   The managers are behind them, sharpening thei r machetes, writing policy and procedure manuals, \nholding muscle development programs, bringing in improved technologies, and setting up working \nschedules and compensation programs for machete wielders.    The leader is the one who climbs the tallest tr ee, surveys the entire situ ation, and yells, \"Wrong \njungle!\"    But how do the busy, efficient producers and managers often respond?  \"Shut up! We're making progress.\"    As individuals, groups, and businesses, we're often so busy cutting through the undergrowth we \ndon't even realize we're in the wr ong jungle.  And the rapidly changing environment in which we live \nmakes effective leadership more critical than it ha s ever been -- in every aspect of independent and \ninterdependent life.    We are more in need of a vision or designation and a compass (a set of principles or directions) and \nless in need of a road map.  We often don't know what the terrain ahead will be like or what we will \nneed to go through it; much will depend on our judgment at the time.  But an inner compass will always give us direction.    Effectiveness -- often even survival -- does not depend solely on how much effort we expend, but on \nwhether or not the effort we expend is in the righ t jungle.  And the metamorphosis taking place in \nmost every industry and profession demand s leadership first and management second. \n   In business, the market is changing so rapidly th at many products and servic es that successfully met \nconsumer tastes and needs a few years ago are obso lete today.  Proactive powerful leadership must \nconstantly monitor environmental change, particul arly customer buying habits and motives, and \nprovide the force necessary to organize resources in the right direction.    Such changes as deregulation of  the airline industry, skyrocketing costs of health care, and the great \nquality and quantity of imported cars impact the envi ronment in significant ways.  If industries do not \nmonitor the environment, including their own work team s, and exercise the creative leadership to keep \nheaded in the right direction, no amount of ma nagement expertise can keep them from failing. \n   Efficient management without effective lead ership is, as one individual phrased it, \"like \nstraightening deck chairs on the Titanic.\" No ma nagement success can compensate for failure in \nleadership.  But leadership is hard because we're often caught in a management paradigm. \n   At the final session of a year-long executive deve lopment program in Seattle,  the president of an oil \ncompany came up to me and said, \"Stephen, when you pointed out the difference between leadership \nand management in the second month, I looked at  my role as the presid ent of this company and \nrealized that I had never been into leadership.  I was deep into management, buried by pressing \nchallenges and the details of day-to-day logistics.   So I decided to withdraw from management.  I \ncould get other people to do that.  I wanted to really lead my organization.    \"It was hard.  I went through withdrawal pains be cause I stopped dealing with a lot of the pressing, \nurgent matters that were right in front of me and wh ich gave me a sense of immediate accomplishment.  \nI didn't receive much satisfaction as I started wres tling with the direction is sues, the culture-building \nissues, the deep analysis of problems, the seizing of new opportunities.  Others also went through \nwithdrawal pains from their working style comfort zones.  They missed the easy accessibility I had \ngiven them before.  They still wanted me to be av ailable to them, to respond, to help solve their \nproblems on a day-to-day basis.    \"But I persisted.  I was absolutely convinced that I needed to provide leadership.  And I did.  \nToday our whole business is different.  We're more in line with our environment.  We have doubled \nour revenues and quadrupled our profits.  I'm into leadership.\"    I'm convinced that too often parents are also trapped in the management paradigm, thinking of \ncontrol, efficiency, and rules instead of direction, purpose, and family feeling. \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t ",

They're cutting through th e undergrowth, clearing it out. \n   The managers are behind them, sharpening thei r machetes, writing policy and procedure manuals, \nholding muscle development programs, bringing in improved technologies, and setting up working \nschedules and compensation programs for machete wielders.

    "text": " even realize we're in the wr ong jungle.  And the rapidly changing environment in which we live \nmakes effective leadership more critical than it ha s ever been -- in every aspect of independent and \ninterdependent life.    We are more in need of a vision or designation and a compass (a set of principles or directions) and \nless in need of a road map.  We often don't know what the terrain ahead will be like or what we will \nneed to go through it; much will depend on our judgment at the time.  But an inner compass will always give us direction.    Effectiveness -- often even survival -- does not depend solely on how much effort we expend, but on \nwhether or not the effort we expend is in the righ t jungle.  And the metamorphosis taking place in \nmost every industry and profession demand s leadership first and management second. \n   In business, the market is changing so rapidly th at many products and servic es that successfully met \nconsumer tastes and needs a few years ago are obso lete today.  Proactive powerful leadership must \nconstantly monitor environmental change, particul arly customer buying habits and motives, and \nprovide the force necessary to organize resources in the right direction.

    "text": " Such changes as deregulation of  the airline industry, skyrocketing costs of health care, and the great \nquality and quantity of imported cars impact the envi ronment in significant ways.  If industries do not \nmonitor the environment, including their own work team s, and exercise the creative leadership to keep \nheaded in the right direction, no amount of ma nagement expertise can keep them from failing. \n   Efficient management without effective lead ership is, as one individual phrased it, \"like \nstraightening deck chairs on the Titanic.\" No ma nagement success can compensate for failure in \nleadership.  But leadership is hard because we're often caught in a management paradigm. \n   At the final session of a year-long executive deve lopment program in Seattle,  the president of an oil \ncompany came up to me and said, \"Stephen, when you pointed out the difference between leadership \nand management in the second month, I looked at  my role as the presid ent of this company and \nrealized that I had never been into leadership.  I was deep into management, buried by pressing \nchallenges and the details of day-to-day logistics.   So I decided to withdraw from management.  I \ncould get other people to do that.  I wanted to really lead my organization.    \"It was hard.  I went through withdrawal pains be cause I stopped dealing with a lot of the pressing, \nurgent matters that were right in front of me and wh ich gave me a sense of immediate accomplishment.  \nI didn't receive much satisfaction as I started wres tling with the direction is sues, the culture-building \nissues, the deep analysis of problems, the seizing of new opportunities.  Others also went through \nwithdrawal pains from their working style comfort zones.  They missed the easy accessibility I had \ngiven them before.  They still wanted me to be av ailable to them, to respond, to help solve their \nproblems on a day-to-day basis.    \"But I persisted.  I was absolutely convinced that I needed to provide leadership.  And I did.  \nToday our whole business is different.  We're more in line with our environment.  We have doubled \nour revenues and quadrupled our profits.  I'm into leadership.\"    I'm convinced that too often parents are also trapped in the management paradigm, thinking of \ncontrol, efficiency, and rules instead of direction, purpose, and family feeling. \nT H",

We're into managing with efficiency, \nsetting and achieving goals before we have even clarified our values. \n Rescripting:  Becoming Your Own First Creator     As we previously observed, proactivity is based on the unique human endowment of self-awareness.  \nThe two additional unique human endo wments that enable us to expand  our proactivity and to exercise \npersonal leadership in our lives  are imagination and conscience. \n   Through imagination, we can visualize the uncr eated worlds of potential that lie within us.  \nThrough conscience, we can come in contact with univ ersal laws or principles with our own singular \ntalents and avenues of contribution, and with th e personal guidelines within which we can most \neffectively develop them.  Combined with self-aw areness, these two endowmen ts empower us to write \nour own script.    Because we already live with many scripts that ha ve been handed to us, the process of writing our \nown script is actually more a process of \"rescripting,\"  or Paradigm Shifting -- of changing some of the \nbasic paradigms that we already have.  As we reco gnize the ineffective scripts, the incorrect or \nincomplete paradigms within us, we can pr oactively begin to rescript ourselves. \n   I think one of the most inspiring accounts of the rescripting process comes from the autobiography \nof Anwar Sadat, past president of Egypt.  Sadat ha d been reared, nurtured, an d deeply scripted in a \nhatred for Israel.  He would make the statement on na tional television, \"I will never shake the hand of \na n  I s r a e l i  a s  l o n g  a s  t h e y  o c c u p y  o n e  i n ch  o f  A rab soil.  Never, never, never!\" And huge crowds all \naround the country would chant, \"Never, never, neve r!\" He marshaled the energy and unified the will \nof the whole country in that script.    The script was very independent and nationalistic,  and it aroused deep emotions in the people.  But \nit was also very foolish, and Sadat knew it.  It igno red the perilous, highly interdependent reality of the \nsituation.    So he rescripted himself.  It was a process he  had learned when he was a young man imprisoned in \nCell 54, a solitary cell in Cairo Central Prison, as a resu lt of his involvement in a conspiracy plot against \nKing Farouk.  He learned to withdraw from his ow n mind and look at it to see if the scripts were \nappropriate and wise.  He learned how to vacate hi s own mind and, through a deep personal process \nof meditation, to work with his own scriptures,  his own form of prayer, and rescript himself. \n   He records that he was almost loath to leave his prison cell because it was there that he realized that \nreal success is success with self.  It's not in having  things, but in having mastery, having victory over \nself.    For a period of time during Nasser's administrat ion Sadat was relegated to a position of relative \ninsignificance.  Everyone felt that his spirit was br oken, but it wasn't.  They  were projecting their own \nhome movies onto him.  They didn't understand him.  He was biding his time.    And when that time came, when  he became president of Egypt and confronted the political realities, \nhe rescripted himself toward Israel.  He visited th e Knesset in Jerusalem and opened up one of the \nmost precedent-breaking peace moveme nts in the history of the world, a bold initiative that eventually \nbrought about the Camp David Accord.    Sadat was able to use his self-awareness, his im agination, and his conscien ce to exercise personal \nleadership, to change an essential paradigm, to change the way he saw the situation.  He worked in the \ncenter of his Circle of Influence.  And from that rescripting, that change in  paradigm, flowed changes \nin behavior and attitude that affected millions  of lives in the wider Circle of Concern. \n   In developing our own self-awareness many of  us discover ineffective scripts, deeply embedded \nhabits that are totally unworthy of us, totally incongruent with",

We're into managing with efficiency, \nsetting and achieving goals before we have even clarified our values. \n Rescripting:  Becoming Your Own First Creator     As we previously observed, proactivity is based on the unique human endowment of self-awareness.  \nThe two additional unique human endo wments that enable us to expand  our proactivity and to exercise \npersonal leadership in our lives  are imagination and conscience. \n   Through imagination, we can visualize the uncr eated worlds of potential that lie within us.  \nThrough conscience, we can come in contact with univ ersal laws or principles with our own singular \ntalents and avenues of contribution, and with th e personal guidelines within which we can most \neffectively develop them.

Sadat ha d been reared, nurtured, an d deeply scripted in a \nhatred for Israel.  He would make the statement on na tional television, \"I will never shake the hand of \na n  I s r a e l i  a s  l o n g  a s  t h e y  o c c u p y  o n e  i n ch  o f  A rab soil.

Never, never, never!\" And huge crowds all \naround the country would chant, \"Never, never, neve r!\" He marshaled the energy and unified the will \nof the whole country in that script.    The script was very independent and nationalistic,  and it aroused deep emotions in the people.  But \nit was also very foolish, and Sadat knew it.  It igno red the perilous, highly interdependent reality of the \nsituation.    So he rescripted himself.  It was a process he  had learned when he was a young man imprisoned in \nCell 54, a solitary cell in Cairo Central Prison, as a resu lt of his involvement in a conspiracy plot against \nKing Farouk.  He learned to withdraw from his ow n mind and look at it to see if the scripts were \nappropriate and wise.  He learned how to vacate hi s own mind and, through a deep personal process \nof meditation, to work with his own scriptures,  his own form of prayer, and rescript himself. \n   He records that he was almost loath to leave his prison cell because it was there that he realized that \nreal success is success with self.  It's not in having  things, but in having mastery, having victory over \nself.    For a period of time during Nasser's administrat ion Sadat was relegated to a position of relative \ninsignificance.  Everyone felt that his spirit was br oken, but it wasn't.  They  were projecting their own \nhome movies onto him.  They didn't understand him.  He was biding his time.    And when that time came, when  he became president of Egypt and confronted the political realities, \nhe rescripted himself toward Israel.  He visited th e Knesset in Jerusalem and opened up one of the \nmost precedent-breaking peace moveme nts in the history of the world, a bold initiative that eventually \nbrought about the Camp David Accord.    Sadat was able to use his self-awareness, his im agination, and his conscien ce to exercise personal \nleadership, to change an essential paradigm, to change the way he saw the situation.  He worked in the \ncenter of his Circle of Influence.  And from that rescripting, that change in  paradigm, flowed changes \nin behavior",

Habit \n2 says we don't have to live with those scripts.  We are response-able to use our imagination and \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \ncreativity to write new ones that are more effective,  more congruent with our deepest values and with \nthe correct principles that give our values meaning.    Suppose, for example, that I am highly overreac tive to my children.  Suppose that whenever they \nbegin to do something I feel is inappropriate, I sens e an immediate tensing in the pit of my stomach.  I \nfeel defensive walls go up; I prepare for battle.  My focus is not on th e long-term growth and \nunderstanding but on the short-term behavior.  I'm trying to win the battle, not the war. \n   I pull out my ammunition -- my superior size, my position of authority -- and I yell or intimidate or I \nthreaten or punish.  And I win.  I stand there, vi ctorious, in the middle of the debris of a shattered \nrelationship while my children are outwardly submi ssive and inwardly rebellious, suppressing feelings \nthat will come out later in uglier ways.    Now if I were sitting at that funeral we visu alized earlier, and one of my children was about to \nspeak, I would want his life to represent the victor y of teaching, training, an d disciplining with love \nover a period of years rather than the battle scars of  quick-fix skirmishes.  I would want his heart and \nmind to be filled with the pleasant memories of d eep, meaningful times together.  I would want him to \nremember me as a loving father who shared the fun and the pain of growing up.  I would want him to \nremember the times he came to me  with his problems and concerns.  I would want to have listened \nand loved and helped.  I would want him to know I wa sn't perfect, but that I had tried with everything \nI had.  And that, perhaps more than anybody in the world, I loved him.    The reason I would want those things is becaus e, deep down, I value my children.  I love them, I \nwant to help them.  I value my role as their father.    But I don't always see those values.  I get caught up in the \"thick of thin things.\" What matters most \ngets buried under layers of pressing problems, im mediate concerns, and outward behaviors.  I become \nreactive.  And the way I interact with my children ev ery day often bears little resemblance to the way I \ndeeply feel about them.    Because I am self-aware, because I have imag ination and conscience, I can examine my deepest \nvalues.  I can realize that the script I'm living is no t in harmony with those values, that my life is not \nthe product of my own proactive design, but the re sult of the first creation I have deferred to \ncircumstances and other people.  And I can change.  I can live out of my imagination instead of my \nmemory.  I can tie myself to my limitless potential instead of my limiting past.  I can become my own \nfirst creator.    To Begin with the End in Mind means to approach  my role as a parent, as well as my other roles in \nlife, with my values and directions clear.  It mean s to be responsible for my own first creation, to \nrescript myself so that the paradigms from which my behavior and attitude flow are congruent with my \ndeepest values and in harmony with correct principles.    It also means to begin each day with those values  firmly in mind.  Then as  the vicissitudes, as the \nchallenges come, I can make my decisions based on those values.  I can act with integrity.  I don't \nhave to react to the emotion, the circumstance.  I can be truly proactive, value driven, because my \nvalues are clear.  A Personal Mission Statement     The most effective way I know to Begin with the End in Mind is to develop a personal mission \nstatement or philosophy or creed.  It focuses on  what you want to be (character) and to do \n(contributions and achievements) and",

Habit \n2 says we don't have to live with those scripts.  We are response-able to use our imagination and \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \ncreativity to write new ones that are more effective,  more congruent with our deepest values and with \nthe correct principles that give our values meaning.

My focus is not on th e long-term growth and \nunderstanding but on the short-term behavior.  I'm trying to win the battle, not the war. \n   I pull out my ammunition -- my superior size, my position of authority -- and I yell or intimidate or I \nthreaten or punish.  And I win.  I stand there, vi ctorious, in the middle of the debris of a shattered \nrelationship while my children are outwardly submi ssive and inwardly rebellious, suppressing feelings \nthat will come out later in uglier ways.    Now if I were sitting at that funeral we visu alized earlier, and one of my children was about to \nspeak, I would want his life to represent the victor y of teaching, training, an d disciplining with love \nover a period of years rather than the battle scars of  quick-fix skirmishes.  I would want his heart and \nmind to be filled with the pleasant memories of d eep, meaningful times together.  I would want him to \nremember me as a loving father who shared the fun and the pain of growing up.  I would want him to \nremember the times he came to me  with his problems and concerns.

I \nfeel defensive walls go up; I prepare for battle.  My focus is not on th e long-term growth and \nunderstanding but on the short-term behavior.  I'm trying to win the battle, not the war. \n   I pull out my ammunition -- my superior size, my position of authority -- and I yell or intimidate or I \nthreaten or punish.  And I win.  I stand there, vi ctorious, in the middle of the debris of a shattered \nrelationship while my children are outwardly submi ssive and inwardly rebellious, suppressing feelings \nthat will come out later in uglier ways.    Now if I were sitting at that funeral we visu alized earlier, and one of my children was about to \nspeak, I would want his life to represent the victor y of teaching, training, an d disciplining with love \nover a period of years rather than the battle scars of  quick-fix skirmishes.  I would want his heart and \nmind to be filled with the pleasant memories of d eep, meaningful times together.",

    "text": "  I would want him to \nremember me as a loving father who shared the fun and the pain of growing up.  I would want him to \nremember the times he came to me  with his problems and concerns.  I would want to have listened \nand loved and helped.  I would want him to know I wa sn't perfect, but that I had tried with everything \nI had.  And that, perhaps more than anybody in the world, I loved him.    The reason I would want those things is becaus e, deep down, I value my children.  I love them, I \nwant to help them.  I value my role as their father.    But I don't always see those values.  I get caught up in the \"thick of thin things.\" What matters most \ngets buried under layers of pressing problems, im mediate concerns, and outward behaviors.  I become \nreactive.  And the way I interact with my children ev ery day often bears little resemblance to the way I \ndeeply feel about them.    Because I am self-aware, because I have imag ination and conscience, I can examine my deepest \nvalues.  I can realize that the script I'm living is no t in harmony with those values, that my life is not \nthe product of my own proactive design, but the re sult of the first creation I have deferred to \ncircumstances and other people.  And I can change.  I can live out of my imagination instead of my \nmemory.  I can tie myself to my limitless potential instead of my limiting past.  I can become my own \nfirst creator.    To Begin with the End in Mind means to approach  my role as a parent, as well as my other roles in \nlife, with my values and directions clear.  It mean s to be responsible for my own first creation, to \nrescript myself so that the paradigms from which my behavior and attitude flow are congruent with my \ndeepest values and in harmony with correct principles.    It also means to begin each day with those values  firmly in mind.  Then as  the vicissitudes, as the \nchallenges come, I can make my decisions based on those values.  I can act with integrity.  I don't \nhave to react to the emotion, the circumstance.  I can be truly proactive, value driven, because my \nvalues are clear.  A Personal Mission Statement    ",

I would want him to \nremember the times he came to me  with his problems and concerns.  I would want to have listened \nand loved and helped.  I would want him to know I wa sn't perfect, but that I had tried with everything \nI had.  And that, perhaps more than anybody in the world, I loved him.    The reason I would want those things is becaus e, deep down, I value my children.  I love them, I \nwant to help them.  I value my role as their father.    But I don't always see those values.  I get caught up in the \"thick of thin things.\" What matters most \ngets buried under layers of pressing problems, im mediate concerns, and outward behaviors.  I become \nreactive.  And the way I interact with my children ev ery day often bears little resemblance to the way I \ndeeply feel about them.    Because I am self-aware, because I have imag ination and conscience, I can examine my deepest \nvalues.  I can realize that the script I'm living is no",

I can realize that the script I'm living is no t in harmony with those values, that my life is not \nthe product of my own proactive design, but the re sult of the first creation I have deferred to \ncircumstances and other people.  And I can change.  I can live out of my imagination instead of my \nmemory.  I can tie myself to my limitless potential instead of my limiting past.  I can become my own \nfirst creator.    To Begin with the End in Mind means to approach  my role as a parent, as well as my other roles in \nlife, with my values and directions clear.  It mean s to be responsible for my own first creation, to \nrescript myself so that the paradigms from which my behavior and attitude flow are congruent with my \ndeepest values and in harmony with correct principles.    It also means to begin each day with those values  firmly in mind.  Then as  the vicissitudes, as the \nchallenges come, I can make my decisions",

    "text": " The most effective way I know to Begin with the End in Mind is to develop a personal mission \nstatement or philosophy or creed.  It focuses on  what you want to be (character) and to do \n(contributions and achievements) and on the values  or principles upon which being and doing are \nbased    Because each individual is unique, a personal mi ssion statement will reflect that uniqueness, both in \ncontent and form.  My friend, Rolfe Kerr, has expressed his personal creed in this way: \n   Succeed at home first.  \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n   Seek and merit divine help. \n   Never compromise with honesty.    Remember the people involved.    Hear both sides before judging.    Obtain counsel of others.    Defend those who are absent.    Be sincere yet decisive.    Develop one new proficiency a year.    Plan tomorrow's work today.    Hustle while you wait.    Maintain a positive attitude.     Keep a sense of humor.    Be orderly in person and in work.    Do not fear mistakes -- fear on ly the absence of creative, constructive, and corrective responses to \nthose mistakes.    Facilitate the success of subordinates.    Listen twice as much as you speak.    Concentrate all abilities and efforts on the ta sk at hand, not worrying about the next job or \npromotion.    A woman seeking to balance family and work va lues has expressed her sense of personal mission \ndifferently:    I will seek to balance career and family as best I can since both are important to me.    My home will be a place where I and my family, friends, and guests find joy, comfort, peace, and \nhappiness.  Still I will seek to create a clean and or derly environment, yet livable and comfortable.  I \nwill exercise wisdom in what we choose to eat, read, see, and do at home.  I especially want to teach \nmy children to love, to learn, and to laugh -- and to work and develop their unique talents.    I value the rights, freedoms, and responsibilities of our democratic society.  I will be a concerned \nand informed citizen, involved in the political proc ess to ensure my voice is  heard and my vote is \ncounted.    I will be a self-starting individual who exercises initiative in accomplishing my life's goals.  I will \nact on situations and opportunitie s, rather than to be acted upon. \n   I will always try to keep myself free from addi ctive and destructive habits.  I will develop habits \nthat free me from old labels and limits and expand my capabilities and choices.    My money will be my servant, not my master.  I will seek financial independence over time.  My \nwants will be subject to my needs and my means.  Ex cept for long-term home and car loans, I will seek \nto keep myself free from consumer debt.  I will spend less than I earn and regularly save or invest part \nof my income.    Moreover, I will use what money and talents I ha ve to make life more en joyable for others through \nservice and charitable giving.    You could call a personal mission statement a personal constitution.  Like the United States \nConstitution, it's fundamentally changeless.  In over 200 years, there have been only 26 amendments, \n10 of which were in the original Bill of Rights.    The United States Constitution is the standard by which every law in the country is evaluated.  It is \nthe document the president agrees to defend and suppo rt when he takes the Oath of Allegiance.  It is \nthe criterion by which people are admitted into citize nship.  It is the foundation and the center that \nenables people to ride through such major traumas as the Civil War, Vietnam, or Watergate.  It is the \nwritten standard, the key criterion by which everything else is evaluated and directed. \n   The Constitution has endured and serves its vi tal function today because it is based on correct \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \nprinciples, on the self-evident truths contained in  the Declaration of Independ ence.  These principles \nempower the Constitution with a ti meless strength, even in the midst of social ambiguity and change",

    "text": " The most effective way I know to Begin with the End in Mind is to develop a personal mission \nstatement or philosophy or creed.  It focuses on  what you want to be (character) and to do \n(contributions and achievements) and on the values  or principles upon which being and doing are \nbased    Because each individual is unique, a personal mi ssion statement will reflect that uniqueness, both in \ncontent and form.  My friend, Rolfe Kerr, has expressed his personal creed in this way: \n   Succeed at home first.  \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n   Seek and merit divine help. \n   Never compromise with honesty.    Remember the people involved.    Hear both sides before judging.    Obtain counsel of others.    Defend those who are absent.    Be sincere yet decisive.    Develop one new proficiency a year.    Plan tomorrow's work today.    Hustle while you wait.    Maintain a positive attitude.     Keep a sense of humor.    Be orderly in person and in work.    Do not fear mistakes -- fear on ly the absence of creative, constructive, and corrective responses to \nthose mistakes.    Facilitate the success of subordinates.    Listen twice as much as you speak.    Concentrate all abilities and efforts on the ta sk at hand, not worrying about the next job or \npromotion.    A woman seeking to balance family and work va lues has expressed her sense of personal mission \ndifferently:    I will seek to balance career and family as best I can since both are important to me.    My home will be a place where I and my family, friends, and guests find joy, comfort, peace, and \nhappiness.  Still I will seek to create a clean and or derly environment, yet livable and comfortable.  I \nwill exercise wisdom in what we choose to eat, read, see, and do at home.  I especially want to teach \nmy children to love, to learn, and to laugh -- and to work and develop their unique talents.    I value the rights, freedoms, and responsibilities of our democratic society.  I will be a concerned \nand informed",

    "text": " The most effective way I know to Begin with the End in Mind is to develop a personal mission \nstatement or philosophy or creed.  It focuses on  what you want to be (character) and to do \n(contributions and achievements) and on the values  or principles upon which being and doing are \nbased    Because each individual is unique, a personal mi ssion statement will reflect that uniqueness, both in \ncontent and form.  My friend, Rolfe Kerr, has expressed his personal creed in this way: \n   Succeed at home first.  \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n   Seek and merit divine help. \n   Never compromise with honesty.    Remember the people involved.    Hear both sides before judging.    Obtain counsel of others.    Defend those who are absent.    Be sincere yet decisive.    Develop one new proficiency a year.    Plan tomorrow's work today.    Hustle while you wait.   ",

I value the rights, freedoms, and responsibilities of our democratic society.  I will be a concerned \nand informed citizen, involved in the political proc ess to ensure my voice is  heard and my vote is \ncounted.    I will be a self-starting individual who exercises initiative in accomplishing my life's goals.  I will \nact on situations and opportunitie s, rather than to be acted upon. \n   I will always try to keep myself free from addi ctive and destructive habits.  I will develop habits \nthat free me from old labels and limits and expand my capabilities and choices.    My money will be my servant, not my master.  I will seek financial independence over time.  My \nwants will be subject to my needs and my means.  Ex cept for long-term home and car loans, I will seek \nto keep myself free from consumer debt.  I will spend less than I earn and regularly save or invest part \nof my income.    Moreover, I will use what money and talents I ha ve to make life more en joyable for others through \nservice and charitable giving.

The United States Constitution is the standard by which every law in the country is evaluated.  It is \nthe document the president agrees to defend and suppo rt when he takes the Oath of Allegiance.  It is \nthe criterion by which people are admitted into citize nship.  It is the foundation and the center that \nenables people to ride through such major traumas as the Civil War, Vietnam, or Watergate.  It is the \nwritten standard, the key criterion by which everything else is evaluated and directed. \n   The Constitution has endured and serves its vi tal function today because it is based on correct \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H",

    "text": " e a r t  \nprinciples, on the self-evident truths contained in  the Declaration of Independ ence.  These principles \nempower the Constitution with a ti meless strength, even in the midst of social ambiguity and change.  \n\"Our peculiar security,\" said Thomas Jefferson, \"is in the possession of a written Constitution.\" \n   A personal mission statement based on correct pr inciples becomes the same kind of standard for an \nindividual.  It becomes a personal constitution, the basis for making major, life-directing decisions, the \nbasis for making daily decisions in the midst of the circumstances and em otions that affect our lives.  It \nempowers individuals with the same timele ss strength in the midst of change.  \n   People can't live with change if there's not a ch angeless core inside them.  The key to the ability to \nchange is a changeless sense of who you are , what you are about and what you value. \n   With a mission statement, we can flow with chan ges.  We don't need prejudgments or prejudices.  \nWe don't need to figure out everything else in life, to stereotype and categorize everything and \neverybody in order to accommodate reality    Our personal environment is also changing at an ever-increasing pace.  Such rapid change burns \nout a large number of people who feel they can hard ly handle it, can hardly cope with life.  They \nbecome reactive and essentially give up, hoping th at the things that happen to them will be good. \n   But it doesn't have to be that way.  In the Nazi death camps where Viktor Frankl learned the \nprinciple of proactivity, he also learned the importan ce of purpose, of meaning in life.  The essence of \n\"logotherapy,\" the philosophy he later developed an d taught, is that many so-called mental and \nemotional illnesses are really symptoms of an unde rlying sense of meaninglessness or emptiness.  \nLogotherapy eliminates that emptiness by helping th e individual to detect his unique meaning, his \nmission in life.    Once you have that sense of mission, you have the essence of your own proactivity.  You have the \nvision and the values which direct your life.  Yo u have the basic direction from which you set your \nlong- and short-term goals.  You have the power of a written constitution based on correct principles, \nagainst which every decision concerning the most e ffective use of your time, your talents, and your \nenergies can be effectively measured.  At the Center     In order to write a personal mission statement, we must begin at the very center of our Circle of \nInfluence, that center comprised of our most ba sic Our paradigms, the lens through which we see the \nworld.    It is here that we deal with our vision and ou r values.  It is here that we use our endowment of \nself-awareness to examine our maps and, if we value correct principles, to make certain that our maps \naccurately describe the territory, that our paradigms are based on principles  and reality.  It is here that \nwe use our endowment of conscience as a compass to help us detect our own unique talents and areas \nof contribution.  It is here th at we use our endowment of imaginat ion to mentally create the end we \ndesire, giving direction and purpose to our begi nnings and providing the substance of a written \npersonal constitution.    It is also here that our focused efforts achiev e the greatest results.  As we work within the very \ncenter of our Circle of Influence, we expand it .  This is highest-leverage PC work, significantly \nimpacting the effectiveness of every aspect of our lives.    Whatever is at the center of our life will be th e source of our security, guidance, wisdom, and power. \n   Security represents your sense of worth, your identity, your emotional anchorage, your self-esteem, \nyour basic personal strength or lack of it.    Guidance means your source of direction in life.   Encompassed by your map, your internal frame of \nreference that interprets for you what is happening out there, are standards or principles or implicit \ncriteria that govern moment-by-moment decision-making and doing. \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n   Wisdom is your perspective on life, your sens e of balance, your understanding of how the various \nparts and principles apply and relate to each  other.  It embraces judgment, discernment, \ncomprehension.  It is a gestalt or oneness, an integrated wholeness.",

These principles \nempower the Constitution with a ti meless strength, even in the midst of social ambiguity and change.  \n\"Our peculiar security,\" said Thomas Jefferson, \"is in the possession of a written Constitution.\" \n   A personal mission statement based on correct pr inciples becomes the same kind of standard for an \nindividual.  It becomes a personal constitution, the basis for making major, life-directing decisions, the \nbasis for making daily decisions in the midst of the circumstances and em otions that affect our lives.

Once you have that sense of mission, you have the essence of your own proactivity.  You have the \nvision and the values which direct your life.

These principles \nempower the Constitution with a ti meless strength, even in the midst of social ambiguity and change.  \n\"Our peculiar security,\" said Thomas Jefferson, \"is in the possession of a written Constitution.\" \n   A personal mission statement based on correct pr inciples becomes the same kind of standard for an \nindividual.  It becomes a personal constitution, the basis for making major, life-directing decisions, the \nbasis for making daily decisions in the midst of the circumstances and em otions that affect our lives.  It \nempowers individuals with the same timele ss strength in the midst of change.  \n   People can't live with change if there's not a ch angeless core inside them.  The key to the ability to \nchange is a changeless sense of who you are , what you are about and what you value. \n   With a mission statement, we can flow with chan ges.  We don't need prejudgments or prejudices.  \nWe don't need to figure out everything else in life, to stereotype and categorize everything and \neverybody in order to accommodate reality    Our personal environment",

    "text": " of balance, your understanding of how the various \nparts and principles apply and relate to each  other.  It embraces judgment, discernment, \ncomprehension.  It is a gestalt or oneness, an integrated wholeness. \n   Power is the faculty or capacity to act, the stre ngth and potency to accomplish something.  It is the \nvital energy to make choices and decisions.  It  also includes the capacity to overcome deeply \nembedded habits and to cultivat e higher, more effective ones. \n   These four factors -- security, guidance, wisd om, and power -- are interdependent.  Security and \nclear guidance bring true wisdom, and wisdom beco mes the spark or catalyst to release and direct \npower.  When these four factors are present togeth er, harmonized and enlivened by each other, they \ncreate the great force of a noble personality, a ba lanced character, a beautifully integrated individual. \n   These life-support factors also undergird every ot her dimension of life.  And none of them is an \nall-or-nothing matter.  The degree to which you have  developed each one could be charted somewhere \non a continuum, much like the Maturity Continuum de scribed earlier.  At the bottom end, the four \nfactors are weak.  You are basically dependent on circumstances or other people, things over which \nyou have no direct control.  At the top end you are  in control.  You have independent strength and \nthe foundation for rich, inte rdependent relationships. \n   Your security lies somewhere on the continuum between extreme insecurity  on one end, wherein \nyour life is buffeted by all the fickle forces that pl ay upon it, and a deep sense of high intrinsic worth \nand personal security on the other end.  Your guidance ranges on the continuum from dependence on \nthe social mirror or other unstable, fluctuating sources to strong inne r direction.  Your wisdom falls \nsomewhere between a totally inaccurate map where ev erything is distorted and nothing seems to fit, \nand a complete and accurate map of lif e wherein all the parts and principl es are properly related to each \nother.  Your power lies somewhere between immobilization or being a puppet pulled by someone else's strings to high proactivity, the power to act according to your own values instead of being acted \nupon by other people and circumstances.    The location of these factors on the continuum, the resulting degree of their integration, harmony, \nand balance, and their positive impact on every aspect  of your life is a function of your center, the basic \nparadigms at your very core.  Alternative Centers     Each of us has a center, though we usually don' t recognize it as such.  Neither do we recognize the \nall-encompassing effects of that center on every aspect of our lives.    Let's briefly examine several centers or co re paradigms people typically have for a better \nunderstanding of how they affect these four fundame ntal dimensions and, ultimately, the sum of life \nthat flows from them.    Spouse Centeredness.  Marriage can be the most  intimate, the most satisf ying, the most enduring, \ngrowth-producing of human relationships.  It might seem natural and proper to be centered on one's \nhusband or wife.    But experience and observation tell a different story.  Over the years, I have been involved in \nworking with many troubled marriages, and I have observed a certain thread weaving itself through \nalmost every spouse-centered relationship I have encountered.  That thread is strong emotional \ndependence.    If our sense of emotional worth comes primar ily from our marriage, then we become highly \ndependent upon that relationship.  We become vuln erable to the moods and feelings, the behavior and \ntreatment of our spouse, or to any external event that may impinge on the re lationship -- a new child, \nin-laws, economic setbacks, social successes, and so forth.    When responsibilities increase and stresses come in the marriage, we tend to revert to the scripts we \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \nwere given as we were growing up.  But so does our spouse.  And those scripts are usually different.  \nDifferent ways of handling financial, child-discipline, or in-law issues come to the surface.  When these \ndeep-seated tendencies combine with the emotional dependency in the marriage, the spouse-centered \nrelationship reveals all its vulnerability.    When we are dependent on the person with wh om we are in conflict, both need and conflict are \ncompounded.",

    "text": " of balance, your understanding of how the various \nparts and principles apply and relate to each  other.  It embraces judgment, discernment, \ncomprehension.  It is a gestalt or oneness, an integrated wholeness. \n   Power is the faculty or capacity to act, the stre ngth and potency to accomplish something.  It is the \nvital energy to make choices and decisions.  It  also includes the capacity to overcome deeply \nembedded habits and to cultivat e higher, more effective ones. \n   These four factors -- security, guidance, wisd om, and power -- are interdependent.  Security and \nclear guidance bring true wisdom, and wisdom beco mes the spark or catalyst to release and direct \npower.  When these four factors are present togeth er, harmonized and enlivened by each other, they \ncreate the great force of a noble personality, a ba lanced character, a beautifully integrated individual. \n   These life-support factors also undergird every ot her dimension of life.  And none of them is an \nall-or-nothing matter.  The degree to which you have  developed each one could be charted somewhere \non a continuum, much like the Maturity Continuum de scribed earlier.  At the bottom end, the four \nfactors are weak.  You are basically dependent on circumstances or other people, things over which \nyou have no direct control.  At the top end you are  in control.  You have independent strength and \nthe foundation for rich, inte rdependent relationships. \n   Your security lies somewhere on the continuum between extreme insecurity  on one end, wherein \nyour life is buffeted by all the fickle forces that pl ay upon it, and a deep sense of high intrinsic worth \nand personal security on the other end.  Your guidance ranges on the continuum from dependence on \nthe social mirror or other unstable, fluctuating sources to strong inne r direction.  Your wisdom falls \nsomewhere between a totally inaccurate map where ev erything is distorted and nothing seems to fit, \nand a complete and accurate map of lif e wherein all the parts and principl es are properly related to each \nother.  Your power lies somewhere between immobilization or being a puppet pulled by someone else's strings to high proactivity, the power to act according to your own values instead of being acted \nupon by other people and circumstances.    The location of these factors on the continuum,",

The degree to which you have  developed each one could be charted somewhere \non a continuum, much like the Maturity Continuum de scribed earlier.  At the bottom end, the four \nfactors are weak.  You are basically dependent on circumstances or other people, things over which \nyou have no direct control.  At the top end you are  in control.  You have independent strength and \nthe foundation for rich, inte rdependent relationships. \n   Your security lies somewhere on the continuum between extreme insecurity  on one end, wherein \nyour life is buffeted by all the fickle forces that pl ay upon it, and a deep sense of high intrinsic worth \nand personal security on the other end.  Your guidance ranges on the continuum from dependence on \nthe social mirror or other unstable, fluctuating sources to strong inne r direction.  Your wisdom falls \nsomewhere between a totally inaccurate map where ev erything is distorted and nothing seems to fit, \nand a complete and accurate map of lif e wherein all the parts and principl es are properly related to each \nother.

Alternative Centers     Each of us has a center, though we usually don' t recognize it as such.  Neither do we recognize the \nall-encompassing effects of that center on every aspect of our lives.    Let's briefly examine several centers or co re paradigms people typically have for a better \nunderstanding of how they affect these four fundame ntal dimensions and, ultimately, the sum of life \nthat flows from them.

    "text": " these \ndeep-seated tendencies combine with the emotional dependency in the marriage, the spouse-centered \nrelationship reveals all its vulnerability.    When we are dependent on the person with wh om we are in conflict, both need and conflict are \ncompounded.  Love-hate overreactions, fight-or -flight tendencies, withdrawal, aggressiveness, \nbitterness, resentment, and cold comp etition are some of the usual results.  When these occur, we tend \nto fall even further back on background tendencies an d habits in an effort to justify and defend our own \nbehavior and we attack our spouse's.    I n e v i t a b l\ny, anytime we are too vulnerable we feel the need to protect ourselves fr om further wounds.  \nSo we resort to sarcasm, cutting humor, criticis m -- anything that will keep from exposing the \ntenderness within.  Each partner te nds to wait on the initiative of the other for love, only to be \ndisappointed but also confirmed as to the rightness of the accusations made.    There is only phantom security in such a relationship when all appears to be going well.  Guidance \nis based on the emotion of the moment.  Wisdom an d power are lost in the counterdependent negative \ninteractions.    Family Centeredness.  Another common center is  the family.  This, too, may seem to be natural \nand proper.  As an area of focus and deep invest ment, it provides great opportunities for deep \nrelationships, for loving, for sharing, for much that makes life worthwhile.  But as a center, it ironically \ndestroys the very elements necessary to family success.    People who are family-centered get their sense of security or personal worth from the family \ntradition and culture or the family reputation.  Thus , they become vulnerable to any changes in that \ntradition or culture and to any influenc es that would affect that reputation. \n   Family-centered parents do not have the emotio nal freedom, the power, to raise their children with \ntheir ultimate welfare truly in mind.  If they derive  their own security from the family, their need to be \npopular with their children may ove rride the importance of a long-ter m investment in their children's \ngrowth and development.  Or they may be focused on  the proper and correct behavior of the moment.  \nAny behavior that they consider improper threatens their security.  They become upset, guided by the \nemotions of the moment, spontaneously reacting to  the immediate concern rather than the long-term \ngrowth and development of the child.  They may ove rreact and punish out of bad temper.  They tend \nto love their children conditionally, making them  emotionally dependent or counterdependent and \nrebellious.    Money Centeredness.  Another logical and extr emely common center to people's lives is making \nmoney.  Economic security is basic to one's opport unity to do much in any other dimension.  In a \nhierarchy or continuum of needs, physical survival and financial security comes first.  Other needs are \nnot even activated until that basic need is satisfied, at least minimally.    Most of us face economic worries.  Many fo rces in the wider culture can and do act upon our \neconomic situation, causing or threatening such di sruption that we often expe rience concern and worry \nthat may not always rise to the conscious surface.    Sometimes there are apparently noble reasons give n for making money, such as the desire to take \ncare of one's family.  And these things are importan t.  But to focus on money-making as a center will \nbring about its own undoing.    Consider again the four life-support factors -- security, guidance, wisd om, and power.  Suppose I \nderive much of my security from my employment or from my income or net worth.  Since many \nfactors affect these economic foun dations, I become anxious and uneasy, protective and defensive, \nabout anything that may affect th em.  When my sense of personal worth comes from my net worth, I \nam vulnerable to anything that w ill affect that net worth.  But wo rk and money, per se, provide no \nwisdom, no guidance, and only a limited degree of power and security.  All it takes to show the \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \nlimitations of a money center is a crisis in my life or in the life of a loved one. \n   Money-centered people often put aside fam ily or other priorities, assuming everyone will \nunderstand that economic demands come first.

When we are dependent on the person with wh om we are in conflict, both need and conflict are \ncompounded.  Love-hate overreactions, fight-or -flight tendencies, withdrawal, aggressiveness, \nbitterness, resentment, and cold comp etition are some of the usual results.  When these occur, we tend \nto fall even further back on background tendencies an d habits in an effort to justify and defend our own \nbehavior and we attack our spouse's.    I n e v i t a b l\ny, anytime we are too vulnerable we feel the need to protect ourselves fr om further wounds.  \nSo we resort to sarcasm, cutting humor, criticis m -- anything that will keep from exposing the \ntenderness within.

But as a center, it ironically \ndestroys the very elements necessary to family success.    People who are family-centered get their sense of security or personal worth from the family \ntradition and culture or the family reputation.  Thus , they become vulnerable to any changes in that \ntradition or culture and to any influenc es that would affect that reputation. \n   Family-centered parents do not have the emotio nal freedom, the power, to raise their children with \ntheir ultimate welfare truly in mind.  If they derive  their own security from the family, their need to be \npopular with their children may ove rride the importance of a long-ter m investment in their children's \ngrowth and development.

    "text": " these \ndeep-seated tendencies combine with the emotional dependency in the marriage, the spouse-centered \nrelationship reveals all its vulnerability.    When we are dependent on the person with wh om we are in conflict, both need and conflict are \ncompounded.  Love-hate overreactions, fight-or -flight tendencies, withdrawal, aggressiveness, \nbitterness, resentment, and cold comp etition are some of the usual results.  When these occur, we tend \nto fall even further back on background tendencies an d habits in an effort to justify and defend our own \nbehavior and we attack our spouse's.    I n e v i t a b l\ny, anytime we are too vulnerable we feel the need to protect ourselves fr om further wounds.  \nSo we resort to sarcasm, cutting humor, criticis m -- anything that will keep from exposing the \ntenderness within.  Each partner te nds to wait on the initiative of the other for love, only to be \ndisappointed but also confirmed as to the rightness of the accusations made.    There is only phantom security in such a relationship when all appears to be going well.  Guidance \nis based on the emotion of the moment.  Wisdom an d power are lost",

Or they may be focused on  the proper and correct behavior of the moment.  \nAny behavior that they consider improper threatens their security.  They become upset, guided by the \nemotions of the moment, spontaneously reacting to  the immediate concern rather than the long-term \ngrowth and development of the child.  They may ove rreact and punish out of bad temper.  They tend \nto love their children conditionally, making them  emotionally dependent or counterdependent and \nrebellious.    Money Centeredness.  Another logical and extr emely common center to people's lives is making \nmoney.  Economic security is basic to one's opport unity to do much in any other dimension.  In a \nhierarchy or continuum of needs, physical survival and financial security comes first.  Other needs are \nnot even activated until that basic need is satisfied, at least minimally.    Most of us face economic worries.  Many fo rces in the wider culture can and do act upon our \neconomic situation, causing or threatening such di sruption that we often expe rience concern and worry \nthat may not always rise to the conscious surface.    Sometimes there are apparently noble reasons give n for making money, such as the desire to take \ncare of one's family.  And these things are importan t.  But to focus on money-making as a center will \nbring about its own undoing.    Consider again the four life-support factors -- security, guidance, wisd om, and power.  Suppose I \nderive much of my security from my employment or from my income or net worth.  Since many \nfactors affect these economic foun dations, I become anxious and uneasy, protective and defensive, \nabout anything that may affect th em.  When my sense of personal worth comes from my net worth, I \nam vulnerable to anything that w ill affect that net worth.  But wo rk and money, per se, provide no \nwisdom, no guidance, and only a limited degree of power and security.

    "text": "  \nlimitations of a money center is a crisis in my life or in the life of a loved one. \n   Money-centered people often put aside fam ily or other priorities, assuming everyone will \nunderstand that economic demands come first.  I know one father who was leaving with his children \nfor a promised trip to the circus when a phone call came  for him to come to work instead.  He declined.  \nWhen his wife suggested that perh aps he should have gone to work , he responded, \"The work will \ncome again, but childhood won't.\" For the rest of th eir lives his children rememb ered this little act of \npriority setting, not only as an object lesson in their minds but as an expression of love in their hearts. \n   Work Centeredness.  Work-centered people may become \"workaholics,\" driving themselves to \nproduce at the sacrifice of health, relationships,  and other important areas of their lives.  Their \nfundamental identity comes from their work -- \"I'm a doctor,\" \"I 'm a writer,\" \"I'm an actor.\" \n   Because their identity and sens e of self-worth are wrapped up in their work, their security is \nvulnerable to anything that happens to prevent them  from continuing in it.  Their guidance is a \nfunction of the demands of the work .  Their wisdom and power come in  the limited areas of their work, \nrendering them ineffective in other areas of life.    Possession Centeredness.  A driving force of many people is possessions -- not only tangible, \nmaterial possessions such as fashionable clothes, home s, cars, boats, and jewelry, but also the intangible \npossessions of fame, glory, or social prominence.  Most of us are aware, th rough our own experience, \nhow singularly flawed such a center is, simply because it can vanish rapidly and it is influenced by so \nmany forces.    If my sense of security lies in my reputation or in  the things I have, my life will be in a constant state \nof threat and jeopardy that these po ssessions may be lost or stolen or devalued.  If I'm in the presence \nof someone of greater net worth or fame or status, I f eel inferior.  If I'm in the presence of someone of \nlesser net worth or fame or status, I feel superior.  My sense of self-worth constantly fluctuates.  I \ndon't have any sense of constancy or anchorage or persistent selfhood.  I am constantly trying to \nprotect and insure my assets, properties, securities, position, or reputation.  We have all heard stories \nof people committing suicide after lo sing their fortunes in a significan t stock decline or their fame in a \npolitical reversal.    Pleasure Centeredness.  Another common center, cl osely allied with possession s, is that of fun and \npleasure.  We live in a world where instant gratific ation is available and encouraged.  Television and \nmovies are major influences in increasing people's expectations.  They graphically portray what other \npeople have and can do in living the life of ease and \"fun.\"    But while the glitter of pleasure-centered lifestyl es is graphically portrayed, the natural result of \nsuch lifestyles -- the impact on the inner person, on productivity, on rela tionships -- is seldom \naccurately seen.    Innocent pleasures in moderation can provide relaxation for the body and mind and can foster \nfamily and other relationships.  But pleasure, per se , offers no deep, lasting satisfaction or sense of \nfulfillment.  The pleasure-centered person, too s oon bored with each succ eeding level of \"fun,\" \nconstantly cries for more and more.  So the next  new pleasure has to be bigger and better, more \nexciting, with a bigger \"high.\" A person in this state becomes almost entirely narc issistic, interpreting all \nof life in terms of the pleasure it provides to the self here and now. \n   Too many vacations that last too long, too many movies, too much TV, too much video game \nplaying -- too much undisciplined leisure time in wh ich a person continually takes the course of least \nresistance -- gradually wastes a life.  It ensures th at a person's capacities stay dormant, that talents \nremain undeveloped, that the mind  and spirit become lethargic and that the heart is unfulfilled.  \nWhere is the security, the guidance, the wisdom, an d the power? At the low en d of the continuum, in \nthe pleasure of a fleeting moment.    Malcom Muggeridge writes \"A Twentieth-Century Testimony\":    When I look back on my life nowadays, which I sometimes do, what strikes me most forcibly about \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T",

    "text": "  \nlimitations of a money center is a crisis in my life or in the life of a loved one. \n   Money-centered people often put aside fam ily or other priorities, assuming everyone will \nunderstand that economic demands come first.  I know one father who was leaving with his children \nfor a promised trip to the circus when a phone call came  for him to come to work instead.  He declined.  \nWhen his wife suggested that perh aps he should have gone to work , he responded, \"The work will \ncome again, but childhood won't.\" For the rest of th eir lives his children rememb ered this little act of \npriority setting, not only as an object lesson in their minds but as an expression of love in their hearts. \n   Work Centeredness.  Work-centered people may become \"workaholics,\" driving themselves to \nproduce at the sacrifice of health, relationships,  and other important areas of their lives.  Their \nfundamental identity comes from their work -- \"I'm a doctor,\" \"I 'm a writer,\" \"I'm an actor.\" \n   Because their identity and sens e of self-worth are wrapped up in their work, their security is \nvulnerable to anything that happens to prevent them  from continuing in it.  Their guidance is a \nfunction of the demands of the work .  Their wisdom and power come in  the limited areas of their work, \nrendering them ineffective in other areas of life.    Possession Centeredness.  A driving force of many people is possessions -- not only tangible, \nmaterial possessions such as fashionable clothes, home s, cars, boats, and jewelry, but also the intangible \npossessions of fame, glory, or social prominence.  Most of us are aware, th rough our own experience, \nhow singularly flawed such a center is, simply because it can vanish rapidly and it is influenced by so \nmany forces.    If my sense of security lies in my reputation or in  the things I have, my life will be in a constant state \nof threat and jeopardy that these po ssessions may be lost or stolen or devalued.

    "text": "  \nlimitations of a money center is a crisis in my life or in the life of a loved one. \n   Money-centered people often put aside fam ily or other priorities, assuming everyone will \nunderstand that economic demands come first.  I know one father who was leaving with his children \nfor a promised trip to the circus when a phone call came  for him to come to work instead.  He declined.  \nWhen his wife suggested that perh aps he should have gone to work , he responded, \"The work will \ncome again, but childhood won't.\" For the rest of th eir lives his children rememb ered this little act of \npriority setting, not only as an object lesson in their minds but as an expression of love in their hearts. \n   Work Centeredness.  Work-centered people may become \"workaholics,\" driving themselves to \nproduce at the sacrifice of health, relationships,  and other important areas of their lives.  Their \nfundamental identity comes from their work -- \"I'm a doctor,\" \"I 'm a writer,\" \"I'm an actor.\" \n   Because their identity and sens e of self-worth are wrapped up in their work, their security is \nvulnerable to anything",

    "text": " or fame or status, I f eel inferior.  If I'm in the presence of someone of \nlesser net worth or fame or status, I feel superior.  My sense of self-worth constantly fluctuates.  I \ndon't have any sense of constancy or anchorage or persistent selfhood.  I am constantly trying to \nprotect and insure my assets, properties, securities, position, or reputation.  We have all heard stories \nof people committing suicide after lo sing their fortunes in a significan t stock decline or their fame in a \npolitical reversal.    Pleasure Centeredness.  Another common center, cl osely allied with possession s, is that of fun and \npleasure.  We live in a world where instant gratific ation is available and encouraged.  Television and \nmovies are major influences in increasing people's expectations.  They graphically portray what other \npeople have and can do in living the life of ease and \"fun.\"    But while the glitter of pleasure-centered lifestyl es is graphically portrayed, the natural result of \nsuch lifestyles -- the impact on the inner person, on productivity, on rela tionships -- is seldom \naccurately seen.    Innocent pleasures in moderation can provide relaxation for the body and mind and can foster \nfamily and other relationships.  But pleasure, per se , offers no deep, lasting satisfaction or sense of \nfulfillment.  The pleasure-centered person, too s oon bored with each succ eeding level of \"fun,\" \nconstantly cries for more and more.  So the next  new pleasure has to be bigger and better, more \nexciting, with a bigger \"high.\" A person in this state becomes almost entirely narc issistic, interpreting all \nof life in terms of the pleasure it provides to the self here and now. \n   Too many vacations that last too long, too many movies, too much TV, too much video game \nplaying -- too much undisciplined leisure time in wh ich a person continually takes the course of least \nresistance -- gradually wastes a life.  It ensures th at a person's capacities stay dormant, that talents \nremain undeveloped, that the mind  and spirit become lethargic and that the heart is unfulfilled.  \nWhere is the security, the guidance, the wisdom, an d the power? At the low en d of the continuum, in \nthe pleasure of a fleeting moment.    Malcom Mug",

    "text": "geridge writes \"A Twentieth-Century Testimony\":    When I look back on my life nowadays, which I sometimes do, what strikes me most forcibly about \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \nit is that what seemed at the time most signific ant and seductive, seems no w most futile and absurd.  \nFor instance, success in all of its various guises; be ing known and being praised; ostensible pleasures, \nlike acquiring money or seducing women, or travelin g, going to and fro in the world and up and down \nin it like Satan, explaining and experi encing whatever Vanity Fair has to offer. \n   In retrospect, all these exercises in self-gratific ation seem pure fantasy, what Pascal called, \"licking \nthe earth.\"    Friend/Enemy Centeredness.  Young people are particularly, though certainly not exclusively, susceptible to becoming friend-centered.  Accept ance and belonging to a peer group can become \nalmost supremely important.  The distorted and ev er-changing social mirror  becomes the source for \nthe four life-support factors, creating a high degree of dependence on the fluc tuating moods, feelings, \nattitudes, and behavior of others.    Friend centeredness can also focus exclusively on  one person, taking on some of the dimensions of \nmarriage.  The emotional dependence on one indivi dual, the escalating need/conflict spiral, and the \nresulting negative interactions can grow out of friend centeredness.    And what about putting an enem y at the center of one's life? Most  people would never think of it, \nand probably no one would ever do it consciously.   Nevertheless, enemy ce ntering is very common, \nparticularly when there is frequent interaction be tween people who are in real conflict.  When \nsomeone feels he has been unjustly de alt with by an emotionally or socia lly significant person, it is very \neasy for him to become preoccupied with the injustice and make the other person the center of his life.  \nRather than proactively leading his own life, the enem y-centered person is counterdependently reacting \nto the behavior and attitudes of a perceived enemy.    One friend of mine who taught at a university became very distraught because of the weaknesses of \na particular administrator with whom he had a nega tive relationship.  He allowed himself to think \nabout the man constantly until eventually it became  a n  o b s e s s i o n .   I t  s o  p r e o c c u p i e d  h i m  t h a t  i t  \naffected the quality of his relationships with his family, his church, and his working associates.  He \nfinally came to the conclusion that he had to leav e the university and accept a teaching appointment \nsomewhere else.    \"Wouldn't you really prefer to teach at this university, if the man were not here?\" I asked him. \n   \"Yes, I would,\" he responded.  \"But as long as  he is here, then my stay ing is too disruptive to \neverything in life.  I have to go.    \"Why have you made this administrator  the center of your life?\" I asked him. \n   He was shocked by the question.  He denied it.  But I pointed out to him that he was allowing one \nindividual and his weaknesses to distort his entire ma p of life, to undermine hi s faith and the quality of \nhis relationships with his loved ones.    He finally admitted that this individual had ha d such an impact on him, but he denied that he \nhimself had made all these choices.  He attributed  the responsibility for the unhappy situation to the \nadministrator.  He, himself, he declared, was not responsible.    As we talked, little by little, he came to realiz e that he was indeed responsible, but that because he \ndid not handle this responsibility well, he was being irresponsible.    Many divorced people fall into a similar pattern.  They are still consumed with anger and bitterness \nand self-justification regarding an ex-spouse.  In  a negative sense, psychologically they are still \nmarried -- they each need the weaknesses of the former partner to justify their accusations. \n   Many \"older\" children go through life either secr etly or openly hating th eir parents.  They blame \nthem for past abuses, neglect, or favoritism and they  center their adult life on that hatred, living out the \nreactive, justifying script that accompanies it.

The distorted and ev er-changing social mirror  becomes the source for \nthe four life-support factors, creating a high degree of dependence on the fluc tuating moods, feelings, \nattitudes, and behavior of others.    Friend centeredness can also focus exclusively on  one person, taking on some of the dimensions of \nmarriage.  The emotional dependence on one indivi dual, the escalating need/conflict spiral, and the \nresulting negative interactions can grow out of friend centeredness.    And what about putting an enem y at the center of one's life? Most  people would never think of it, \nand probably no one would ever do it consciously.   Nevertheless, enemy ce ntering is very common, \nparticularly when there is frequent interaction be tween people who are in real conflict.  When \nsomeone feels he has been unjustly de alt with by an emotionally or socia lly significant person, it is very \neasy for him to become preoccupied with the injustice and make the other person the center of his life.  \nRather than proactively leading his own life, the enem y-centered person is counterdependently reacting \nto the behavior and attitudes of",

    "text": " \neasy for him to become preoccupied with the injustice and make the other person the center of his life.  \nRather than proactively leading his own life, the enem y-centered person is counterdependently reacting \nto the behavior and attitudes of a perceived enemy.    One friend of mine who taught at a university became very distraught because of the weaknesses of \na particular administrator with whom he had a nega tive relationship.  He allowed himself to think \nabout the man constantly until eventually it became  a n  o b s e s s i o n .   I t  s o  p r e o c c u p i e d  h i m  t h a t  i t  \naffected the quality of his relationships with his family, his church, and his working associates.  He \nfinally came to the conclusion that he had to leav e the university and accept a teaching appointment \nsomewhere else.    \"Wouldn't you really prefer to teach at this university, if the man were not here?\" I asked him. \n   \"Yes, I would,\" he responded.  \"But as long as  he is here, then my stay ing is too disruptive to \neverything in life.  I have to go.    \"Why have you made this administrator  the center of your life?\" I asked him. \n   He was shocked by the question.  He denied it.  But I pointed out to him that he was allowing one \nindividual and his weaknesses to distort his entire ma p of life, to undermine hi s faith and the quality of \nhis relationships with his loved ones.    He finally admitted that this individual had ha d such an impact on him, but he denied that he \nhimself had made all these choices.  He attributed  the responsibility for the unhappy situation to the \nadministrator.  He, himself, he declared, was not responsible.    As we talked, little by little, he came to realiz e that he was indeed responsible, but that because he \ndid not handle this responsibility well, he was being irresponsible.    Many divorced people fall into a similar pattern.  They are still consumed with anger and bitterness \nand self-justification regarding an ex-spouse.  In  a negative sense, psychologically they are still \nmarried -- they each need the weaknesses of the former partner to justify their accusations. \n   Many \"older\" children go through life either secr etly or openly hating th eir parents.",

I have to go.    \"Why have you made this administrator  the center of your life?\" I asked him. \n   He was shocked by the question.  He denied it.  But I pointed out to him that he was allowing one \nindividual and his weaknesses to distort his entire ma p of life, to undermine hi s faith and the quality of \nhis relationships with his loved ones.    He finally admitted that this individual had ha d such an impact on him, but he denied that he \nhimself had made all these choices.  He attributed  the responsibility for the unhappy situation to the \nadministrator.  He, himself, he declared, was not responsible.    As we talked, little by little, he came to realiz e that he was indeed responsible, but that because he \ndid not handle this responsibility well, he was being irresponsible.    Many divorced people fall into a similar pattern.  They are still consumed with anger and bitterness \nand self-justification regarding an ex-spouse.  In",

    "text": "  They blame \nthem for past abuses, neglect, or favoritism and they  center their adult life on that hatred, living out the \nreactive, justifying script that accompanies it.    The individual who is friend- or enemy-centered has no intrinsic security.  Feelings of self-worth \nare volatile, a function of the emotional state or be havior of other people.  Guidance comes from the \nperson's perception of how others will respond, and wisdom is limited  by the social lens or by an \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \nenemy-centered paranoia.  The individual has no  power.  Other people are pulling the strings. \n   Church Centeredness.  I believe that almost an yone who is seriously involved in any church will \nrecognize that churchgoing is not synonymous with personal spirituality.  There are some people who \nget so busy in church worship and projects that th ey become insensitive to the pressing human needs \nthat surround them, contradicting the very precepts they profess to believe deeply.  There are others \nwho attend church less frequently or not at all bu t whose attitudes and behavior reflect a more genuine \ncentering in the principles of the basic Judeo-Christian ethic. \n   Having participated throughout my life in or ganized church and communi ty service groups, I have \nfound that attending church does not necessarily mean  living the principles taug ht in those meetings.  \nYou can be active in a church  but inactive in its gospel. \n   In the church-centered  life, image or appearan ce can become a person's dominant consideration, \nleading to hypocrisy that undermin es personal security and intrinsic worth.  Guidance comes from a \nsocial conscience, and the church-centered person tends to label ot hers artificially in terms of \"active,\" \n\"inactive,\" \"liberal,\" \"orthodox,\" or \"conservative.\"    Because the church is a formal organization made  up of policies, programs, practices, and people, it \ncannot by itself give a person an y deep, permanent security or sense of intrinsic worth.  Living the \nprinciples taught by the church can do  this, but the organization alone cannot. \n   Nor can the church give a person a constant se nse of guidance.  Church-centered people often tend \nto live in compartments, acting and thinking and feel ing in certain ways on the Sabbath and in totally \ndifferent ways on weekdays.  Such a lack of wholen ess or unity or integrity is a further threat to \nsecurity, creating the need for incr eased labeling and self-justifying. \n   Seeing the church as an end rather than as a means to an end undermines a person's wisdom and \nsense of balance.  Although the ch urch claims to teach people about the source of power, it does not \nclaim to be that power itself.  It claims to be one vehicle through which divine power can be channeled into man's nature.    Self-Centeredness.  Perhaps the most common cent er today is the self.  The most obvious form is \nselfishness, which violates the values of most people .  But if we look closely at many of the popular \napproaches to growth and self-fulfillment, we often find self-centering at their core. \n   There is little security, guidance, wisdom, or power  in the limited center of self.  Like the Dead Sea \nin Palestine, it accepts but never gives.  It becomes stagnant.    On the other hand, paying attention to the de velopment of self in the greater perspective of \nimproving one's ability to serve, to produce, to contribute in meaningful ways, gives context for \ndramatic increase in the four life-support factors    These are some of the more common centers from  which people approach life.  It is often much \neasier to recognize the center in someone else's life than to see it in your own.  You probably know \nsomeone who puts making money ahead of everyt hing else.  You probably know someone whose \nenergy is devoted to justifying his or her position in  an ongoing negative relationship.  If you look, you \ncan sometimes see beyond behavior into the center that creates it. \n Identifying Your Center     But where do you stand? What is at the center of your own life? Sometimes that isn't easy to see \n   Perhaps the best way to identify your own center is to look closely at your life-support factors.  If you can identify with one or more of the description s below, you can trace it back to the center from \nwhich it flows, a center which may be limiting your personal",

The individual who is friend- or enemy-centered has no intrinsic security.  Feelings of self-worth \nare volatile, a function of the emotional state or be havior of other people.  Guidance comes from the \nperson's perception of how others will respond, and wisdom is limited  by the social lens or by an \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \nenemy-centered paranoia.

I believe that almost an yone who is seriously involved in any church will \nrecognize that churchgoing is not synonymous with personal spirituality.  There are some people who \nget so busy in church worship and projects that th ey become insensitive to the pressing human needs \nthat surround them, contradicting the very precepts they profess to believe deeply.  There are others \nwho attend church less frequently or not at all bu t whose attitudes and behavior reflect a more genuine \ncentering in the principles of the basic Judeo-Christian ethic. \n   Having participated throughout my life in or ganized church and communi ty service groups, I have \nfound that attending church does not necessarily mean  living the principles taug ht in those meetings.  \nYou can be active in a church  but inactive in its gospel. \n   In the church-centered  life, image or appearan ce can become a person's dominant consideration, \nleading to hypocrisy that undermin es personal security and intrinsic worth.  Guidance comes from a \nsocial conscience, and the church-centered person tends to label ot hers artificially in terms of \"active,\" \n\"inactive,\" \"liberal,\" \"orthodox,\" or \"conservative.\"    Because the church is a formal organization made  up of policies, programs, practices, and people, it \ncannot by itself give a person an y deep, permanent security or sense of intrinsic worth.  Living the \nprinciples taught by the church can do  this, but the organization alone cannot.",

    "text": "  I believe that almost an yone who is seriously involved in any church will \nrecognize that churchgoing is not synonymous with personal spirituality.  There are some people who \nget so busy in church worship and projects that th ey become insensitive to the pressing human needs \nthat surround them, contradicting the very precepts they profess to believe deeply.  There are others \nwho attend church less frequently or not at all bu t whose attitudes and behavior reflect a more genuine \ncentering in the principles of the basic Judeo-Christian ethic. \n   Having participated throughout my life in or ganized church and communi ty service groups, I have \nfound that attending church does not necessarily mean  living the principles taug ht in those meetings.  \nYou can be active in a church  but inactive in its gospel. \n   In the church-centered  life, image or appearan ce can become a person's dominant consideration, \nleading to hypocrisy that undermin es personal security and intrinsic worth.  Guidance comes from a \nsocial conscience, and the church-centered person tends to label ot hers artificially in terms of \"active,\" \n\"inactive,\" \"liberal,\" \"orthodox,\" or \"conservative.\"    Because the church is a formal organization made  up of policies",

    "text": ", programs, practices, and people, it \ncannot by itself give a person an y deep, permanent security or sense of intrinsic worth.  Living the \nprinciples taught by the church can do  this, but the organization alone cannot. \n   Nor can the church give a person a constant se nse of guidance.  Church-centered people often tend \nto live in compartments, acting and thinking and feel ing in certain ways on the Sabbath and in totally \ndifferent ways on weekdays.  Such a lack of wholen ess or unity or integrity is a further threat to \nsecurity, creating the need for incr eased labeling and self-justifying. \n   Seeing the church as an end rather than as a means to an end undermines a person's wisdom and \nsense of balance.  Although the ch urch claims to teach people about the source of power, it does not \nclaim to be that power itself.  It claims to be one vehicle through which divine power can be channeled into man's nature.    Self-Centeredness.  Perhaps the most common cent er today is the self.  The most obvious form is \nselfishness, which violates the values of most people .  But if we look closely at many of the popular \napproaches to growth and self-fulfillment, we often find self-centering at their core. \n   There is little security, guidance, wisdom, or power  in the limited center of self.  Like the Dead Sea \nin Palestine, it accepts but never gives.  It becomes stagnant.    On the other hand, paying attention to the de velopment of self in the greater perspective of \nimproving one's ability to serve, to produce, to contribute in meaningful ways, gives context for \ndramatic increase in the four life-support factors    These are some of the more common centers from  which people approach life.  It is often much \neasier to recognize the center in someone else's life than to see it in your own.  You probably know \nsomeone who puts making money ahead of everyt hing else.  You probably know someone whose \nenergy is devoted to justifying his or her position in  an ongoing negative relationship.  If you look, you \ncan sometimes see beyond behavior into the center that creates it. \n Identifying Your Center     But where do you stand? What is at the center of your own life? Sometimes that isn't easy to see \n   Perhaps the best way to identify",

    "text": " every part of your life.  A Principle Center     By centering our lives on correct principles, we cr eate a solid foundation for development of the four \nlife-support factors    Our security comes from knowing that, unlike ot her centers based on peop le or things which are \nsubject to frequent and immediate change, correct pr inciples do not change.  We can depend on them \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n   Principles don't react to anything.  They won't divorce us or run away with our best friend.  They \naren't out to get us.  They can't pa ve our way with shortcuts and quic k fixes.  They don't depend on \nthe behavior of others, the environment, or the curre nt fad for their validity.  Principles don't die.  \nThey aren't here one day and gone the next.  They can't be destroyed by fire, earthquake, or theft. \n   Principles are deep, fundamental truths, cla ssic truths, generic common denominators.  They are \ntightly interwoven threads running with exactness, co nsistency, beauty, and strength through the fabric \nof life.    Even in the midst of people or circumstances that  seem to ignore the principles, we can be secure in \nthe knowledge that principles are bigger than people or circumstances, and that thousands of years of \nhistory have seen them triumph, time and time agai n.  Even more important, we can be secure in the \nknowledge that we can validate them in our own lives, by our own experience.    Admittedly, we're not omniscient.  Our knowle dge and understanding of correct principles is \nlimited by our own lack of awareness of our true nature and the world around us and by the flood of \ntrendy philosophies and theories that are not in harmony with correct principles.  These ideas will \nhave their season of acceptance, but, like many befo re them, they won't endure  because they're built on \nfalse foundations.    We are limited, but we can push back the border s of our limitations.  An understanding of the \nprinciple of our own growth enable s us to search out correct principl es with the conf idence that the \nmore we learn, the more clearly we can focus the lens  through which we see the world.  The principles \ndon't change; our understanding of them does.    The wisdom and guidance that accompany Princi ple-Centered Living come from correct maps, from \nthe way things really are, have be en, and will be.  Correct maps enab le us to clearly see where we want \nto go and how to get there.  We can make our de cisions using the correct data that will make their \nimplementation possible and meaningful.    The personal power that comes from Principl e-Centered Living is the power of a self-aware, \nknowledgeable, proactive individual, unrestricted by the attitudes, behaviors, and actions of others or \nby many of the circumstances and environm ental influences that limit other people. \n   The only real limitation of power is the natural consequences of the principles themselves.  We are \nfree to choose our actions, based on our knowledge of correct principles, but we are not free to choose \nthe consequences of those actions.  Remember, \"If yo u pick up one end of the stick, you pick up the \nother.    Principles always have natural consequences a ttached to them.  There are positive consequences \nwhen we live in harmony with the principles.  There are negative consequences when we ignore them.  \nBut because these principles apply to everyone, wh ether or not they are aware, this limitation is \nuniversal.  And the more we know of correct princi ples, the greater is our personal freedom to act \nwisely.    By centering our lives on timeless, unchanging  principles, we create a fundamental paradigm of \neffective living.  It is the center that  puts all other centers in perspective. \n   If you are Principle Centered...    S E C U R I T Y     Your security is based on correct principles that  do not change, regardless of  external conditions or \ncircumstances.    You know that true principles can repeatedly  be validated in your own life, through your own \nexperiences.    As a measurement of self-improvement, correct principles function with exactness, consistency, \nbeauty and strength.    Correct principles help you understand your own development, endowing you with the confidence \nto learn more, thereby increasing your knowledge and understanding. \nT H E  S E V E",

They can't be destroyed by fire, earthquake, or theft. \n   Principles are deep, fundamental truths, cla ssic truths, generic common denominators.  They are \ntightly interwoven threads running with exactness, co nsistency, beauty, and strength through the fabric \nof life.    Even in the midst of people or circumstances that  seem to ignore the principles, we can be secure in \nthe knowledge that principles are bigger than people or circumstances, and that thousands of years of \nhistory have seen them triumph, time and time agai n.  Even more important, we can be secure in the \nknowledge that we can validate them in our own lives, by our own experience.    Admittedly, we're not omniscient.  Our knowle dge and understanding of correct principles is \nlimited by our own lack of awareness of our true nature and the world around us and by the flood of \ntrendy philosophies and theories that are not in harmony with correct principles.  These ideas will \nhave their season of acceptance,",

The wisdom and guidance that accompany Princi ple-Centered Living come from correct maps, from \nthe way things really are, have be en, and will be.  Correct maps enab le us to clearly see where we want \nto go and how to get there.  We can make our de cisions using the correct data that will make their \nimplementation possible and meaningful.    The personal power that comes from Principl e-Centered Living is the power of a self-aware, \nknowledgeable, proactive individual, unrestricted by the attitudes, behaviors, and actions of others or \nby many of the circumstances and environm ental influences that limit other people. \n   The only real limitation of power is the natural consequences of the principles themselves.  We are \nfree to choose our actions, based on our knowledge of correct principles, but we are not free to choose \nthe consequences of those actions.  Remember, \"If yo u pick up one end of the stick, you pick up the \nother.    Principles always have natural consequences a ttached to them.  There are positive consequences \nwhen we live in harmony with the principles.  There are negative consequences when we ignore them.  \nBut because these principles apply to everyone, wh ether or not they are aware, this limitation is \nuniversal.  And the more we know of correct princi ples, the greater is our personal freedom to act \nwisely.    By centering our lives on timeless, unchanging  principles, we create a fundamental paradigm of \neffective living.  It is the center that  puts all other centers in perspective. \n   If you are Principle Centered...    S E C U R I T Y     Your security is based on correct principles that  do not change, regardless of  external conditions or \ncircumstances.    You know that true principles can repeatedly  be validated in your own life, through your own \nexperiences.    As a measurement of self-improvement, correct principles",

An understanding of the \nprinciple of our own growth enable s us to search out correct principl es with the conf idence that the \nmore we learn, the more clearly we can focus the lens  through which we see the world.  The principles \ndon't change; our understanding of them does.    The wisdom and guidance that accompany Princi ple-Centered Living come from correct maps, from \nthe way things really are, have be en, and will be.  Correct maps enab le us to clearly see where we want \nto go and how to get there.  We can make our de cisions using the correct data that will make their \nimplementation possible and meaningful.    The personal power that comes from Principl e-Centered Living is the power of a self-aware, \nknowledgeable, proactive individual, unrestricted by the attitudes, behaviors, and actions of others or \nby many of the circumstances and environm ental influences that limit other people. \n   The only real limitation of power is the natural consequences of the principles themselves",

Correct principles help you understand your own development, endowing you with the confidence \nto learn more, thereby increasing your knowledge and understanding. \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n   Your source of security provides you with an  immovable, unchanging, unfailing core enabling you \nto see change as an exciting adventure and o pportunity to make significant contributions. \n   G U I D A N C E     You are guided by a compass which enables you to see where you want to go and how you will get \nthere.    You use accurate data which makes your decisions both implementable and meaningful. \n   You stand apart from life's situations, and circ umstances and look at the balanced whole. Your \ndecisions and actions reflect both short and long-term considerations and implications. \n   In every situation, you consciously, proactively determine the best alternative, basing decisions on \nconscience educated by principles.    W I S D O M     Your judgment encompasses a broad spectrum of long-term consequences and reflects a wise \nbalance and quiet assurance.    You see things differently and thus you think an d act differently from the largely reactive world. \n   You view the world through a fundamental  paradigm for effective, provident living. \n   You see the world in terms of what you can do for the world and its people. \n   You adopt a proactive lifestyle, seeking to serve and build others.    You interpret all of life's experiences in te rms of opportunities for learning and contribution. \n   P O W E R     Your power is limited only by your unders tanding and observance of  natural law and correct \nprinciples and by the natural conseque nces of the principles themselves. \n   You become a self-aware, knowledgeable, proactiv e individual, largely unrestricted by the attitudes, \nbehaviors, or actions of others.    Your ability to act reaches far beyond your ow n resources and encourages highly developed levels \nof interdependency.    Your decisions and actions are not driven by yo ur current financial or ci rcumstantial limitations. \nYou experience an interdependent freedom.    Remember that your paradigm is the source from which your attitudes and behaviors flow.  A \nparadigm is like a pair of glasses; it affects the wa y you see everything in your life.  If you look at \nthings through the paradigm of correct principles, wh at you see in life is dramatically different from \nwhat you see through any other centered paradigm.    I have included in the Appendix section of th is book a detailed chart wh ich shows how each center \nwe've discussed might possibly affe ct the way you see everything else.  But for a quick understanding \nof the difference your center makes, let's look at ju st one example of a specific  problem as seen through \nthe different paradigms.  As you read, try to put on each pair  of glasses.  Try to feel the response that \nflows from the different centers.    Suppose tonight you have invited your wife to go  to a concert.  You have the tickets; she's excited \nabout going.  It's four o'clock in the afternoon.    All of a sudden, your boss calls you into his o ffice and says he needs your help through the evening \nto get ready for an important meeting at 9 A.M. tomorrow.    If you're looking through spouse-centered or fa mily-centered glasses, your main concern will be \nyour wife.  You may tell the boss you can't stay and yo u take her to the concert in an effort to please \nher.  You may feel you have to stay to protect your  job, but you'll do so grudgingly, anxious about her \nresponse, trying to justify your decision and pr otect yourself from her disappointment or anger. \n   If you're looking through a money-centered lens , your main thought will be of the overtime you'll \nget or the influence working late will have on a pote ntial raise.  You may call your wife and simply tell \nher you have to stay, assuming she'll unders tand that economic demands come first. \n   If you're work-centered, you may be thinking of the opportunity.  You can learn more about the \njob.  \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \nYou can",

You use accurate data which makes your decisions both implementable and meaningful. \n   You stand apart from life's situations, and circ umstances and look at the balanced whole.

W I S D O M     Your judgment encompasses a broad spectrum of long-term consequences and reflects a wise \nbalance and quiet assurance.    You see things differently and thus you think an d act differently from the largely reactive world. \n   You view the world through a fundamental  paradigm for effective, provident living. \n   You see the world in terms of what you can do for the world and its people. \n   You adopt a proactive lifestyle, seeking to serve and build others.

Your ability to act reaches far beyond your ow n resources and encourages highly developed levels \nof interdependency.    Your decisions and actions are not driven by yo ur current financial or ci rcumstantial limitations. \nYou experience an interdependent freedom.    Remember that your paradigm",

    "text": " reaches far beyond your ow n resources and encourages highly developed levels \nof interdependency.    Your decisions and actions are not driven by yo ur current financial or ci rcumstantial limitations. \nYou experience an interdependent freedom.    Remember that your paradigm is the source from which your attitudes and behaviors flow.  A \nparadigm is like a pair of glasses; it affects the wa y you see everything in your life.  If you look at \nthings through the paradigm of correct principles, wh at you see in life is dramatically different from \nwhat you see through any other centered paradigm.    I have included in the Appendix section of th is book a detailed chart wh ich shows how each center \nwe've discussed might possibly affe ct the way you see everything else.  But for a quick understanding \nof the difference your center makes, let's look at ju st one example of a specific  problem as seen through \nthe different paradigms.  As you read, try to put on each pair  of glasses.  Try to feel the response that \nflows from the different centers.    Suppose tonight you have invited your wife to go  to a concert.  You have the tickets; she's excited \nabout going.  It's four o'clock in the afternoon.    All of a sudden, your boss calls you into his o ffice and says he needs your help through the evening \nto get ready for an important meeting at 9 A.M. tomorrow.    If you're looking through spouse-centered or fa mily-centered glasses, your main concern will be \nyour wife.  You may tell the boss you can't stay and yo u take her to the concert in an effort to please \nher.  You may feel you have to stay to protect your  job, but you'll do so grudgingly, anxious about her \nresponse, trying to justify your decision and pr otect yourself from her disappointment or anger. \n   If you're looking through a money-centered lens , your main thought will be of the overtime you'll \nget or the influence working late will have on a pote ntial raise.  You may call your wife and simply tell \nher you have to stay, assuming she'll unders tand that economic demands come first. \n   If you're work-centered, you may be thinking of the opportunity.  You can learn more about the \njob.  \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G",

You have the tickets; she's excited \nabout going.  It's four o'clock in the afternoon.    All of a sudden, your boss calls you into his o ffice and says he needs your help through the evening \nto get ready for an important meeting at 9 A.M. tomorrow.    If you're looking through spouse-centered or fa mily-centered glasses, your main concern will be \nyour wife.  You may tell the boss you can't stay and yo u take her to the concert in an effort to please \nher.  You may feel you have to stay to protect your  job, but you'll do so grudgingly, anxious about her \nresponse, trying to justify your decision and pr otect yourself from her disappointment or anger. \n   If you're looking through a money-centered lens , your main thought will be of the overtime you'll \nget or the influence working late will have on a pote ntial raise.  You may call your wife and simply tell \nher you have to stay, assuming she'll unders tand that economic demands come first.",

You may give yourself a pat on the \nback for putting hours well beyond what is required, evidence of what a hard worker you are.  Your wife should be proud of you!    If you're possession-centered, you might be thinki ng of the things the overtime income could buy.  \nOr you might consider what an asset to your reputa tion at the office it would be if you stayed.  \nEveryone would hear tomorrow how noble, how sacrificing and dedicated you are. \n   If you're pleasure-centered, you'll probably can th e work and go to the conc ert, even if your wife \nwould be happy for you to work late.  You deserve a night out!    If you're friend-centered, your decision woul d be influenced by whether or not you had invited \nfriends to attend the concert with you.  Or whether your friends at work were going to stay late, too.    If you're enemy-centered, you may stay late beca use you know it will give you a big edge over that \nperson in the office who thinks he 's the company's greatest asset.  While he's off having fun, you'll be \nworking and slaving, doing his work and yours, sacrificing your person al pleasure for the good of the \ncompany he can so blithely ignore.    If you're church-centered, you might be influenc ed by plans other church members have to attend \nthe concert, by whether or not any church members work at your office, or by the nature of the concert \n-- Handel's Messiah might rate higher in priority than  a rock concert.  Your decision might also be \naffected by what you think a \"goo d church member\" would do and by  whether you view the extra work \nas \"service\" or \"seeking after material wealth.\"    If you're self-centered, you'll be focused on what  will do you the most good.  Would it be better for \nyou to go out for the evening? Or would it be be tter for you to make a few points with the boss? How \nthe different options affect you will be your main concern.    As we consider various ways of looking at a si ngle event, is it any wonder that we have \"young \nlady/old lady\" perception problems in our in teractions with each other? Can you see how \nfundamentally our centers affect us? Right down to our motivations, our daily decisions, our actions (or, \nin too many cases, our reactions), our interpretati ons of events? That's wh y understanding your own \ncenter is so important.  And if that center does  not empower you as a proactive person, it becomes \nfundamental to your effectiveness to make the necessa ry Paradigm Shifts to create a center that will. \n   As a principle-centered person, you try to stan d apart from the emotion of the situation and from \nother factors that would act on you, and evaluate the option.  Looking at the balanced whole -- the \nwork needs, the family needs, ot her needs that may be involved an d the possible implications of the \nvarious alternative decisions -- you'll try to come up  with the best solution, taking all factors into \nconsideration.    Whether you go to the concert or stay and work is  really a small part of an effective decision.  You \nmight make the same choice with a number of other centers.  But there are several important \ndifferences when you are coming from a principle-ce ntered paradigm.  First, you are not being acted \nupon by other people or circumstances.  You are proactively choosing what you determine to be the \nbest alternative.  You make your de cisions consciously and knowledgeably. \n   Second, you know your decision is most effectiv e because it is based on pr inciples with predictable \nlong-term results.    Third, what you choose to do contributes to your ultimate values in life.  Staying at work to get the \nedge on someone at the office is an entirely diffe rent evening in your life from staying because you \nvalue your boss's effectiveness and you genuinely wa nt to contribute to the company's welfare.  The \nexperiences you have as you carry out your decision s take on quality and meaning in the context of \nyour life as a whole.    Fourth, you can communicate to your wife and your boss within strong networks you've created in \nyour interdependent relationships.  Because you are independent, you can be effectively \ninterdependent.  You might decide to delegate what  is delegable and come in early the next morning \nT H E  S E V E",

You may give yourself a pat on the \nback for putting hours well beyond what is required, evidence of what a hard worker you are.  Your wife should be proud of you!    If you're possession-centered, you might be thinki ng of the things the overtime income could buy.  \nOr you might consider what an asset to your reputa tion at the office it would be if you stayed.  \nEveryone would hear tomorrow how noble, how sacrificing and dedicated you are. \n   If you're pleasure-centered, you'll probably can th e work and go to the conc ert, even if your wife \nwould be happy for you to work late.  You deserve a night out!    If you're friend-centered, your decision woul d be influenced by whether or not you had invited \nfriends to attend the concert with you.

Or whether your friends at work were going to stay late, too.    If you're enemy-centered, you may stay late beca use you know it will give you a big edge over that \nperson in the office who thinks he 's the company's greatest asset.  While he's off having fun, you'll be \nworking and slaving, doing his work and yours, sacrificing your person al pleasure for the good of the \ncompany he can so blithely ignore.    If you're church-centered, you might be influenc ed by plans other church members have to attend \nthe concert, by whether or not any church members work at your office, or by the nature of the concert \n-- Handel's Messiah might rate higher in priority than  a rock concert.  Your decision might also be \naffected by what you think a \"goo d church member\" would do and by  whether you view the extra work \nas \"service\" or \"seeking after material wealth.\"    If you're self-centered, you'll be focused on what  will do you the most good.

As we consider various ways of looking at a si ngle event, is it any wonder that we have \"young \nlady/old lady\" perception problems in our in teractions with each other? Can you see how \nfundamentally our centers affect us? Right down to our motivations, our daily decisions, our actions (or, \nin too many cases, our reactions), our interpretati ons of events? That's wh y understanding your own \ncenter is so important.  And if that center does  not empower you as a proactive person, it becomes \nfundamental to your effectiveness to make the necessa ry Paradigm Shifts to create a center that will. \n   As a principle-centered person, you try to stan d apart from the emotion of the situation and from \nother factors that would act on you, and evaluate the option.  Looking at the balanced whole -- the \nwork needs, the family needs, ot her needs that may be involved an d the possible implications of the \nvarious alternative decisions -- you'll try to come up  with the best solution, taking all factors into \nconsideration.    Whether you go to the concert or stay and work is  really a small part of an effective decision.  You \nmight make the same choice with a number of other centers.  But there are several important \ndifferences when you are coming from a principle-ce ntered paradigm.  First, you are not being acted \nupon by other people or circumstances.  You are proactively choosing what you determine to be the \nbest alternative.  You make your de cisions consciously and knowledgeably. \n   Second, you know your decision is most effectiv e because it is based on pr inciples with predictable \nlong-term results.    Third, what you choose to do contributes to your ultimate values in life.  Staying at work to get the \nedge on someone at the office is an entirely diffe rent evening in your life from staying because you \nvalue your boss's effectiveness and you genuinely wa nt to contribute to the company's welfare.  The \nexperiences you have as you carry out your decision s take on quality and meaning in the context of \nyour life as a whole.

You might decide to delegate what  is delegable and come in early the next morning \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \nto do the rest. \n   And finally, you'll feel comfortable about your decision.  Whatever you ch oose to do, you can focus \non it and enjoy it.    As a principle-centered person, you see things differently.  And because you see things differently, \nyou think differently, you act differently.  Becaus e you have a high degree of security, guidance, \nwisdom, and power that flows from a solid, unchanging core, you ha ve the foundation of a highly \nproactive and highly effective life.  Writing and Using a A Personal Mission Statement     As we go deeply within oursel ves, as we understand and realign our basic paradigms to bring them \nin harmony with correct principles, we create both an effective, empowering center and a clear lens \nthrough which we can see the world.  We can then fo cus that lens on how we, as unique individuals, \nrelate to that world    Frankl says we detect rather than  invent our missions in life.  I lik e that choice of words.  I think \neach of us has an internal monitor or sense, a conscience, that gives us an awareness of our own \nuniqueness and the singular contri butions that we can make.  In F rankl's words, \"Everyone has his \nown specific vocation or mission in life.  Therein he cannot be replaced, nor can his life be repeated.  \nThus, everyone's task is as unique as is  his specific opportunity to implement it. \n   In seeking to give verbal expression to that  uniqueness, we are again reminded of the fundamental \nimportance of proactivity and of working within ou r Circle of Influence.  To seek some abstract \nmeaning to our lives out in our Circle of Concern is to abdicate our proactive responsibility, to place our \nown first creation in the hands of circumstance and other people.    Our meaning comes from within.  Again, in th e words of Frankl, \"Ultimately, man should not ask \nwhat the meaning of his life is, but rather must recognize that it is he  who is asked.  In a word, each \nman is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for hi s own life; to life he can \nonly respond by being responsible.\"    Personal responsibility, or proactivity, is fun damental to the first crea tion.  Returning to the \ncomputer metaphor, Habit 1 says \"You are the prog rammer.\" Habit 2, then, says , \"Write the program.\" \nUntil you accept the idea that you are responsible, that you are the programmer, you won't really invest \nin writing the program.    As proactive people , we can begin to give expression to what we want to be and to do in our lives.  We can write a personal mission st atement, a personal constitution. \n   A mission statement is not so mething you write overnight.  It takes deep introspection, careful \nanalysis, thoughtful expression, and often many rewrit es to produce it in final form.  It may take you \nseveral weeks or even months before you feel really co mfortable with it, before you feel it is a complete \nand concise expression of your innermost values and directions.  Even then, you will want to review it \nregularly and make minor changes as the years bring additional insights or changing circumstances. \n   But fundamentally, your mission statement become s your constitution, the solid expression of your \nvision and values.  It becomes the criterion by which you measure everything else in your life. \n   I recently finished reviewing my own mission stat ement, which I do fairly regularly.  Sitting on the \nedge of a beach, alone, at the end of a bicycle ride, I took out my organizer and hammered it out.  It took several hours, but I felt a sense of clarity, a sense of organization and commitment, a sense of \nexhilaration and freedom.    I find the process is as important as the produc t.  Writing or reviewing a mission statement changes \nyou because it forces you to think through your prio rities deeply, carefully, an d to align your behavior \nwith your beliefs.  As you do, other people begin to sense that you're not being driven by everything that happens to you.  You have a sense of mission about what you're trying",

Writing and Using a A Personal Mission Statement     As we go deeply within oursel ves, as we understand and realign our basic paradigms to bring them \nin harmony with correct principles, we create both an effective, empowering center and a clear lens \nthrough which we can see the world.  We can then fo cus that lens on how we, as unique individuals, \nrelate to that world    Frankl says we detect rather than  invent our missions in life.  I lik e that choice of words.  I think \neach of us has an internal monitor or sense, a conscience, that gives us an awareness of our own \nuniqueness and the singular contri butions that we can make.  In F rankl's words, \"Everyone has his \nown specific vocation or mission in life.  Therein he cannot be replaced, nor can his life be repeated.  \nThus, everyone's task is as unique as is  his specific opportunity to implement it. \n   In seeking to give verbal expression to that  uniqueness, we are again reminded of the fundamental \nimportance of proactivity and of working within ou r Circle of Influence.  To seek some abstract \nmeaning to our lives out in our Circle of Concern is to abdicate our proactive responsibility, to place our \nown first creation in the hands of circumstance and other people.

    "text": " of Influence.  To seek some abstract \nmeaning to our lives out in our Circle of Concern is to abdicate our proactive responsibility, to place our \nown first creation in the hands of circumstance and other people.    Our meaning comes from within.  Again, in th e words of Frankl, \"Ultimately, man should not ask \nwhat the meaning of his life is, but rather must recognize that it is he  who is asked.  In a word, each \nman is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for hi s own life; to life he can \nonly respond by being responsible.\"    Personal responsibility, or proactivity, is fun damental to the first crea tion.  Returning to the \ncomputer metaphor, Habit 1 says \"You are the prog rammer.\" Habit 2, then, says , \"Write the program.\" \nUntil you accept the idea that you are responsible, that you are the programmer, you won't really invest \nin writing the program.    As proactive people , we can begin to give expression to what we want to be and to do in our lives.  We can write a personal mission st atement, a personal constitution. \n   A mission statement is not so mething you write overnight.  It takes deep introspection, careful \nanalysis, thoughtful expression, and often many rewrit es to produce it in final form.  It may take you \nseveral weeks or even months before you feel really co mfortable with it, before you feel it is a complete \nand concise expression of your innermost values and directions.  Even then, you will want to review it \nregularly and make minor changes as the years bring additional insights or changing circumstances. \n   But fundamentally, your mission statement become s your constitution, the solid expression of your \nvision and values.  It becomes the criterion by which you measure everything else in your life. \n   I recently finished reviewing my own mission stat ement, which I do fairly regularly.  Sitting on the \nedge of a beach, alone, at the end of a bicycle ride, I took out my organizer and hammered it out.  It took several hours, but I felt a sense of clarity, a sense of organization and commitment, a sense of \nexhilaration and freedom.    I find the process is as important as the produc t.  Writing or reviewing a mission statement changes \nyou because it forces you to think through your prio rities",

To seek some abstract \nmeaning to our lives out in our Circle of Concern is to abdicate our proactive responsibility, to place our \nown first creation in the hands of circumstance and other people.    Our meaning comes from within.  Again, in th e words of Frankl, \"Ultimately, man should not ask \nwhat the meaning of his life is, but rather must recognize that it is he  who is asked.  In a word, each \nman is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for hi s own life; to life he can \nonly respond by being responsible.\"    Personal responsibility, or proactivity, is fun damental to the first crea tion.  Returning to the \ncomputer metaphor, Habit 1 says \"You are the prog rammer.\" Habit 2, then, says , \"Write the program.\" \nUntil you accept the idea that you are responsible, that you are the programmer, you won't really invest \nin writing the program.    As proactive people , we can begin to give expression to what we want to be and to do in our lives.  We can write a personal mission st atement, a personal constitution. \n   A mission statement is not so",

You have a sense of mission about what you're trying to do and you are excited \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \nabout it. \n  Using Your Whole Brain     Our self-awareness empowers us to examine ou r own thoughts.  This is particularly helpful in \ncreating a personal mission statement because the two unique human endowments that enable us to \npractice Habit 2 -- imagination and conscience -- are pr imarily functions of the right side of the brain.  \nUnderstanding how to tap into that right brain capa city greatly increases our first-creation ability. \n   A great deal of research has been conducted for decades on what has come to be called brain \ndominance theory.  The findings basically indicated th at each hemisphere of the brain -- left and right \n-- tends to specialize in and preside over different fun ctions, process different kinds of information, and \ndeal with different kinds of problems.    Essentially, the left hemisphere is the more logical/verbal one and the right hemisphere the more \nintuitive, creative one.  The left deals with word s, the right with pictures; the left with parts and \nspecifics, the right with wholes and the relationship  between the parts.  The left deals with analysis, \nwhich means to break apart; the right with synthesis, which means to pu t together.  The left deals with \nsequential thinking; the right with simultaneous and holistic thinking.  The left is time bound; the right \nis time free.    Although people use both sides of the brain, one side or the other generally tends to be dominant in \neach individual.  Of course, the ideal would be to cultivate and develop the ability to have good \ncrossover between both sides of the brain so that a person could first sense wh at the situation called for \nand then use the appropriate tool to deal with it.  Bu t people tend to stay in the \"comfort zone\" of their \ndominant hemisphere and process every situation accord ing to either a right- or left-brain preference. \n   In the words of Abraham Masl ow, \"He that is good with a hamme r tends to think everything is a \nnail.\" This is another factor that affects the \"young  lady/old lady\" perception difference.  Right-brain \nand left-brain people tend to look  at things in different ways. \n   We live in a primarily left-brain-dominant world, where words and measurement and logic are \nenthroned, and the more creative, intuitive, sensing, ar tistic aspect of our nature is often subordinated.  \nMany of us find it more difficult to tap into our right-brain capacity.    Admittedly this description is oversimplified and new studies will undoubtedly throw more light \non brain functioning.  But the point here is that we are capable of performing many different kinds of \nthought processes and we barely tap ou r potential.  As we become aware of its different capacities, we \ncan consciously use our minds to meet sp ecific needs in more effective ways. \n Two Ways to Tap the Right Brain     If we use the brain dominance theory as a model,  it becomes evident that the quality of our first \ncreation is significantly impacted by our ability to use our creative right brain.  The more we are able \nto draw upon our right-brain capacity, the more fully  we will be able to visua lize, to synthesize, to \ntranscend time and present circumstances, to project a holistic picture of what we want to do and to be \nin life.  Expand Perspective     Sometimes we are knocked out of our left-brain environment and thought pa tterns and into the right \nbrain by an unplanned experience.  The death of a lo ved one, a severe illness, a financial setback, or \nextreme adversity can cause us to stand back, look at  our lives, and ask ourselves some hard questions: \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n\"What's really important? Why am I doing what I'm doing? \n   But if you're proactive, you don't have to wa it for circumstances or other people to create \nperspective",

The findings basically indicated th at each hemisphere of the brain -- left and right \n-- tends to specialize in and preside over different fun ctions, process different kinds of information, and \ndeal with different kinds of problems.    Essentially, the left hemisphere is the more logical/verbal one and the right hemisphere the more \nintuitive, creative one.  The left deals with word s, the right with pictures; the left with parts and \nspecifics, the right with wholes and the relationship  between the parts.  The left deals with analysis, \nwhich means to break apart; the right with synthesis, which means to pu t together.  The left deals with \nsequential thinking; the right with simultaneous and holistic thinking.  The left is time bound; the right \nis time free.    Although people use both sides of the brain, one side or the other generally tends to be dominant in \neach individual.  Of course, the ideal would be to cultivate and develop the ability to have good \ncrossover between both sides of the brain so that a person could first sense wh at the situation called for \nand then use the appropriate tool to deal with it.

Bu t people tend to stay in the \"comfort zone\" of their \ndominant hemisphere and process every situation accord ing to either a right- or left-brain preference. \n   In the words of Abraham Masl ow, \"He that is good with a hamme r tends to think everything is a \nnail.\" This is another factor that affects the \"young  lady/old lady\" perception difference.  Right-brain \nand left-brain people tend to look  at things in different ways. \n   We live in a primarily left-brain-dominant world, where words and measurement and logic are \nenthroned, and the more creative, intuitive, sensing, ar tistic aspect of our nature is often subordinated.  \nMany of us find it more difficult to tap into our right-brain capacity.    Admittedly this description is oversimplified and new studies will undoubtedly throw more light \non brain functioning.  But the point here is that we are capable of performing many different kinds of \nthought processes and we barely tap ou r potential.  As we become aware of its different capacities, we \ncan consciously use our minds to meet sp ecific needs in more effective ways. \n Two Ways to Tap the Right Brain     If we use the brain dominance theory as a model,  it becomes evident that the quality of our first \ncreation is significantly impacted by our ability to use our creative right brain.  The more we are able \nto draw upon our right-brain capacity, the more fully  we will be able to visua lize, to synthesize, to \ntranscend time and present circumstances, to project a holistic picture of what we want to do and to be \nin life.  Expand Perspective     Sometimes we are knocked out of our left-brain environment and thought pa tterns and into the right \nbrain by an unplanned experience.  The death of a lo ved one, a severe illness, a financial setback, or \nextreme adversity can cause us to stand back, look at  our lives, and ask ourselves some hard questions: \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b",

Expand Perspective     Sometimes we are knocked out of our left-brain environment and thought pa tterns and into the right \nbrain by an unplanned experience.

Why am I doing what I'm doing? \n   But if you're proactive, you don't have to wa it for circumstances or other people to create \nperspective-expanding experiences.  You can consciously create your own.    There are a number of ways to do this.  Thro ugh the powers of your imagination, you can visualize \nyour own funeral, as we did at the beginning of this  chapter.  Write your own eulogy.  Actually write \nit out.  Be specific.    You can visualize your twenty-fifth and then your  fiftieth wedding anniversary.  Have your spouse \nvisualize this with you.  Try to capture the essence of the family relationship you want to have created \nthrough your day-by-day investment over a period of that many years. \n   You can visualize your retirement from your  present occupation.  What contributions, what \nachievements will you want to have made in your field? What plans will you have after retirement? \nWill you enter a second career?    Expand your mind.  Visualize in rich detail.  Involve as many emotions an d feelings as possible.  \nInvolve as many of the senses as you can.    I have done similar visualization exercises with  some of my university classes.  \"Assume you only \nhave this one semester to live,\" I tell my students, \"a n d  t h a t  d u r i n g  t h i s  s e m e s t e r  y o u  a r e  t o  s t a y  i n  \nschool as a good student.  Visualiz e how you would spend your semester. \n   Things are suddenly placed in a different perspe ctive.  Values quickly surface that before weren't \neven recognized.    I have also asked students to live with that expanded perspective for a week and keep a diary of \ntheir experiences.    The results are very revealing.  They start writ ing to parents to tell them how much they love and \nappreciate them.  They reconcile with a brothe r, a sister, a friend where the relationship has \ndeteriorated.    The dominant, central theme of their activities, the underlying principle, is love.  The futility of \nbad-mouthing, bad thinking, put-downs, and accusa tion becomes very evident when they think in \nterms of having only a short time to live.  Princi ples and values become more evident to everybody. \n   There are a number of techniques using your imagination that can put you in touch with your \nvalues.  But the net effect of every one I have ever used is the same.  When people seriously \nundertake to identify what really matters most to them in their lives, what they really want to be and to \ndo, they become very reverent.  They start to think in larger terms than today and tomorrow. \n Visualization and Affirmation     Personal leadership is not a singular experience .  It doesn't begin and end with the writing of a \npersonal mission statement. It is, rather, the ongoing process of keeping your vision and values before \nyou and aligning your life to be congruent with thos e most important things.  And in that effort, your \npowerful right-brain capacity can be a great help to yo u on a daily basis as you work to integrate your \npersonal mission statement into your life.  It's an other application of \"Begin  with the End in Mind.\" \n   Let's go back to an example we mentioned before .  Suppose I am a parent who really deeply loves \nm y  c h i l d r e n .   S u p p o s e  I  i d e n t i f y  t h a t  a s  o n e  o f  m y  f u n d a m e n t a l  v a l u e s  i n  m y  p e r s o n a l  m i s s i o n  statement.  But suppose, on a daily basis, I have trouble overreacting.    I can use my right-brain power of visualization to write an \"affirmation\" that will help me become \nmore congruent with my deeper values in my daily life.    A good affirmation has five basic ingredients: it's personal, it's positive, it's present tense, it's visual, \nand it's emotional.  So I might write something like  this: \"It is deeply sati sfying (emotional) that I \n(personal) respond (present tense) with wisdom, lo ve, firmness, and self-control (positive) when my \nchildren misbehave.\" \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S",

Why am I doing what I'm doing? \n   But if you're proactive, you don't have to wa it for circumstances or other people to create \nperspective-expanding experiences.  You can consciously create your own.    There are a number of ways to do this.  Thro ugh the powers of your imagination, you can visualize \nyour own funeral, as we did at the beginning of this  chapter.  Write your own eulogy.  Actually write \nit out.  Be specific.    You can visualize your twenty-fifth and then your  fiftieth wedding anniversary.  Have your spouse \nvisualize this with you.  Try to capture the essence of the family relationship you want to have created \nthrough your day-by-day investment over a period of that many years. \n   You can visualize your retirement from your  present occupation.  What contributions, what \nachievements will you want to have made in your field? What plans will you have after retirement? \nWill you enter a second career?    Expand your mind.  Visualize in rich detail.  Involve as many emotions an d feelings as possible.  \nInvolve as many of the senses as you can.    I have done similar visualization exercises with  some of my university classes.  \"Assume you only \nhave this one semester to live,\" I tell my students, \"a n d  t h a t  d u r i n g  t h i s  s e m e s t e r  y o u  a r e  t o  s t a y  i n  \nschool as a good student.  Visualiz e how you would spend your semester. \n   Things are suddenly placed in a different perspe ctive.  Values quickly surface that before weren't \neven recognized.    I have also asked students to live with that expanded perspective for a week and keep a diary of \ntheir experiences.    The results are very revealing.  They start writ ing to parents to tell them how much they love and \nappreciate them.  They reconcile with a brothe r, a sister, a friend where the relationship has \ndeteriorated.    The dominant, central theme of their activities, the underlying principle, is love.  The futility of \nbad-mouthing, bad thinking, put-downs, and accusa tion becomes very evident when they",

Why am I doing what I'm doing? \n   But if you're proactive, you don't have to wa it for circumstances or other people to create \nperspective-expanding experiences.  You can consciously create your own.    There are a number of ways to do this.  Thro ugh the powers of your imagination, you can visualize \nyour own funeral, as we did at the beginning of this  chapter.  Write your own eulogy.  Actually write \nit out.  Be specific.    You can visualize your twenty-fifth and then your  fiftieth wedding anniversary.  Have your spouse \nvisualize this with you.  Try to capture the essence of the family relationship you want to have created \nthrough your day-by-day investment over a period of that many years. \n   You can visualize your retirement from your  present occupation.  What contributions, what \nachievements will you want to have made in your field? What plans will you have after retirement? \nWill you enter a second career?    Expand your mind.  Visualize in rich detail.  Involve as many emotions an d feelings as possible.  \nInvolve",

The futility of \nbad-mouthing, bad thinking, put-downs, and accusa tion becomes very evident when they think in \nterms of having only a short time to live.  Princi ples and values become more evident to everybody. \n   There are a number of techniques using your imagination that can put you in touch with your \nvalues.  But the net effect of every one I have ever used is the same.  When people seriously \nundertake to identify what really matters most to them in their lives, what they really want to be and to \ndo, they become very reverent.  They start to think in larger terms than today and tomorrow. \n Visualization and Affirmation     Personal leadership is not a singular experience .  It doesn't begin and end with the writing of a \npersonal mission statement. It is, rather, the ongoing process of keeping your vision and values before \nyou and aligning your life to be congruent with thos e most important things.  And in that effort, your \npowerful right-brain capacity can be a great help to yo u on a daily basis as you work to integrate your \npersonal mission statement into your life.  It's an other application of \"Begin  with the End in Mind.\" \n   Let's go back to an example we mentioned before .  Suppose I am a parent who really deeply loves \nm y  c h i l d r e n .

But suppose, on a daily basis, I have trouble overreacting.    I can use my right-brain power of visualization to write an \"affirmation\" that will help me become \nmore congruent with my deeper values in my daily life.    A good affirmation has five basic ingredients: it's personal, it's positive, it's present tense, it's visual, \nand it's emotional.  So I might write something like  this: \"It is deeply sati sfying (emotional) that",

The futility of \nbad-mouthing, bad thinking, put-downs, and accusa tion becomes very evident when they think in \nterms of having only a short time to live.  Princi ples and values become more evident to everybody. \n   There are a number of techniques using your imagination that can put you in touch with your \nvalues.  But the net effect of every one I have ever used is the same.  When people seriously \nundertake to identify what really matters most to them in their lives, what they really want to be and to \ndo, they become very reverent.  They start to think in larger terms than today and tomorrow. \n Visualization and Affirmation     Personal leadership is not a singular experience .  It doesn't begin and end with the writing of a \npersonal mission statement. It is, rather, the ongoing process of keeping your vision and values before \nyou and aligning your life to be congruent with thos e most important things.  And in that effort, your \npowerful right-brain capacity can be a great help to yo u on a daily basis",

I can spend a few minu tes each day and totally relax my mind and body.  I \ncan think about situations in which my children might misbehave.  I can visualize them in rich detail.  I can feel the texture of the chair I might be sitting on, the floor under my feet , the sweater I'm wearing.  \nI can see the dress my daughter has on, the expression  on her face.  The more clearly and vividly I can \nimagine the detail, the more deeply I will experi ence it, the less I will see it as a spectator. \n   Then I can see her do something very specif ic which normally makes my heart pound and my \ntemper start to flare.  But instead of seeing my no rmal response, I can see myself handle the situation \nwith all the love, the power, the self-control I have  c a p t u r e d  i n  m y  a f f i r m a t i o n .   I  c a n  w r i t e  t h e  \nprogram, write the script, in ha rmony with my values, with my  personal mission statement. \n   And if I do this, day after day my behavior will change.  Instead of living out of the scripts given to \nme by my own parents or by society or by genetics or my environment, I will be living out of the script I \nhave written from my own self-selected value system.    I have helped and encouraged my son, Sean, to  use this affirmation process extensively throughout \nhis football career.  We started when he played qu arterback in high school, and eventually, I taught \nhim how to do it on his own.    We would try to get him in a very relaxed st ate of mind through deep breathing and progressive \nmuscle relaxation technique so that he became very  quiet inside.  Then I would help him visualize \nhimself right in the heat of the toughest situations imaginable. \n   He would imagine a big blitz coming at him fa st.  He had to read the blitz and respond.  He \nwould imagine giving audibles at the line after read ing defenses.  He would imagine quick reads with \nhis first receiver, his second receiver, his third rece iver.  He would imagine options that he normally \nwouldn't do.    At one point in his football career, he told me he was constantly getting uptight.  As we talked, I \nrealized that he was visualizing uptightness.  So we worked on visualizing relaxation in the middle of \nthe big pressure circumstance.  We discovered that th e nature of the visualizat ion is very important.  \nIf you visualize the wrong thing, you'll produce the wrong thing.    Dr. Charles Garfield has done extensive researc h on peak performers, both in athletics and in \nbusiness.  He became fascinated with peak pe rformance in his work with the NASA program, \nwatching the astronauts rehearse everything on e arth again and again in a simulated environment \nbefore they went to space.  Although he had a doctor ate in mathematics, he decided to go back and get \nanother Ph.D. in the field of psychology and study the characteristics of peak performers. \n   One of the main things his research showed was th at almost all of the worl d-class athletes and other \npeak performers are visualizers.  They see it; they feel  it; they experience it before they actually do it.  \nThey Begin with the End in Mind.    You can do it in every area of your life.  Be fore a performance, a sales presentation, a difficult \nconfrontation, or the daily challenge of meeting a goal, see it clearly, vividly, re lentlessly, over and over \nagain.  Create an internal \"comfort zone.\" Then, when  you get into the situation, it isn't foreign.  It \ndoesn't scare you.    Your creative, visual right brain is one of your most important assets, both in creating your personal \nmission statement and in integrating it into your life.    There is an entire body of literature and audi o and video tapes that deals with this process of \nvisualization and affirmation.  Some of the more rece nt developments in this field include such things \nas subliminal programming, neurolinguistic program ming",

I can spend a few minu tes each day and totally relax my mind and body.  I \ncan think about situations in which my children might misbehave.  I can visualize them in rich detail.  I can feel the texture of the chair I might be sitting on, the floor under my feet , the sweater I'm wearing.  \nI can see the dress my daughter has on, the expression  on her face.  The more clearly and vividly I can \nimagine the detail, the more deeply I will experi ence it, the less I will see it as a spectator. \n   Then I can see her do something very specif ic which normally makes my heart pound and my \ntemper start to flare.  But instead of seeing my no rmal response, I can see myself handle the situation \nwith all the love, the power, the self-control I have  c a p t u r e d  i n  m y  a f f i r m a t i o n .   I  c a n  w r i t e  t h e  \nprogram, write the script, in ha rmony with my values, with my  personal mission statement. \n   And if I do this, day after day my behavior will change.  Instead of living out of the scripts given to \nme by my own parents or by society or by genetics or my environment, I will be living out of the script I \nhave written from my own self-selected value system.    I have helped and encouraged my son, Sean, to  use this affirmation process extensively throughout \nhis football career.  We started when he played qu arterback in high school, and eventually, I taught \nhim how to do it on his own.    We would try to get him in a very relaxed st ate of mind through deep breathing and progressive \nmuscle relaxation technique so that he became very  quiet inside.  Then",

    "text": " eventually, I taught \nhim how to do it on his own.    We would try to get him in a very relaxed st ate of mind through deep breathing and progressive \nmuscle relaxation technique so that he became very  quiet inside.  Then I would help him visualize \nhimself right in the heat of the toughest situations imaginable. \n   He would imagine a big blitz coming at him fa st.  He had to read the blitz and respond.  He \nwould imagine giving audibles at the line after read ing defenses.  He would imagine quick reads with \nhis first receiver, his second receiver, his third rece iver.  He would imagine options that he normally \nwouldn't do.    At one point in his football career, he told me he was constantly getting uptight.  As we talked, I \nrealized that he was visualizing uptightness.  So we worked on visualizing relaxation in the middle of \nthe big pressure circumstance.  We discovered that th e nature of the visualizat ion is very important.  \nIf you visualize the wrong thing, you'll produce the wrong thing.    Dr. Charles Garfield has done extensive researc h on peak performers, both in athletics and in \nbusiness.  He became fascinated with peak pe rformance in his work with the NASA program, \nwatching the astronauts rehearse everything on e arth again and again in a simulated environment \nbefore they went to space.  Although he had a doctor ate in mathematics, he decided to go back and get \nanother Ph.D. in the field of psychology and study the characteristics of peak performers. \n   One of the main things his research showed was th at almost all of the worl d-class athletes and other \npeak performers are visualizers.  They see it; they feel  it; they experience it before they actually do it.  \nThey Begin with the End in Mind.    You can do it in every area of your life.  Be fore a performance, a sales presentation, a difficult \nconfrontation, or the daily challenge of meeting a goal, see it clearly, vividly, re lentlessly, over and over \nagain.  Create an internal \"comfort zone.\" Then, when  you get into the situation, it isn't foreign.  It \ndoesn't scare you.    Your creative, visual right brain is one of your most important assets, both in creating your personal \nmission statement and in integrating it into your life.    There",

    "text": " eventually, I taught \nhim how to do it on his own.    We would try to get him in a very relaxed st ate of mind through deep breathing and progressive \nmuscle relaxation technique so that he became very  quiet inside.  Then I would help him visualize \nhimself right in the heat of the toughest situations imaginable. \n   He would imagine a big blitz coming at him fa st.  He had to read the blitz and respond.  He \nwould imagine giving audibles at the line after read ing defenses.  He would imagine quick reads with \nhis first receiver, his second receiver, his third rece iver.  He would imagine options that he normally \nwouldn't do.    At one point in his football career, he told me he was constantly getting uptight.  As we talked, I \nrealized that he was visualizing uptightness.  So we worked on visualizing relaxation in the middle of \nthe big pressure circumstance.  We discovered that th e nature of the visualizat ion is very important.  \nIf you visualize the wrong thing, you'll produce the wrong thing.

    "text": " is an entire body of literature and audi o and video tapes that deals with this process of \nvisualization and affirmation.  Some of the more rece nt developments in this field include such things \nas subliminal programming, neurolinguistic program ming, and new forms of relaxation and self-talk \nprocesses.  These all involve explanation, elabo ration, and different packaging of the fundamental \nprinciples of the first creation.    My review of the success literature brought me in contact with hundreds of books on this subject.  \nAlthough some made extravagant claims and relied on  anecdotal rather than sci entific evidence, I think \nthat most of the material is fundamentally sound.  The majority of it appears to have originally come \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \nout of the study of the Bible by many individuals. \n   In effective personal leadership, visualization and affirmation techniques emerge naturally out of a \nfoundation of well thought through purposes and princi ples that become the center of a person's life.  \nThey are extremely powerful in rescripting and reprogramming, into writing deeply committed-to \npurposes and principles into one's heart and mind.  I believe that central to all enduring religions in \nsociety are the same principles and practices clot hed in different language  -- meditation, prayer, \ncovenants, ordinances, scripture study, empathy, co mpassion, and many differ ent forms of the use of \nboth conscience and imagination.    But if these techniques become part of the pers onality ethic and are severe d from a base of character \nand principles, they can be misused and abused in serving other centers, primarily the self center. \n   Affirmation and visualization are forms of pr ogramming, and we must be certain that we do not \nsubmit ourselves to any programming that is not in harmony with our basic cent er or that comes from \nsources centered on money-making, self interest , or anything other than correct principles. \n   The imagination can be used to achieve the fleet ing success that comes when a person is focused on \nmaterial gain or on \"what's in it for me.\" But I belie ve the higher use of imagin ation is in harmony with \nthe use of conscience to transcend self and create a life of contribution based on unique purpose and on \nthe principles that govern interdependent reality.  Identifying Roles and Goals     Of course, the logical/verbal left brain become s important also as you attempt to capture your \nright-brain images, feelings, and pictures in the words of a written mission statement.  Just as \nbreathing exercises help integrate body and mind, wr iting is a kind of psycho-neural muscular activity \nwhich helps bridge and integrate the conscious and subconscious minds.  Writing distills, crystallizes, \nand clarifies thought and helps break the whole into parts.    We each have a number of different roles in ou r lives -- different areas or capacities in which we \nhave responsibility.  I may, for example, have a role as an individual, a husband, a father, a teacher, a church member, and a businessman.  An d each of these roles is important. \n   One of the major problems that arises when people work to become more effective in life is that they \ndon't think broadly enough.  They lose the sense of proportion, the balance, the natural ecology \nnecessary to effective living.  They may get consum ed by work and neglect personal health.  In the \nname of professional success, they may neglect th e most precious relationships in their lives. \n   You may find that your mission statement will be much more balanced, much easier to work with, if \nyou break it down into the specific role areas of yo ur life and the goals you wa nt to accomplish in each \narea.  Look at your professional role.  You might be a salesperson, or a manager, or a product developer.  What are you about in th at area? What are the values that should guide you? Think of your \npersonal roles -- husband, wife, father, mother, neig hbor, friend.  What are you about in those roles? \nWhat's important to you? Think of community role s -- the political area, public service, volunteer \norganizations.    One executive has used the idea of roles and goals to create the follo wing mission statement: \n   My mission is to live with integrity an d to make a difference in the lives of others. \n   To fulfill this mission:    I have charity: I seek out and love the one -- each one -- regardless of his situation. \n   I sacrifice: I devote my time, talents, and",

Some of the more rece nt developments in this field include such things \nas subliminal programming, neurolinguistic program ming, and new forms of relaxation and self-talk \nprocesses.  These all involve explanation, elabo ration, and different packaging of the fundamental \nprinciples of the first creation.    My review of the success literature brought me in contact with hundreds of books on this subject.  \nAlthough some made extravagant claims and relied on  anecdotal rather than sci entific evidence, I think \nthat most of the material is fundamentally sound.  The majority of it appears to have originally come \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \nout of the study of the Bible by many individuals. \n   In effective personal leadership, visualization and affirmation techniques emerge naturally out of a \nfoundation of well thought through purposes and princi ples that become the center of a person's life.  \nThey are extremely powerful in rescripting and reprogramming, into writing deeply committed-to \npurposes and principles into one's heart and mind.  I believe that central to all enduring religions in \nsociety are the same principles and practices clot hed in different language  -- meditation, prayer, \ncovenants, ordinances, scripture study, empathy, co mpassion, and many differ ent forms of the use of \nboth conscience and imagination.    But if these techniques become part of the pers onality ethic and are severe d from a base of character \nand principles, they can be misused and abused in serving other centers, primarily the self center. \n   Affirmation and visualization are forms of pr ogramming, and we must be certain that we do not \nsubmit ourselves to any programming that is not in harmony with our basic cent er or that comes from \nsources centered on money-making, self interest , or anything other than correct principles. \n   The imagination can be used to achieve the fleet ing success that comes when a person is focused on \nmaterial gain or on \"what's in it for me.\" But I belie ve the higher use of imagin ation is in",

Identifying Roles and Goals     Of course, the logical/verbal left brain become s important also as you attempt to capture your \nright-brain images, feelings, and pictures in the words of a written mission statement.  Just as \nbreathing exercises help integrate body and mind, wr iting is a kind of psycho-neural muscular activity \nwhich helps bridge and integrate the conscious and subconscious minds.  Writing distills, crystallizes, \nand clarifies thought and helps break the whole into parts.    We each have a number of different roles in ou r lives -- different areas or capacities in which we \nhave responsibility.  I may, for example, have a role as an individual, a husband, a father, a teacher, a church member, and a businessman.

They lose the sense of proportion, the balance, the natural ecology \nnecessary to effective living.  They may get consum ed by work and neglect personal health.  In the \nname of professional success, they may neglect th e most precious relationships in their lives. \n   You may find that your mission statement will be much more balanced, much easier to work with, if \nyou break it down into the specific role areas of yo ur life and the goals you wa nt to accomplish in each \narea.  Look at your professional role.  You might be a salesperson, or a manager, or a product developer.  What are you about in th at area? What are the values that should guide you? Think of your \npersonal roles -- husband, wife, father, mother, neig hbor, friend.  What are you about in those roles? \nWhat's important to you? Think of community role s -- the political area, public service, volunteer \norganizations.    One executive has used the idea of roles and goals to create the follo wing mission statement: \n   My mission is to live with integrity an d to",

An d each of these roles is important. \n   One of the major problems that arises when people work to become more effective in life is that they \ndon't think broadly enough.  They lose the sense of proportion, the balance, the natural ecology \nnecessary to effective living.  They may get consum ed by work and neglect personal health.  In the \nname of professional success, they may neglect th e most precious relationships in their lives. \n   You may find that your mission statement will be much more balanced, much easier to work with, if \nyou break it down into the specific role areas of yo ur life and the goals you wa nt to accomplish in each \narea.  Look at your professional role.  You might be a salesperson, or a manager, or a product developer.  What are you about in th at area? What are the values that should guide you? Think of your \npersonal roles -- husband, wife, father, mother, neig hbor, friend.  What are you about in those roles? \nWhat's important to you",

I inspire: I teach by example that we are all children of a loving  Heavenly Father and that every \nGoliath can be overcome.    I am impactful: What I do makes a difference in the lives of others. \n   These roles take priority in achieving my mission: \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n   Husband -- my partner is the most important pers on in my life.  Together we contribute the fruits \nof harmony, industry, charity, and thrift.    Father -- I help my children experience progressively greater joy in their lives.    Son/Brother -- I am frequently \"there\" for support and love.    Christian -- God can count on me to keep my covenants and to serve his other children. \n   Neighbor -- The love of Christ is visible through my actions toward others. \n   Change Agent -- I am a catalyst for develo ping high performance in large organizations. \n   Scholar -- I learn important new things every day.    Writing your mission in terms of the important roles in your life gives yo u balance and harmony.  \nIt keeps each role clearly before you.  You can revi ew your roles frequently to make sure that you don't \nget totally absorbed by one role to the exclusion of others that are equally or  even more important in \nyour life.    After you identify your various roles, then yo u can think about the Long Term Goals are plans you \nmake that support the principles described in your  Mission Statement.  These goals should represent \nareas you want to focus on in the near future.  Typi cally, Long Term Goals take  longer than a week to \ncomplete, but are most specific than the lifetime go als of your Mission Statement.long-term goals you \nwant to accomplish in each of those roles.  We'r e into the right brain ag ain, using imagination, \ncreativity, conscience, and inspiratio n.  If these goals are the extensio n of a mission statement based on \ncorrect principles, they will be vitally different from  the goals people normally set.  They will be in \nharmony with correct principles, with natural laws , which gives you greater power to achieve them.  \nThey are not someone else's goals yo u have absorbed.  They are your go als.  They reflect your deepest \nvalues, your unique talent, your sense of mission.  And they grow out of your chosen roles in life. \n   An effective goal focuses primarily on results rat her than activity.  It identifies where you want to \nbe, and, in the process, helps you determine wher e you are.  It gives you important information on \nhow to get there, and it tells you when you have arrive d.  It unifies your efforts and energy.  It gives \nmeaning and purpose to all you do.  And it can finally translate itself into daily  activities so that you \nare proactive, you are in charge of your life, you are  making happen each day the things that will enable \nyou to fulfill your personal mission statement.    Roles and goals give structure and organized dire ction to your personal mi ssion.  If you don't yet \nhave a personal mission statement, it's a good place to begin.  Just identifying the various areas of your \nlife and the two or three important results you feel you should accomplish in each area to move ahead \ngives you an overall perspective of your life and a sense of direction.    As we move into Habit 3, we'll go into greater de pth in the area of short-term goals.  The important \napplication at this point is to iden tify roles and long-term goals as they  relate to your personal mission \nstatement.  These roles and long-term goals will prov ide the foundation for effective goal setting and \nachieving when we get to the Habit 3 day-to-day management of life and time.  Family Mission Statements     Because Habit 2 is based on principle, it has broa d application.  In addition to individuals, families, \nservice groups, and organizations of all kinds become significantly more effective as they Begin with the \nEnd in Mind.    Many families are managed on the basis of crises , moods, quick fixes, and instant gratification -- not \non sound principles.  Symptoms surface whenever st ress and pressure mount: people become cynical, \ncritical, or silent or they",

We'r e into the right brain ag ain, using imagination, \ncreativity, conscience, and inspiratio n.  If these goals are the extensio n of a mission statement based on \ncorrect principles, they will be vitally different from  the goals people normally set.  They will be in \nharmony with correct principles, with natural laws , which gives you greater power to achieve them.  \nThey are not someone else's goals yo u have absorbed.  They are your go als.  They reflect your deepest \nvalues, your unique talent, your sense of mission.  And they grow out of your chosen roles in life. \n   An effective goal focuses primarily on results rat her than activity.  It identifies where you want to \nbe, and, in the process, helps you determine wher e you are.  It gives you important information on \nhow to get there, and it tells you when you have arrive d.  It unifies your efforts and energy.  It gives \nmeaning and purpose to all you do.  And it can finally translate itself into daily  activities so that you \nare proactive, you are in charge of your life, you are  making happen each day the things that will enable \nyou to fulfill your personal mission statement.    Roles and goals give structure and organized dire ction to your personal mi ssion.  If you don't yet \nhave a personal mission statement, it's a good place to begin.  Just identifying the various areas of your \nlife and the two or three important results you feel you should accomplish in each area to move ahead \ngives you an overall perspective of your life and a sense of direction.    As we move into Habit 3, we'll go into greater de pth in the area of short-term goals.  The important \napplication at this point is to iden tify roles and long-term goals as they  relate to your personal mission \nstatement.  These roles and long-term goals will prov ide the foundation for effective goal setting and \nachieving when we get to the Habit 3 day-to-day management of life and time.  Family Mission Statements     Because Habit 2 is based on principle, it has broa d application.  In addition to individuals, families, \nservice groups, and organizations of all kinds become significantly more effective as they Begin with the \nEnd in Mind.",

    "text": "    Many families are managed on the basis of crises , moods, quick fixes, and instant gratification -- not \non sound principles.  Symptoms surface whenever st ress and pressure mount: people become cynical, \ncritical, or silent or they start yelling and overre acting.  Children who observe these kinds of behavior \ngrow up thinking the only way to solve problems is flight or fight.    The core of any family is what is changeless, what is always going to be there -- shared vision and \nvalues.  By writing a family mission statement,  you give expression to its true foundation. \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n   This mission statement becomes its constituti on, the standard, the crit erion for evaluation and \ndecision making.  It gives continuity and unity to th e family as well as direction.  When individual \nvalues are harmonized with those of the family, members work togeth er for common purposes that are \ndeeply felt.    Again, the process is as important as the prod uct.  The very process of writing and refining a \nmission statement becomes a key way to improve the family.  Working together to create a mission \nstatement builds the PC capacity to live it.    By getting input from every family member, draf ting a statement, getting feedback, revising it, and \nusing wording from different family members, you get the family talking, communicating, on things \nthat really matter deeply.  The best mission stat ements are the result of family members coming \ntogether in a spirit of mutual re spect, expressing their different vi ews, and working together to create \nsomething greater than any one indi vidual could do alone.  Periodic review to  expand perspective, \nshift emphasis or direction, amend or give new meaning to time-worn phrases can keep the family \nunited in common values and purposes.    The mission statement becomes the framework fo r thinking, for governing the family.  When the \nproblems and crises come, the constitution is there to remind family members of the things that matter \nmost and to provide direction for problem solving and decision making base d on correct principles. \n   In our home, we put our mission statement up on a wall in the family room so that we can look at it \nand monitor ourselves daily.  When we read the phras es about the sounds of love in our home, order, \nresponsible independence, cooperation, helpfulness,  meeting needs, develo ping talents, showing \ninterest in each other's talents, and giving service to  others it gives us some criteria to know how we're \ndoing in the things that matter most to us as a family.    When we plan our family goals and activities, we sa y, \"In light of these prin ciples, what are the goals \nwe're going to work on? What are our action plans to accomplish our goals and actualize these values?\" \n   We review the statement frequently and rework  goals and jobs twice a year, in September and June \n-- the beginning of school and the end of school -- to reflect the situation as it is, to improve it, to \nstrengthen it.  It renews us, it recommits us to what we believe in, what we stand for. \n Organizational Mission Statements     Mission statements are also vital to successful organizations.  One of the most important thrusts of \nmy work with organizations is to assist them in developing effective mission statements.  And to be \neffective, that statement has to come from within  the bowels of the organization.  Everyone should \nparticipate in a meaningful way -- not just the top strategy planners, but everyone.  Once again, the \ninvolvement process is as important as the written product and is the key to its use. \n   I am always intrigued whenever I go to IBM an d watch the training process there.  Time and time \nagain, I see the leadership of the organization come  into a group and say th at IBM stands for three \nthings: the dignity of the indivi dual, excellence, and service. \n   These things represent the belief system of IBM.   Everything else will change, but these three things \nwill not change.  Almost like osmosis, this belief syst em has spread throughout the entire organization, \nproviding a tremendous base of shared values and personal security for everyone who works there. \n   Once I was training a group of people for IBM in New York.  It was small group, about 20 people, \nand one of them became ill.  He called his wife in  California, who expressed concern because his illness \n",

    "text": "    Many families are managed on the basis of crises , moods, quick fixes, and instant gratification -- not \non sound principles.  Symptoms surface whenever st ress and pressure mount: people become cynical, \ncritical, or silent or they start yelling and overre acting.  Children who observe these kinds of behavior \ngrow up thinking the only way to solve problems is flight or fight.    The core of any family is what is changeless, what is always going to be there -- shared vision and \nvalues.  By writing a family mission statement,  you give expression to its true foundation. \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n   This mission statement becomes its constituti on, the standard, the crit erion for evaluation and \ndecision making.  It gives continuity and unity to th e family as well as direction.  When individual \nvalues are harmonized with those of the family, members work togeth er for common purposes that are \ndeeply felt.    Again, the process is as important as the prod uct.  The very process of writing and refining a \nmission statement becomes a key way to improve the family.  Working together to create a mission \nstatement builds the PC capacity to live it.    By getting input from every family member, draf ting a statement, getting feedback, revising it, and \nusing wording from different family members, you get the family talking, communicating, on things \nthat really matter deeply.  The best mission stat ements are the result of family members coming \ntogether in a spirit of mutual re spect, expressing their different vi ews, and working together to create \nsomething greater than any one indi vidual could do alone.  Periodic review to  expand perspective, \nshift emphasis or direction, amend or give new meaning to time-worn phrases can keep the family \nunited in common values and purposes.    The mission statement becomes the framework fo r thinking, for governing the family.  When the \nproblems and crises come, the constitution is there to remind family members of the things that matter \nmost and to provide direction for problem solving and decision making base d on correct principles. \n   In our",

    "text": "    Many families are managed on the basis of crises , moods, quick fixes, and instant gratification -- not \non sound principles.  Symptoms surface whenever st ress and pressure mount: people become cynical, \ncritical, or silent or they start yelling and overre acting.  Children who observe these kinds of behavior \ngrow up thinking the only way to solve problems is flight or fight.    The core of any family is what is changeless, what is always going to be there -- shared vision and \nvalues.  By writing a family mission statement,  you give expression to its true foundation. \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n   This mission statement becomes its constituti on, the standard, the crit erion for evaluation and \ndecision making.

When individual \nvalues are harmonized with those of the family, members work togeth er for common purposes that are \ndeeply felt.    Again, the process is as important as the prod uct.  The very process of writing and refining a \nmission statement becomes a key way to improve the family.  Working together to create a mission \nstatement builds the PC capacity to live it.    By getting input from every family member, draf ting a statement, getting feedback, revising it, and \nusing wording from different family members, you get the family talking, communicating, on things \nthat really matter deeply.  The best mission stat ements are the result of family members coming \ntogether in a spirit of mutual re spect, expressing their different vi ews, and working together to create \nsomething greater than any one indi vidual could do alone.  Periodic review to  expand perspective, \nshift emphasis or direction, amend or give new meaning to time-worn phrases can keep the family \nunited in common values and purposes.    The mission statement becomes the framework fo r thinking",

    "text": ", for governing the family.  When the \nproblems and crises come, the constitution is there to remind family members of the things that matter \nmost and to provide direction for problem solving and decision making base d on correct principles. \n   In our home, we put our mission statement up on a wall in the family room so that we can look at it \nand monitor ourselves daily.  When we read the phras es about the sounds of love in our home, order, \nresponsible independence, cooperation, helpfulness,  meeting needs, develo ping talents, showing \ninterest in each other's talents, and giving service to  others it gives us some criteria to know how we're \ndoing in the things that matter most to us as a family.    When we plan our family goals and activities, we sa y, \"In light of these prin ciples, what are the goals \nwe're going to work on? What are our action plans to accomplish our goals and actualize these values?\" \n   We review the statement frequently and rework  goals and jobs twice a year, in September and June \n-- the beginning of school and the end of school -- to reflect the situation as it is, to improve it, to \nstrengthen it.  It renews us, it recommits us to what we believe in, what we stand for. \n Organizational Mission Statements     Mission statements are also vital to successful organizations.  One of the most important thrusts of \nmy work with organizations is to assist them in developing effective mission statements.  And to be \neffective, that statement has to come from within  the bowels of the organization.  Everyone should \nparticipate in a meaningful way -- not just the top strategy planners, but everyone.  Once again, the \ninvolvement process is as important as the written product and is the key to its use. \n   I am always intrigued whenever I go to IBM an d watch the training process there.  Time and time \nagain, I see the leadership of the organization come  into a group and say th at IBM stands for three \nthings: the dignity of the indivi dual, excellence, and service. \n   These things represent the belief system of IBM.   Everything else will change, but these three things \nwill not change.  Almost like osmosis, this belief syst em has spread throughout the entire organization, \nproviding a tremendous base of shared values and personal security for everyone who works there. \n",

When the \nproblems and crises come, the constitution is there to remind family members of the things that matter \nmost and to provide direction for problem solving and decision making base d on correct principles. \n   In our home, we put our mission statement up on a wall in the family room so that we can look at it \nand monitor ourselves daily.  When we read the phras es about the sounds of love in our home, order, \nresponsible independence, cooperation, helpfulness,  meeting needs, develo ping talents, showing \ninterest in each other's talents, and giving service to  others it gives us some criteria to know how we're \ndoing in the things that matter most to us as a family.    When we plan our family goals and activities, we sa y, \"In light of these prin ciples, what are the goals \nwe're going to work on? What are our action plans to accomplish our goals and actualize these values?\" \n   We review the statement frequently and rework  goals and jobs twice a year, in September and June \n-- the beginning of school and the end of school -- to reflect the situation as it is, to improve it, to \nstrengthen it",

One of the most important thrusts of \nmy work with organizations is to assist them in developing effective mission statements.  And to be \neffective, that statement has to come from within  the bowels of the organization.  Everyone should \nparticipate in a meaningful way -- not just the top strategy planners, but everyone.

    "text": "   Once I was training a group of people for IBM in New York.  It was small group, about 20 people, \nand one of them became ill.  He called his wife in  California, who expressed concern because his illness \nrequired a special treatment.  The IBM people resp onsible for the training session arranged to have \nhim taken to an excellent hospital with medical specia lists in the disease.  But they could sense that his \nwife was uncertain and really wanted him home where their personal physician could handle the \nproblem.    So they decided to get him home.  Concerned ab out the time involved in driving him to the airport \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \nand waiting for a commercial plane, they brought in a helicopter, flew him to the airport, and hired a \nspecial plane just to take this man to California.    I don't know what costs that involved; my gu ess would be many thousands of dollars.  But IBM \nbelieves in the dignity of the indivi dual.  That's what the company stan ds for.  To those present, that \nexperience represented its belief system and was no surprise.  I was impressed.    At another time, I was scheduled to train 175 sho pping center managers at a particular hotel.  I was \namazed at the level of service there.  It wasn't a cosmetic thing.  It was evident at all levels, \nspontaneously, without supervision.    I arrived quite late, checked in, and asked if room  service were available.  The man at the desk said, \n\"No, Mr. Covey, but if you're interested, I could go back and get a sandwich or a salad or whatever \nyou'd like that we have in the kitchen.\" His attitu de was one of total concern about my comfort and \nwelfare.  \"Would you like to see your convention room?\" he continued.  \"Do you have everything you need? What can I do for you? I'm here to serve you.\"    There was no supervisor there checking up.  This man was sincere.    The next day I was in the mi ddle of a presentation when I disco vered that I didn't have all the \ncolored markers I needed.  So I went out into th e hall during the brief break and found a bellboy \nrunning to another convention.  \"I've got a problem,\" I said.  \"I'm here training a group of managers \nand I only have a short break.  I need some more colored pens.    He whipped around and almost came to attent ion.  He glanced at my name tag and said, \"Mr. \nCovey, I will solve your problem.\"    He didn't say, \"I don't know where to go\" or \"we ll, go and check the front desk .\" He just took care of \nit.  And he made me feel like it was his privilege to do so.    Later, I was in the side lobby, looking at some of the art objects.   Someone from the hotel came up \nto me and said, \"Mr. Covey, would yo u like to see a book that describes  the art objects in this hotel?\" \nHow anticipatory! How service-oriented!    I next observed one of the employees high up on a ladder cleaning windows in the lobby.  From his \nvantage point he saw a woman having a little difficulty in the garden with a walk er.  She hadn't really \nfallen, and she was with other people.  But he cl imbed down that ladder, went outside, helped the \nwoman into the lobby and saw that she was properly taken care of.  Then he went back and finished \ncleaning the windows.    I wanted to find out how this organization had cr eated a culture where people bought so deeply into \nthe value of customer service.  I interviewed housekeepers, waitre sses, bellboys in that hotel and \nfound that this attitude had impregnated the mind s, hearts, and attitudes of every employee there. \n   I went through the back door into the kitche n, where I saw the central value: \"Uncompromising \npersonalized service.\" I finally we nt to the manager and said, \"My business is helping organizations \ndevelop a powerful team character, a team cultur e.  I am amazed at what you have here.\" \n   \"Do you want to know the real key?\" he inquir ed.  He pulled out the mission statement for the hotel \nchain.    After reading it, I acknowledged, \"That's an im press",

He called his wife in  California, who expressed concern because his illness \nrequired a special treatment.  The IBM people resp onsible for the training session arranged to have \nhim taken to an excellent hospital with medical specia lists in the disease.  But they could sense that his \nwife was uncertain and really wanted him home where their personal physician could handle the \nproblem.    So they decided to get him home.  Concerned ab out the time involved in driving him to the airport \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \nand waiting for a commercial plane, they brought in a helicopter, flew him to the airport, and hired a \nspecial plane just to take this man to California.    I don't know what costs that involved; my gu ess would be many thousands of dollars.  But IBM \nbelieves in the dignity of the indivi dual.  That's what the company stan ds for.  To those present, that \nexperience represented its belief system and was no surprise.  I was impressed.    At another time, I was scheduled to train 175 sho pping center managers at a particular hotel.  I was \namazed at the level of service there.  It wasn't a cosmetic thing.  It was evident at all levels, \nspontaneously, without supervision.    I arrived quite late, checked in, and asked if room  service were available.  The man at the desk said, \n\"No, Mr. Covey, but if you're interested, I could go back and get a sandwich or a salad or whatever \nyou'd like that we have in the kitchen.\" His attitu de was one of total concern about my comfort and \nwelfare.  \"Would you like to see your convention room?\" he continued.  \"Do you have everything you need? What can I do for you? I'm here to serve you.\"    There was no supervisor there checking up.  This man was sincere.    The next day I was in the mi ddle of a presentation",

    "text": "Do you have everything you need? What can I do for you? I'm here to serve you.\"    There was no supervisor there checking up.  This man was sincere.    The next day I was in the mi ddle of a presentation when I disco vered that I didn't have all the \ncolored markers I needed.  So I went out into th e hall during the brief break and found a bellboy \nrunning to another convention.  \"I've got a problem,\" I said.  \"I'm here training a group of managers \nand I only have a short break.  I need some more colored pens.    He whipped around and almost came to attent ion.  He glanced at my name tag and said, \"Mr. \nCovey, I will solve your problem.\"    He didn't say, \"I don't know where to go\" or \"we ll, go and check the front desk .\" He just took care of \nit.  And he made me feel like it was his privilege to do so.    Later, I was in the side lobby, looking at some of the art objects.   Someone from the hotel came up \nto me and said, \"Mr. Covey, would yo u like to see a book that describes  the art objects in this hotel?\" \nHow anticipatory! How service-oriented!    I next observed one of the employees high up on a ladder cleaning windows in the lobby.  From his \nvantage point he saw a woman having a little difficulty in the garden with a walk er.  She hadn't really \nfallen, and she was with other people.  But he cl imbed down that ladder, went outside, helped the \nwoman into the lobby and saw that she was properly taken care of.  Then he went back and finished \ncleaning the windows.    I wanted to find out how this organization had cr eated a culture where people bought so deeply into \nthe value of customer service.  I interviewed housekeepers, waitre sses, bellboys in that hotel and \nfound that this attitude had impregnated the mind s, hearts, and attitudes of every employee there. \n   I went through the back door into the kitche n, where I saw the central value: \"Uncompromising \npersonalized service.\" I finally we nt to the manager and said, \"My business is helping organizations \ndevelop a powerful team character, a team cultur e.  I am amazed",

It's in harmony with that statement, but this one pertains to our situation, our environment, \nour time.\" He handed me another paper.    \"Who developed this mission statement?\" I asked.    \"Everybody,\" he replied. \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n   \"Everybody? Really, everybody?\" \n   \" Y e s . \"     \"Housekeepers?\"    \" Y e s . \"     \"Waitresses?\"    \" Y e s . \"     \"Desk clerks?\"    \"Yes.  Do you want to see the mission statemen t written by the people who greeted you last night?\" \nHe pulled out a mission statement that they, themselv es, had written that was interwoven with all the \nother mission statements.  Everyone, at every level, was involved.    The mission statement for that hotel was the hub of a great wheel.  It spawned the thoughtful, more \nspecialized mission statements of particular groups of employees.  It was used as the criterion for \nevery decision that was made.  It clarified what those people stood for -- how they related to the \ncustomer, how they related to each other.  It affect ed the style of the manage rs and the leaders.  It \naffected the compensation system.  It affected the kind of people they recruited and how they trained \nand developed them.  Every aspect of  that organization, essentially, wa s a function of that hub, that \nmission statement.    I later visited another hotel in the same chain, and the first thing I did when  I checked in was to ask \nto see their mission statement, whic h they promptly gave me.  At this  hotel, I came to understand the \nmotto \"Uncompromising personalized service\" a little more.    For a three-day period, I watched every conc eivable situation where service was called for.  I \nalways found that service was delivered in a very im pressive, excellent way.  But it was always also \nvery personalized.  For instance, in the swimmi ng area I asked the attendant where the drinking \nfountain was.  He walked me to it.    But the thing that impressed me the very most was to see an employee, on his own, admit a mistake \nto his boss.  We ordered room service, and were told  when it would be delivered to the room.  On the \nway to our room, the room service person spilled the hot chocolate, and it took  a few extra minutes to \ngo back and change the linen on the tray and replac e the drink.  So the room service was about fifteen \nminutes late, which was really not that important to us.    Nevertheless, the next morning the room service manager phoned us to apologize and invited us to \nhave either the buffet breakfast or a room service br eakfast, compliments of th e hotel, to in some way \ncompensate for the inconvenience.    What does it say about the culture of an orga nization when an employee admits his own mistake, \nunknown to anyone else, to the manager so that  customer or guest is better taken care of! \n   As I told the manager of the first hotel I visite d, I know a lot of companies with impressive mission \nstatements.  But there is a real difference, all the difference in the world, in the effectiveness of a \nmission statement created by everyone involved in the organization and one written by a few top \nexecutives behind a mahogany wall.    One of the fundamental problems in organizat ions, including families, is that people are not \ncommitted to the determinations of other people fo r their lives.  They simply don't buy into them. \n   Many times as I work with organizations, I find  people whose goals are totally different from the \ngoals of the enterprise.  I commonly find reward systems completely out of alignment with stated \nvalue systems.    When I begin work with companies that have al ready developed some kind of mission statement, I \nask them, \"How many of the people here",

It clarified what those people stood for -- how they related to the \ncustomer, how they related to each other.  It affect ed the style of the manage rs and the leaders.  It \naffected the compensation system.  It affected the kind of people they recruited and how they trained \nand developed them.

    "text": " Every aspect of  that organization, essentially, wa s a function of that hub, that \nmission statement.    I later visited another hotel in the same chain, and the first thing I did when  I checked in was to ask \nto see their mission statement, whic h they promptly gave me.  At this  hotel, I came to understand the \nmotto \"Uncompromising personalized service\" a little more.    For a three-day period, I watched every conc eivable situation where service was called for.  I \nalways found that service was delivered in a very im pressive, excellent way.  But it was always also \nvery personalized.  For instance, in the swimmi ng area I asked the attendant where the drinking \nfountain was.  He walked me to it.    But the thing that impressed me the very most was to see an employee, on his own, admit a mistake \nto his boss.  We ordered room service, and were told  when it would be delivered to the room.  On the \nway to our room, the room service person spilled the hot chocolate, and it took  a few extra minutes to \ngo back and change the linen on the tray and replac e the drink.  So the room service was about fifteen \nminutes late, which was really not that important to us.    Nevertheless, the next morning the room service manager phoned us to apologize and invited us to \nhave either the buffet breakfast or a room service br eakfast, compliments of th e hotel, to in some way \ncompensate for the inconvenience.    What does it say about the culture of an orga nization when an employee admits his own mistake, \nunknown to anyone else, to the manager so that  customer or guest is better taken care of! \n   As I told the manager of the first hotel I visite d, I know a lot of companies with impressive mission \nstatements.  But there is a real difference, all the difference in the world, in the effectiveness of a \nmission statement created by everyone involved in the organization and one written by a few top \nexecutives behind a mahogany wall.    One of the fundamental problems in organizat ions, including families, is that people are not \ncommitted to the determinations of other people fo r their lives.  They simply don't buy into them. \n   Many times as I work with organizations, I find  people whose goals are totally different from the \ngoals",

I later visited another hotel in the same chain, and the first thing I did when  I checked in was to ask \nto see their mission statement, whic h they promptly gave me.  At this  hotel, I came to understand the \nmotto \"Uncompromising personalized service\" a little more.    For a three-day period, I watched every conc eivable situation where service was called for.  I \nalways found that service was delivered in a very im pressive, excellent way.  But it was always also \nvery personalized.  For instance, in the swimmi ng area I asked the attendant where the drinking \nfountain was.  He walked me to it.    But the thing that impressed me the very most was to see an employee, on his own, admit a mistake \nto his boss.  We ordered room service, and were told  when it would be delivered to the room.  On the \nway to our room, the room service person spilled the hot chocolate, and it took  a few extra minutes to \ngo back and change the linen on the tray and replac e the drink",
