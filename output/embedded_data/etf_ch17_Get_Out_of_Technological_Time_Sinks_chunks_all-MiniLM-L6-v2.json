As we race\ninto the 21st century, bombarded by information from all sides, many\npeople seem to have an irresistible, if not obsessive, need tocommunicate continually and non-stop with people everywhere – in\ntheir personal and business lives.\nThis incessant, non-stop compulsion to communicate, entailing the\ncontinuous use of cell phones, Blackberries, personal digital\nassistants, Internet – both wireless and connected, and various\ncontact management systems like Microsoft Outlook, Maximizer andothers, tends to leave a person psychologically breathless. He or she\nhas no time to stop, smell the roses and collect his thoughts.\nYou Have a Choice\nAt the same time, there are many high-powered, hard-working,\nhighly productive people functioning in the dead center of\ncommunications technology who are not overwhelmed by\ntechnology. They seem to have their lives largely under control.\nBill Gross, Manager of more than 600 billion dollars in fixed income\nfunds and bonds, is famous for exercising regularly and meditating\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 97daily to keep centered while using no technology at all. He turns off\nhis cell phone, cuts off his live phone, leaves his Blackberry in his\noffice, and goes about his daily business without the continuous\ninterruptions of people who have an overwhelming need to stayconnected. And he says that he never misses an important message.\nFor you to stay calm, clear headed and capable of performing at your\nbest, you need to detach on a regular basis from the technology andcommunication devices that can overwhelm you if you are notcareful.\nDon’t Become Addicted\nIn Washington not long ago, I was at a business luncheon with a\nroomful of high-level executives. Prior to the beginning the luncheon,\none of the organizers stood up and gave a short grace. Everyonebowed their head. When the grace was over, the luncheon began.\nHowever, at my table, four or five out of the eight people seemed to\nhave been greatly affected by the prayer that had preceded the\nluncheon. They still had their heads down with their hands in their\nlap, even when they served the food. Each of them seemed to be lost\nin deep thought over the profound questions of the day.\nThen I realized that they were not praying at all. Each of them was\nintensely focused on their Blackberries, sending and receiving email,\nworking their little keyboards like frantic teenagers playing a video\ngame. They were all lost to the world around them as they messaged\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 98back and forth, some of them with other people in the same room.\nThey had fallen into a technological trap, a deep sink full of\ninformation exchange in which they were drowning.\nTechnology is Your Friend\nThe purpose of modern technology is largely to increase the speed,\nefficiency and accuracy of the transfer of information of all kinds.Technology is meant to help us to improve the quality of our lives byenabling us to accomplish our key tasks and communicate with the\nkey people in our world faster and more efficiently than ever before.\nBut the use of communications technology can quickly become a\nform of addiction. People get up in the morning and immediately\ncheck to see if there were any phone calls or voice mail messages on\ntheir cell phones. They then race to their computers to pull up theiremail to see if anyone communicated with them overnight. They call\nthe office to find out if anyone has done or said anything that they\nshould know about in the last few hours. They check their Microsoft\nOutlook, their personal digital assistants, their Blackberries and\nwhatever other form of communications technology they are using\nevery five or six minutes to make sure that they are not missing\nanything. This has to stop before it gets out of control.\nTake Back Your Time\nOne of my clients, with distributors in 19 states, found himself bound\nand chained to his computer, receiving and responding to emails\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 99several hours each day. The more time he spent at his computer, the\nfewer of his other important tasks he was able to get done. The stress\nof these tasks, building up like an avalanche overhang, started to\naffect his personality, his health and his sleeping habits.\nUsing the principles taught in Eat That Frog!, we taught him about\nthe 80/20 Rule and how it applies to emails. Fully 80% of the emails\nthat you receive are of no value, and should not even be opened.They should be deleted immediately.\nOf the remaining 20%, only 20% of those, or 4% of your emails,\nactually require an",

As we race\ninto the 21st century, bombarded by information from all sides, many\npeople seem to have an irresistible, if not obsessive, need tocommunicate continually and non-stop with people everywhere – in\ntheir personal and business lives.\nThis incessant, non-stop compulsion to communicate, entailing the\ncontinuous use of cell phones, Blackberries, personal digital\nassistants, Internet – both wireless and connected, and various\ncontact management systems like Microsoft Outlook, Maximizer andothers, tends to leave a person psychologically breathless. He or she\nhas no time to stop, smell the roses and collect his thoughts.\nYou Have a Choice\nAt the same time, there are many high-powered, hard-working,\nhighly productive people functioning in the dead center of\ncommunications technology who are not overwhelmed by\ntechnology. They seem to have their lives largely under control.\nBill Gross, Manager of more than 600 billion dollars in fixed income\nfunds and bonds, is famous for exercising regularly and meditating\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 97daily to keep centered while using no technology at all. He turns off\nhis cell phone, cuts off his live phone, leaves his Blackberry in his\noffice, and goes about his daily business without the continuous\ninterruptions of people who have an overwhelming need to stayconnected. And he says that he never misses an important message.\nFor you to stay calm, clear headed and capable of performing at your\nbest, you need to detach on a regular basis from the technology andcommunication devices that can overwhelm you if you are notcareful.\nDon’t Become Addicted\nIn Washington not long ago, I was at a business luncheon with a\nroomful of high-level executives. Prior to the beginning the luncheon,\none of the organizers stood up and gave a short grace. Everyonebowed their head. When the grace was over, the luncheon began.\nHowever, at my table, four or five out of the eight people seemed to\nhave been greatly affected by the prayer that had preceded the\nluncheon. They still had their heads down with their hands in their\nlap, even when they served the food. Each of them seemed to be lost\nin deep",

Each of them seemed to be lost\nin deep thought over the profound questions of the day.\nThen I realized that they were not praying at all. Each of them was\nintensely focused on their Blackberries, sending and receiving email,\nworking their little keyboards like frantic teenagers playing a video\ngame. They were all lost to the world around them as they messaged\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 98back and forth, some of them with other people in the same room.\nThey had fallen into a technological trap, a deep sink full of\ninformation exchange in which they were drowning.\nTechnology is Your Friend\nThe purpose of modern technology is largely to increase the speed,\nefficiency and accuracy of the transfer of information of all kinds.Technology is meant to help us to improve the quality of our lives byenabling us to accomplish our key tasks and communicate with the\nkey people in our world faster and more efficiently than ever before.\nBut the use of communications technology can quickly become a\nform of addiction. People get up in the morning and immediately\ncheck to see if there were any phone calls or voice mail messages on\ntheir cell phones. They then race to their computers to pull up theiremail to see if anyone communicated with them overnight. They call\nthe office to find out if anyone has done or said anything that they\nshould know about in the last few hours. They check their Microsoft\nOutlook, their personal digital assistants, their Blackberries and\nwhatever other form of communications technology they are using\nevery five or six minutes to make sure that they are not missing\nanything. This has to stop before it gets out of control.\nTake Back Your Time\nOne of my clients, with distributors in 19 states, found himself bound\nand chained to his computer, receiving and responding to emails\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 99several hours each day. The more time he spent at his computer, the\nfewer of his other important tasks he was able to get done. The stress\nof these tasks, building up like an avalanche overhang, started to\naffect his personality, his health and his sleeping habits.\nUsing the principles taught in Eat That Frog!, we taught him about\nthe 80/20 Rule and how it applies to emails.

    "text": "80% of the emails\nthat you receive are of no value, and should not even be opened.They should be deleted immediately.\nOf the remaining 20%, only 20% of those, or 4% of your emails,\nactually require an immediate response of some kind. The other 16%can be ignored temporarily, or transferred to an action folder where\nthey can be dealt with one at a time.\nStandardize and Delegate\nMy client felt that there was no one who had the ability to sort out his\nemails, more than 300 per day, and that he had to do it all himself, no\nmatter how much time it took. We encouraged him to sit down with\nhis secretary and go through his emails, showing her which ones\nwere important, which ones were unimportant and how to deal with\nthe most common questions and requests.\nTo his surprise, within two hours, his secretary knew enough to\nhandle most of his emails for him. From then on, she would come in\neach morning and delete the 80%of emails that were of no value. She\nwould transfer the essential emails requesting personal action by her\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 100boss into a separate folder. If there were a question on an email, she\nwould transfer it to a “process” folder for him to look at at his\nconvenience.\nAt our next meeting, he told me that he had tracked the time savings\nof this simple exercise and calculated that he was now saving 23\nhours per week of work that he could then spend eating his frogs,\nand getting his most important tasks completed.\nThis simple exercise transformed his life, reduced his stress levels,\nimproved his health and energy and made him a much more relaxed\nand positive person.\nHere is a question for you: “How would your life change if you had\nan extra 23 hours each week, with which to think, work, plan, talk\nwith key coworkers or even go for a walk with your spouse?”\nRefuse to Be a Slave\nA journalist for Fortune magazine wrote recently that, when he\narrived back at the office after a two-week vacation, there were more\nthan 700 emails waiting for him. He realized that it would take him a\nweek to get through them all, during which time he wouldn’t be able\nto tackle any of the projects waiting on his desk.\nFor the first time in his email career, he took a deep breath, and\npunched the “Delete All” button, erasing those 700 emails forever.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 101He then turned and got busy with the projects that were really\nimportant to him and his company.\n His explanation was simple. He said, “I realized that, just because\nsomebody sends me an email, it does not mean that they own a pieceof my life in terms of my having to reply to them, now or ever. In\naddition, it occurred to me that if the email was really important, the\nsender would send it again.” And that’s exactly what happened.\nA Servant, Not a Master\nFor you to be able to concentrate on those few things that make most\nof the difference in your business or personal life, you must discipline\nyourself to use technology as a servant, not a master. Technology is\nthere to help you, not to hinder you. The purpose of technology is to\nmake your life smoother and easier, not to create complexity,confusion and stress.\nOne of the best rules in dealing with time, people and technology is\nto just, “leave things off.” Resist the urge to start turning on\ncommunication devices as soon as you wake up in the morning.\nLeave the radio off. Leave the television off. Leave your cell phone\noff. Leave your computer off until you have planned and organized\nyour day. Deliberately create zones of silence in your life where no\none and nothing can break through and reach you. Maintain your\n“inner calm” by forcing yourself to stop on a regular basis and “listen\nto the silence.”\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 102Sometimes to get more done of higher value, you have to stop doing\nthings of lower value. Keep asking yourself, “What’s important here?”\nWhat is important for you to accomplish at work? What is important\nin your personal life? Of all the things that you could do, if you couldonly do one or two of them, which ones would they be?\nContinuous Contact Is Not Essential\nRemember, when you go away for a day, a week or a month, on\nvacation or on business, if you are out of touch with your\ncommunications devices, nothing happens. The world seems to\ncontinue revolving whether or not you are in continuous contact withit. Problems get solved, answers get found, the work gets done and\nlife continues to flow along like Old Man River. There are very few",

He said, “I realized that, just because\nsomebody sends me an email, it does not mean that they own a pieceof my life in terms of my having to reply to them, now or ever. In\naddition, it occurred to me that if the email was really important, the\nsender would send it again.” And that’s exactly what happened.\nA Servant, Not a Master\nFor you to be able to concentrate on those few things that make most\nof the difference in your business or personal life, you must discipline\nyourself to use technology as a servant, not a master. Technology is\nthere to help you, not to hinder you. The purpose of technology is to\nmake your life smoother and easier, not to create complexity,confusion and stress.\nOne of the best rules in dealing with time, people and technology is\nto just, “leave things off.” Resist the urge to start turning on\ncommunication devices as soon as you wake up in the morning.\nLeave the radio off. Leave the television off. Leave your cell phone\noff. Leave your computer off until you have planned and organized\nyour day. Deliberately create zones of silence in your life where no\none and nothing can break through and reach you. Maintain your\n“inner calm” by forcing yourself to stop on a regular basis and “listen\nto the silence.”\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 102Sometimes to get more done of higher value, you have to stop doing\nthings of lower value. Keep asking yourself, “What’s important here?”\nWhat is important for you to accomplish at work? What is important\nin your personal life? Of all the things that you could do, if you couldonly do one or two of them, which ones would they be?\nContinuous Contact Is Not Essential\nRemember, when you go away for a day, a week or a month, on\nvacation or on business, if you are out of touch with your\ncommunications devices",

The purpose of technology is to\nmake your life smoother and easier, not to create complexity,confusion and stress.\nOne of the best rules in dealing with time, people and technology is\nto just, “leave things off.” Resist the urge to start turning on\ncommunication devices as soon as you wake up in the morning.\nLeave the radio off. Leave the television off. Leave your cell phone\noff. Leave your computer off until you have planned and organized\nyour day. Deliberately create zones of silence in your life where no\none and nothing can break through and reach you.

Problems get solved, answers get found, the work gets done and\nlife continues to flow along like Old Man River. There are very few\nthings that are so important that they cannot wait.\nPeople often ask me at my seminars, “But don’t you have to keep\ncurrent with the news, by reading newspapers, listening to radio and\nwatching television?”\nI tell them, “If it is really important, someone will tell you.” If\nsomething important happens in your life, the country or the world,\nsomeone else can spend hours following the news for you, and they\nwill usually tell you on the first possible occasion.\nMany people discontinue newspapers, stop watching broadcast news\non television and refuse to listen to the radio. And surprisingly\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 103enough, they remain well informed on most important subjects.\nSomeone always keeps them up to date. You should do the same.\nEat That Frog!\n1.  Resolve today to create “zones of silence” during your day-to-day\nactivities. Turn off all communications devices and technology for\none hour in the morning and one hour in the afternoon. You will be\namazed at what happens: nothing!\n2.  Resolve to take one full day off each week during which you do\nnot touch your computer, check your Blackberry or make any\nattempt to keep in touch with the world of technology. At the end of\na day without continuous contact, except by voice, your mind will go\ncalm and clear, like water. By giving your mental batteries time to\nrecharge, free from the incessant interruptions of communication,\nyou will be more relaxed, aware and alert.",

    "text": ", nothing happens. The world seems to\ncontinue revolving whether or not you are in continuous contact withit. Problems get solved, answers get found, the work gets done and\nlife continues to flow along like Old Man River. There are very few\nthings that are so important that they cannot wait.\nPeople often ask me at my seminars, “But don’t you have to keep\ncurrent with the news, by reading newspapers, listening to radio and\nwatching television?”\nI tell them, “If it is really important, someone will tell you.” If\nsomething important happens in your life, the country or the world,\nsomeone else can spend hours following the news for you, and they\nwill usually tell you on the first possible occasion.\nMany people discontinue newspapers, stop watching broadcast news\non television and refuse to listen to the radio. And surprisingly\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 103enough, they remain well informed on most important subjects.\nSomeone always keeps them up to date. You should do the same.\nEat That Frog!\n1.  Resolve today to create “zones of silence” during your day-to-day\nactivities. Turn off all communications devices and technology for\none hour in the morning and one hour in the afternoon. You will be\namazed at what happens: nothing!\n2.  Resolve to take one full day off each week during which you do\nnot touch your computer, check your Blackberry or make any\nattempt to keep in touch with the world of technology. At the end of\na day without continuous contact, except by voice, your mind will go\ncalm and clear, like water. By giving your mental batteries time to\nrecharge, free from the incessant interruptions of communication,\nyou will be more relaxed, aware and alert.",

Problems get solved, answers get found, the work gets done and\nlife continues to flow along like Old Man River. There are very few\nthings that are so important that they cannot wait.\nPeople often ask me at my seminars, “But don’t you have to keep\ncurrent with the news, by reading newspapers, listening to radio and\nwatching television?”\nI tell them, “If it is really important, someone will tell you.” If\nsomething important happens in your life, the country or the world,\nsomeone else can spend hours following the news for you, and they\nwill usually tell you on the first possible occasion.\nMany people discontinue newspapers, stop watching broadcast news\non television and refuse to listen to the radio. And surprisingly\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 103enough, they remain well informed on most important subjects.\nSomeone always keeps them up to date. You should do the same.\nEat That Frog!\n1.  Resolve today to create “zones of silence” during your day-to-day\nactivities. Turn off all communications devices and technology for\none hour in the morning and one hour in the afternoon",
