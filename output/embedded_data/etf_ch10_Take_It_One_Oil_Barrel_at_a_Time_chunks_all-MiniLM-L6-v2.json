One of the best ways to eat a large frog is for\nyou to take it one bite at a time.\nConfucius wrote that, \"A journey of a thousand leagues begins with a\nsingle step.\" This is a great strategy for overcoming procrastination\nand getting more things done faster.\nCrossing a Great Desert\nMany years ago, driving an old Land Rover, I crossed the heart of the\nSahara Desert, the Tenezerouft, deep in modern day Algeria. By that\ntime, the desert had been abandoned by the French for years and the\noriginal refueling stations were empty and shuttered.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 70The desert was 500 miles across in a single stretch, without water,\nfood, a blade of grass or even a fly. It was totally flat, like a broad\nyellow sand parking lot that stretched to the horizon in all directions.\nMore than 1300 people had perished in the crossing of that stretch of\nthe Sahara in previous years. Often drifting sands had obliterated the\ntrack across the desert and the travelers had gotten lost in the night,\nnever to be found again alive.\nTo counter this lack of features in the terrain as you crossed that flat\nwasteland, the French had marked the track with black, 55 gallon oil\ndrums, five kilometers apart, which was exactly the curvature of theearth.\nBecause of this, wherever you were in the daytime, you could see two\noil barrels, the one you had just passed and the one five kilometersahead. And that was all you needed to stay on course.\nAll you had to do was to steer for the next oil barrel. As a result, we\nwere able to cross the biggest desert in the world by simply taking it\n“one oil barrel at a time.”\nTake It One Step at a Time\nIn the same way, you can accomplish the biggest task in your life by\ndisciplining yourself to take it just one step at a time. Your job is to go\nas far as you can see. You will then see far enough to go further.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 71To accomplish a great task, you must step out in faith and have\ncomplete confidence that your next step will soon become clear to\nyou. Remember the wonderful advice, \"Leap — and the net will\nappear!\"\nA great life, a great career is built by performing one task at a time,\nquickly and well, and then going on to the next task.\nFinancial independence is achieved by saving a little money every\nsingle month, year after year. Health and fitness are accomplished by\njust eating a little less and exercising a little more, day after day and\nmonth after month.\nYou can overcome procrastination and accomplish extraordinary\nthings by just taking the first step, by getting started toward your\ngoal and by then taking it one step, one oil barrel at a time.\nEat That Frog!\n1. Select any goal, task or project in your life where you have been\nprocrastinating and make a list of all the steps you will need to take\nto eventually complete the task.\n2. Then take just one step immediately. Sometimes, all you need to do\nto get started is to sit down and complete one item on the list. And\nthen do one more, and so on. You will be amazed at what you\neventually accomplish.",

One of the best ways to eat a large frog is for\nyou to take it one bite at a time.\nConfucius wrote that, \"A journey of a thousand leagues begins with a\nsingle step.\" This is a great strategy for overcoming procrastination\nand getting more things done faster.\nCrossing a Great Desert\nMany years ago, driving an old Land Rover, I crossed the heart of the\nSahara Desert, the Tenezerouft, deep in modern day Algeria. By that\ntime, the desert had been abandoned by the French for years and the\noriginal refueling stations were empty and shuttered.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 70The desert was 500 miles across in a single stretch, without water,\nfood, a blade of grass or even a fly. It was totally flat, like a broad\nyellow sand parking lot that stretched to the horizon in all directions.\nMore than 1300 people had perished in the crossing of that stretch of\nthe Sahara in previous years. Often drifting sands had obliterated the\ntrack across the desert and the travelers had gotten lost in the night,\nnever to be found again alive.\nTo counter this lack of features in the terrain as you crossed that flat\nwasteland, the French had marked the track with black, 55 gallon oil\ndrums, five kilometers apart, which was exactly the curvature of theearth.\nBecause of this, wherever you were in the daytime, you could see two\noil barrels, the one you had just passed and the one five kilometersahead. And that was all you needed to stay on course.\nAll you had to do was to steer for the next oil barrel. As a result, we\nwere able to cross the biggest desert in the world by simply taking it\n“one oil barrel at a time.”\nTake It One Step at a Time\nIn the same way, you can accomplish the biggest task in your",

One of the best ways to eat a large frog is for\nyou to take it one bite at a time.\nConfucius wrote that, \"A journey of a thousand leagues begins with a\nsingle step.\" This is a great strategy for overcoming procrastination\nand getting more things done faster.\nCrossing a Great Desert\nMany years ago, driving an old Land Rover, I crossed the heart of the\nSahara Desert, the Tenezerouft, deep in modern day Algeria. By that\ntime, the desert had been abandoned by the French for years and the\noriginal refueling stations were empty and shuttered.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 70",

By that\ntime, the desert had been abandoned by the French for years and the\noriginal refueling stations were empty and shuttered.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 70The desert was 500 miles across in a single stretch, without water,\nfood, a blade of grass or even a fly. It was totally flat, like a broad\nyellow sand parking lot that stretched to the horizon in all directions.\nMore than 1300 people had perished in the crossing of that stretch of\nthe Sahara in previous years. Often drifting sands had obliterated the\ntrack across the desert and the travelers had gotten lost in the night,\nnever to be found again alive.\nTo counter this lack of features in the terrain as you crossed that flat\nwasteland, the French had marked the track with black, 55 gallon oil\ndrums, five kilometers apart, which was exactly the curvature of theearth.\nBecause of this, wherever you were in the daytime, you could see two\noil barrels, the one you had just passed and the one five kilometersahead. And that was all you needed to stay on course.\nAll you had to do was to steer for the next oil barrel.",
