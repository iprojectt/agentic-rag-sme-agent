    "text": "Organizing: Setting Up the \nRight Buckets \nHAVING A TOTAL and seamless system of organization in place gives \nyou tremendous power because it allows your mind to  let go of \nlower-level thinking and graduate to intuitive focu s- \ning, undistracted by matters that haven't been deal t \nwith appropriately. But your physical organization \nsystem must be better than your mental one in order\nfor that to happen. \nIn this chapter I'll lead you through the organizin g \nsteps and tools that will be required as you proces s your in-basket. As \nyou initially process \"in,\" you'll create lists and  groupings of things \nyou want to organize and you'll invariably think of  additional \nitems to include. In other words, your organization  system is not \n' ' something that you'll necessarily create all at  once, in \na vacuum. It will evolve as you process your stuff and \ntest out whether you have put everything in the bes t \nplace for you. \nThe  outer  ring  of the Workflow Diagram \n(opposite) shows the main groupings into which \nthings will go as you decide what they are and what  needs to be \ndone about them. \n138 \nAirtight organization \nis required for your \nfocus to remain on \nthe broader horizon. \nI got it all together, \nbut I forgot where \nI put it. \n—\nCHAPTER 7  |  ORGANIZING: SETTING UP THE RIGHT BUCKETS \nWORKFLOW DIAGRAM—ORGANIZING \n139 \n\nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  |  PART TWO \nThe Basic Categories \nThere are seven primary types of things that you'll want to keep \n track of and manage from an organizational perspec tive: \n • A \"Projects\" list \n • Project support material \n • Calendared actions and information \n • \"Next Actions\" lists \n• A \"Waiting For\" list \n• Reference material \n• A \"Someday/Maybe\" list \nThe Importance of Hard Edges \nIt's critical that all of these categories be kept pristinely distinct \nfrom one another. They each represent a discrete ty pe of agree- \nment we make with ourselves, and if they lose their  edges and \nbegin to blend, much of the value of organizing wil l be lost. \nIf you put reference materials in the same pile as \nthings you still want to read, for example, you'll go \nnumb to the stack. If you put items on your \"Next \nActions\" lists that really need to go on the calend ar, \nbecause they have to occur on specific days, then y ou \nwon't trust your calendar and you'll continually ha ve to \nreassess your action lists. If you have a project t hat you're \nnot going to be doing anything about for some time,  it must go onto \nyour \"Someday/Maybe\" list so you can relate to the \"Projects\" list \nwith the rigorous action-generating focus it needs.  And if something \nyou're \"Waiting For\" is included on one of your act ion lists, you'll \ncontinually get bogged down by nonproductive rethin king. \nAll You Really Need Is Lists and Folders \nOnce you know what you need to keep track of (covered in the \nprevious chapter, on Processing), all you really need is lists and \n140 The categories must \nbe kept visually, \nphysically, and \npsychologically \nseparate. \nCHAPTER 7  |  ORGANIZING: SETTING UP THE RIGHT BUCKETS \nfolders for reference and support materials. Your l ists \n(which, as I've indicated, could also be items in f old- \ners) will keep track of projects and someday/maybes , \nas well as the actions you'll need to take on your \nactive open loops. Folders (digital or paper-based)\nwill be required to hold your reference material an d \nthe support information for active projects. \nLots of people have been making lists for years \nbut have never found the procedure to be particular ly \neffective. There's rampant skepticism about systems\nas simple as the one I'm recommending. But most \nlist-makers haven't put the appropriate things on \ntheir lists, or have left them incomplete, which ha s kept the lists \nthemselves from being very functional. Once you kno w what goes \non the lists, however, things get much easier; then yo u just need a \nway to manage them. \nAs I've said, you shouldn't bother to create some e xternal \nstructuring of the priorities on your lists that yo u'll then have to \nrearrange or rewrite as things change. Attempting t o impose such \nscaffolding has been a big source of frustration in  many people's \norganizing. You'll be prioritizing more intuitively  as you",

    "text": "Organizing: Setting Up the \nRight Buckets \nHAVING A TOTAL and seamless system of organization in place gives \nyou tremendous power because it allows your mind to  let go of \nlower-level thinking and graduate to intuitive focu s- \ning, undistracted by matters that haven't been deal t \nwith appropriately. But your physical organization \nsystem must be better than your mental one in order\nfor that to happen. \nIn this chapter I'll lead you through the organizin g \nsteps and tools that will be required as you proces s your in-basket. As \nyou initially process \"in,\" you'll create lists and  groupings of things \nyou want to organize and you'll invariably think of  additional \nitems to include. In other words, your organization  system is not \n' ' something that you'll necessarily create all at  once, in \na vacuum. It will evolve as you process your stuff and \ntest out whether you have put everything in the bes t \nplace for you. \nThe  outer  ring  of the Workflow Diagram \n(opposite) shows the main groupings into which \nthings will go as you decide what they are and what  needs to be \ndone about them. \n138 \nAirtight organization \nis required for your \nfocus to remain on \nthe broader horizon. \nI got it all together, \nbut I forgot where \nI put it. \n—\nCHAPTER 7  |  ORGANIZING: SETTING UP THE RIGHT BUCKETS \nWORKFLOW DIAGRAM—ORGANIZING \n139 \n\nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  |  PART TWO \nThe Basic Categories \nThere are seven primary types of things that you'll want to keep \n track of and manage from an organizational perspec tive: \n • A \"Projects\" list \n • Project support material \n • Calendared actions and information \n • \"Next Actions\" lists \n• A \"Waiting For\" list \n• Reference material \n• A \"Someday/Maybe\" list \nThe Importance of Hard Edges \nIt's critical that all of these categories be kept pristinely distinct \nfrom one another. They each represent a discrete ty pe of agree- \nment we make with ourselves, and if they lose their  edges and \nbegin to blend, much of the value of organizing wil l be lost. \nIf you put reference materials in the same pile as \nthings you still want to read, for example, you",

But your physical organization \nsystem must be better than your mental one in order\nfor that to happen. \nIn this chapter I'll lead you through the organizin g \nsteps and tools that will be required as you proces s your in-basket. As \nyou initially process \"in,\" you'll create lists and  groupings of things \nyou want to organize and you'll invariably think of  additional \nitems to include. In other words, your organization  system is not \n' ' something that you'll necessarily create all at  once, in \na vacuum. It will evolve as you process your stuff and \ntest out whether you have put everything in the bes t \nplace for you. \nThe  outer  ring  of the Workflow Diagram \n(opposite) shows the main groupings into which \nthings will go as you decide what they are and what  needs to be \ndone about them. \n138 \nAirt",

If you put items on your \"Next \nActions\" lists that really need to go on the calend ar, \nbecause they have to occur on specific days, then y ou \nwon't trust your calendar and you'll continually ha ve to \nreassess your action lists. If you have a project t hat you're \nnot going to be doing anything about for some time,  it must go onto \nyour \"Someday/Maybe\" list so you can relate to the \"Projects\" list \nwith the rigorous action-generating focus it needs.

There's rampant skepticism about systems\nas simple as the one I'm recommending.

You'll be prioritizing more intuitively  as you see the \nwhole list, against quite a number of shifting vari ables. The list is \njust a way for you to keep track of the total inven tory of active \nthings to which you have made a commitment, and to have that \ninventory available for review. \nWhen I refer to a \"list,\" keep in mind that I mean nothing \nmore than a grouping of items with some similar cha racteristic. A \nlist could look like one of three things: (1) a fil e folder with sepa- \nrate paper notes for the items within the category;  (2) an actual \nlist on a titled piece of paper (often within a loo se-leaf organizer \nor planner); or (3) an inventory in a software prog ram or on a \ndigital assistant, such as Microsoft Outlook task c ategories or a \ncategory on a handheld PDA. \n141 / would not give a \nfig for the \nsimplicity on this \nside of complexity, \nbut I would give \nmy life for the \nsimplicity on the \nother side of \ncomplexity. \n—Oliver Wendell \nHolmes \nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  I  PART TWO \nOrganizing Action Reminders \nIf you've emptied your in-basket, you'll undoubtedl y have created \na stack of \"Pending\" reminders for yourself, repres enting longer- \nthan-two-minute actions that cannot be delegated to  someone \nelse. You'll probably have anywhere from twenty to sixty or sev- \nenty or more such items. You'll also have accumulat ed reminders \nof things that you've handed off to other people, a nd perhaps \nsome things that need be placed in your calendar or  a \"Someday/ \nMaybe\" kind of holder. \nYou'll want to sort all of this into groupings that  make sense \nto you so you can review them as options for work t o do when you \nhave time. You'll also want to decide on the most a ppropriate way \nphysically to organize those groups, whether as ite ms in folders or \non lists, either paper-based or digital. \nThe Actions That Go on Your Calendar \nFor the purposes of organization, as I've said, the re are two basic \nkinds of actions: those that must be done on a cert ain day and/or \nat a particular time, and those that just need to b e done as soon as \nyou can get to them, around your other calendared i tems. Calen- \ndared action items can be either time-specific (e.g ., \"4:00—5:00 \nmeet with Jim\") or day-specific (\"Call Rachel Tuesd ay to see if she \ngot the proposal\"). \nAs you were processing your in-basket, you probably  came \nacross things that you put right into your calendar  as they showed \nup. You may have realized that the next action on \ngetting a medical checkup, for example, was to call\nand make the appointment, and so (since the action \nrequired two minutes or less) you actually did it w hen \nit occurred to you. Writing the appointment into \nyour calendar as you made it would then have been \ncommon sense. \nWhat many people want to do, however, based \n142 The calendar should \nshow only the \"hard \nlandscape\" around \nwhich you do the \nrest of your actions. \nCHAPTER 7  |  ORGANIZING: SETTING UP THE RIGHT BUCKETS \non old habits of writing daily to-do lists, is put actions on the calen- \ndar that they think they'd really like to get done next Monday, say, \nbut that then actually might not, and that might th en have to be \ntaken over to following days. Resist this impulse. You need to trust \nyour calendar as sacred territory, reflecting the e xact hard edges of \nyour day's commitments, which should be noticeable at a glance \nwhile you're on the run. That'll be much easier if the only things in \nthere are those that you absolutely have to get done on that day. \nWhen the calendar is relegated to its proper role i n organizing, the \nmajority of the actions that you need to do are lef t in the category of \n\"as soon as possible, against all the other things I have to do.\" \nOrganizing As-Soon-As-Possible Actions by Context \nOver many years I have discovered that the best way  to be \nreminded of an \"as soon as I can\" action is by the particular context \nrequired for that action—that is,",

You'll be prioritizing more intuitively  as you see the \nwhole list, against quite a number of shifting vari ables. The list is \njust a way for you to keep track of the total inven tory of active \nthings to which you have made a commitment, and to have that \ninventory available for review. \nWhen I refer to a \"list,\" keep in mind that I mean nothing \nmore than a grouping of items with some similar cha racteristic. A \nlist could look like one of three things: (1) a fil e folder with sepa- \nrate paper notes for the items within the category;  (2) an actual \nlist on a titled piece of paper (often within a loo se-leaf organizer \nor planner); or (3) an inventory in a software prog ram or on a \ndigital assistant, such as Microsoft Outlook task c ategories or a \ncategory on a handheld PDA. \n141 / would not give a \nfig for the \nsimplicity on this \nside of complexity, \nbut I would give \nmy life for the \nsimplicity on the \nother side of \ncomplexity. \n—Oliver Wendell \nHolmes \nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  I  PART TWO \nOrganizing Action Reminders \nIf you've emptied your in-basket, you'll undoubtedl y have created \na stack of \"Pending\" reminders for yourself, repres enting longer- \nthan-two-minute actions that cannot be delegated to  someone \nelse. You'll probably have anywhere from twenty to sixty or sev- \nenty or more such items. You'll also have accumulat ed reminders \nof things that you've handed off to other people, a nd perhaps \nsome things that need be placed in your calendar or  a \"Someday/ \nMaybe\" kind of holder. \nYou'll want to sort all of this into groupings that  make sense \nto you so you can review them as options for work t o do when you \nhave time. You'll also want to decide on the most a ppropriate way \nphysically to organize those groups, whether as ite ms in folders or \non lists, either paper-based or digital. \nThe Actions That Go on",

A \nlist could look like one of three things: (1) a fil e folder with sepa- \nrate paper notes for the items within the category;  (2) an actual \nlist on a titled piece of paper (often within a loo se-leaf organizer \nor planner); or (3) an inventory in a software prog ram or on a \ndigital assistant, such as Microsoft Outlook task c ategories or a \ncategory on a handheld PDA. \n141 / would not give a \nfig for the \nsimplicity on this \nside of complexity",

You'll also want to decide on the most a ppropriate way \nphysically to organize those groups, whether as ite ms in folders or \non lists, either paper-based or digital. \nThe Actions That Go on Your Calendar \nFor the purposes of organization, as I've said, the re are two basic \nkinds of actions: those that must be done on a cert ain day and/or \nat a particular time, and those that just need to b e done as soon as \nyou can get to them, around your other calendared i tems. Calen- \ndared action items can be either time-specific (e.g ., \"4:00—5:00 \nmeet with Jim\") or day-specific (\"Call Rachel Tuesd ay to see if she \ngot the proposal\"). \nAs you were processing your in-basket, you probably  came \nacross things that you put right into your calendar  as they showed \nup. You may have realized that the next action on \ngetting a medical checkup, for example, was to call\nand make the appointment, and so (since the action \nrequired two minutes or less) you actually did it w hen \nit occurred to you. Writing the appointment into \nyour calendar as you made it would then have been \ncommon sense. \nWhat many people want to do, however, based \n142 The calendar should \nshow only the \"hard \nlandscape\" around \nwhich you do the \nrest of your actions. \nCHAPTER 7  |  ORGANIZING: SETTING UP THE RIGHT BUCKETS \non old habits of writing daily to-do lists, is put actions on the calen- \ndar that they think they'd really like to get done next Monday, say, \nbut that then actually might not, and that might th en have to be \ntaken over to following days. Resist this impulse. You need to trust \nyour calendar as sacred territory, reflecting the e xact hard edges of \nyour day's commitments, which should be noticeable at a glance \nwhile you're on the run. That'll be much easier if the only things in \nthere are those that you absolutely have to get done on that day. \nWhen the calendar is relegated to its proper role i n organizing, the \nmajority of the actions that you need to do are lef t in the category of \n\"as soon as possible, against all the other things I have to do.\" \nOrganizing",

    "text": " As-Soon-As-Possible Actions by Context \nOver many years I have discovered that the best way  to be \nreminded of an \"as soon as I can\" action is by the particular context \nrequired for that action—that is, either the tool o r the location or \nthe person needed to complete it. For instance, if the action requires \na computer, it should go on an \"At Computer\" list. If your action \ndemands that you be out in your car driving around (such as stop- \nping by the bank or going to the hardware store), t he \"Errands\" list \nwould be the appropriate place to track it. If the next step is to talk \nabout something face-to-face with your partner Emil y, putting it \ninto an \"Emily\" folder or list makes the most sense . \nHow discrete these categories will need to be will depend on \n(1) how many actions you actually have to track; an d (2) how \noften you change the contexts within which to do th em. \nIf you are that rare person who has only twenty-fiv e next \nactions, a single \"Next Actions\" list might suffice . It could include \nitems as diverse as \"Buy nails\" and \"Talk to boss a bout staff \nchanges\" and \"Draft ideas about off-site meeting.\" If, however, \nyou have fifty or a hundred next actions pending, k eeping all of \nthose on one big list would make it too difficult t o see what you \nneeded to see; each time you got any window of time  to do some- \nthing, you'd have to do unproductive resorting. If you happened to \nbe on a short break at a conference, during which y ou might be \n143 \n144 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY I  PART TWO \nable to make some calls, you'd have to identify the  items that were \ncalls among a big batch of unrelated items. When yo u went out to \ndo odds and ends, you'd probably want to pick out y our errands \nand make another list. \nAnother productivity factor that this kind of organ ization \nsupports is leveraging your energy when you're in a  certain mode. \nWhen you're in \"phone mode,\" it helps to make a lot  of phone \ncalls—just crank down your \"Calls\" list. When your computer is up \nand running and you're cruising along digitally, it 's useful to get as \nmuch done on-line as you can without having to shif t into another \nkind of activity. It takes more energy than most pe ople realize to \nunhook out of one set of behaviors and get into ano ther kind of \nrhythm and tool set. And obviously, when a key pers on is sitting in \nfront of you in your office, you'd be wise to have all the things you \nneed to talk about with him or her immediately at h and. \nThe Most Common Categories of Action Reminders \nYou'll probably find that at least a few of the fol lowing common \nlist headings for next actions will make sense for you: \n• \"Calls\" \n• \"At Computer\" \n•\"Errand's\" \n• \"Office Actions\" or \"At Office\" (miscellaneous) \n• \"At Home\" \n• \"Agendas\" (for people and meetings) \n• \"Read/Review\" \n\"Calls\" This is the list of all the phone calls you need to  make; \nyou can work off it as long as you have a phone ava ilable. The \nmore mobile you are (especially if you have a cell phone), the \nmore useful you'll find it to have one single list of all your calls: \nthose strange little windows of time that you wind up with when \nyou're off-site or traveling—on a break or waiting for a plane, \nmaybe—offer a perfect opportunity to work down your  list. Hav- \nCHAPTER 7  |  ORGANIZING: SETTING UP THE RIGHT BUCKETS \ning a discrete \"Calls\" list makes it much easier to  focus and intu- \nitively pick the best call to make in the moment. \nI -suggest that you take the time to write the phon e number \nitself alongside each item. There are many situatio ns in which you \nwould probably make the call if the number was alre ady there in \nfront of you but not if you had to look it up. \n\"At Computer\" If you work with a computer—particularly if you \nmove around with a laptop or have a PC at work and another one \nat home—it can be helpful to group all those action s that you \nneed to do when it's on and running. This will allo w you to see all \nyour options for computer work to do, reminding you  of all the \ne-mails you need to send, the documents",

    "text": " As-Soon-As-Possible Actions by Context \nOver many years I have discovered that the best way  to be \nreminded of an \"as soon as I can\" action is by the particular context \nrequired for that action—that is, either the tool o r the location or \nthe person needed to complete it. For instance, if the action requires \na computer, it should go on an \"At Computer\" list. If your action \ndemands that you be out in your car driving around (such as stop- \nping by the bank or going to the hardware store), t he \"Errands\" list \nwould be the appropriate place to track it. If the next step is to talk \nabout something face-to-face with your partner Emil y, putting it \ninto an \"Emily\" folder or list makes the most sense . \nHow discrete these categories will need to be will depend on \n(1) how many actions you actually have to track; an d (2) how \noften you change the contexts within which to do th em. \nIf you are that rare person who has only twenty-fiv e next \nactions, a single \"Next Actions\" list might suffice . It could include \nitems as diverse as \"Buy nails\" and \"Talk to boss a bout staff \nchanges\" and \"Draft ideas about off-site meeting.\" If, however, \nyou have fifty or a hundred next actions pending, k eeping all of \nthose on one big list would make it too difficult t o see what you \nneeded to see; each time you got any window of time  to do some- \nthing, you'd have to do unproductive resorting. If you happened to \nbe on a short break at a conference, during which y ou might be \n143 \n144 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY I  PART TWO \nable to make some calls, you'd have to identify the  items that were \ncalls among a big batch of unrelated items. When yo u went out to \ndo odds and ends, you'd probably want to pick out y our errands \nand make another list. \nAnother productivity factor that this kind of organ ization \nsupports is leveraging your energy when you're in a  certain mode. \nWhen you're in \"phone mode,\" it helps to make a lot  of phone \ncalls—just crank down your \"Calls\" list. When your computer is up \nand running and you're cruising along digitally, it 's useful",

    "text": " As-Soon-As-Possible Actions by Context \nOver many years I have discovered that the best way  to be \nreminded of an \"as soon as I can\" action is by the particular context \nrequired for that action—that is, either the tool o r the location or \nthe person needed to complete it. For instance, if the action requires \na computer, it should go on an \"At Computer\" list. If your action \ndemands that you be out in your car driving around (such as stop- \nping by the bank or going to the hardware store), t he \"Errands\" list \nwould be the appropriate place to track it. If the next step is to talk \nabout something face-to-face with your partner Emil y, putting it \ninto an \"Emily\" folder or list makes the most sense . \nHow discrete these categories will need to be will depend on \n(1) how many actions you actually have to track; an d (2) how \noften you change the contexts within which to do th em. \nIf you are that rare person who has only twenty-fiv e next \nactions, a single \"Next Actions\" list might suffice . It could include \nitems as diverse as \"Buy nails\"",

This will allo w you to see all \nyour options for computer work to do, reminding you  of all the \ne-mails you need to send, the documents you need to  draft or edit, \nand so on. \nBecause I fly a lot, I even maintain an \"On- \nline\" action list, separate from my \"At Computer\" \none. When I'm on a plane, I can't easily connect to\nthe Web or to my server, as many actions require. S o \ninstead of having to rethink what I can and can't d o \nwhenever I look at my \"At Computer\" list, I can tru st \nthat none of my \"At Computer\" actions require that I \nbe connected, which frees my mind to make choices \nbased on other criteria. \nIf you have a computer only at work, you may \nnot need a separate \"At Computer\" list; \"Office Act ions\" may \ncover those actions because the office is the only place you can do \nthem anyway. (Similarly, if you have a computer onl y at home, \nand it's not a laptop, you may be able to put compu ter-specific \nactions on your \"At Home\" list.) \n\"Errands\" It makes a lot of sense to group together in one pl ace \nreminders of all the things you need to do when you 're \"out and \nabout.\" When you know you need to get in your car a nd go some- \nwhere, it's great to be able to look at the list wh ile you're on the \nroad. Actions like \"Get stock certificates from saf ety-deposit box,\" \n145 Think carefully \nabout where and \nhowyou can and \ncan't do which \nactions, and \norganize your lists \naccordingly.\nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY |  PART TWO \n\"Pick up pictures at framers,\" and \"Buy petunias at  nursery\" would \nall go here. \nThis list could, of course, be nothing more elabora te than a \nPost-it that you keep in your planner somewhere, or  a screen in an \n\"Errands\" category of the \"To Do\" section on your P alm orga- \nnizer. \nIt's often helpful to track sublists within individ ual \n\"Errands\" items. For instance, as soon as you reali ze you need \nsomething from the hardware store, you might want t o make \n\"Hardware Store\" the list item and then append a su blist of all the \nthings you want to pick up there, as you think of t hem. On the \nlow-tech end, you could create a \"Hardware Store\" P ost-it; on \nthe high-tech side, if you were using a digital lis t, you \ncould attach a \"note\" to \"Hardware Store\" on your l ist \nand input the details there. \nBecause I travel in major metropolitan areas so \nmuch, I keep two \"Errands\" lists—\"Errands—Ojai\" \n(where I live) and \"Errands—Anywhere,\" for all \nthose other things I can pick up even when I'm on \nthe road. \"T-connectors for irrigation\" would go on\n\"Errands—\nOjai,\" but \"Get dress socks\" would go on \"Errands—A nywhere.\" \n\"Office Actions'/\"At Office\" If you work in an office, there will be \ncertain things that you can do only there, and a li st of those will \nbe a useful thing to have in front of you then—thou gh obviously, \nif \nyou have a phone and a computer in your office, and  you have \n\"Calls\" and \"At Computer\" as separate lists, they'll be in play as \nwell. I'd use an \"Office Actions\" or \"At Office\" li st for anything that \nrequired an Internet connection available only, or even most con- \nveniently, in the office—for example, a reminder to  download a \nlarge software program from the Web would go on thi s list for me. \n\"At Home\" Many actions can be done only at home, and it makes\nsense to keep a list specific to that context. I'm sure you've got \nnumerous personal and around-the-house projects, an d often the \n146 We must strive to \nreach that \nsimplicity that lies \nbeyond \nsophistication. \n—-John Gardner \nCHAPTER 7  I  ORGANIZING: SETTING UP THE RIGHT BUCKETS \nnext thing to do on them is just to do them. \"Hang new print,\" \n\"Organize CDs,\" and \"Switch closets to winter cloth es\" would be \ntypical items for this grouping. \nIf you have",

    "text": " a screen in an \n\"Errands\" category of the \"To Do\" section on your P alm orga- \nnizer. \nIt's often helpful to track sublists within individ ual \n\"Errands\" items. For instance, as soon as you reali ze you need \nsomething from the hardware store, you might want t o make \n\"Hardware Store\" the list item and then append a su blist of all the \nthings you want to pick up there, as you think of t hem. On the \nlow-tech end, you could create a \"Hardware Store\" P ost-it; on \nthe high-tech side, if you were using a digital lis t, you \ncould attach a \"note\" to \"Hardware Store\" on your l ist \nand input the details there. \nBecause I travel in major metropolitan areas so \nmuch, I keep two \"Errands\" lists—\"Errands—Ojai\" \n(where I live) and \"Errands—Anywhere,\" for all \nthose other things I can pick up even when I'm on \nthe road. \"T-connectors for irrigation\" would go on\n\"Errands—\nOjai,\" but \"Get dress socks\" would go on \"Errands—A nywhere.\" \n\"Office Actions'/\"At Office\" If you work in an office, there will be \ncertain things that you can do only there, and a li st of those will \nbe a useful thing to have in front of you then—thou gh obviously, \nif \nyou have a phone and a computer in your office, and  you have \n\"Calls\" and \"At Computer\" as separate lists, they'll be in play as \nwell. I'd use an \"Office Actions\" or \"At Office\" li st for anything that \nrequired an Internet connection available only, or even most con- \nveniently, in the office—for example, a reminder to  download a \nlarge software program from the Web would go on thi s list for me. \n\"At Home\" Many actions can be done only at home, and it makes\nsense to keep a list specific to that context. I'm sure you've got \nnumerous personal and around-the-house projects, an d often the \n146 We must strive to \nreach that \nsimplicity that lies \nbeyond \nsophistication. \n—-John Gardner \nCHAPTER 7  I  ORGANIZING: SETTING UP THE RIGHT",

    "text": " BUCKETS \nnext thing to do on them is just to do them. \"Hang new print,\" \n\"Organize CDs,\" and \"Switch closets to winter cloth es\" would be \ntypical items for this grouping. \nIf you have an office at home, as I do, anything th at can be \ndone only there goes on the \"At Home\" list. (If you  work only at \nhome and don't go to another office, you won't need  an \"Office \nActions\" list at all—the \"At Home\" list will suffic e.) \n\"Agendas\"   Invariably you'll find that many of your next actio ns \nneed to either occur in a real-time interaction wit h someone or be \nbrought up in a committee, team, or staff meeting. \nYou have to talk to your partner about an idea for \nnext year; you want to check with your spouse about\nhis schedule for the spring; you need to delegate a\ntask to your secretary that's too complicated to \nexplain  in  an  e-mail.  And  you  must  make  an \nannouncement at the Monday staff meeting about \nthe change in expense-report policies. \nThese next actions should be put on separate \n\"Agenda\" lists for each of those people and for tha t meeting (assum- \ning that you attend it regularly). Professionals wh o keep a file folder \nto hold all the things they need to go over with th eir boss already \nuse a version of this method. If you're conscientio us about deter- \nmining all your next actions, though, you may find that you'll \nneed somewhere between three and fifteen of these k inds of lists. I \nrecommend that separate files or lists be kept for bosses, partners, \nassistants, spouses, and children. You should also keep the same kind \nof list for your attorney, financial adviser, accou ntant, and/or com- \nputer consultant, as well as for anyone else with w hom you might \nhave more than one thing to go over the next time y ou talk on the \nphone. \nIf you participate in standing meetings—staff meeti ngs, \nproject meetings, board meetings, committee meeting s, what- \never—they, too, deserve their own files, in which y ou can collect \nthings that will need to be addressed on those occa sions. \n147 Standing meetings \nand people you deal\nwith on an ongoing \nbasis may need \ntheir own \"Agenda\" \nlists.\n148 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  |  PART TWO \nOften you'll want to keep a running list of things to go over \nwith someone you'll be interacting with only for a limited period \nof time. For instance, if you have a contractor doi ng a significant \npiece of work on your house or property, you can cr eate a list for \nhim for the duration of the project. As you're walk ing around the \nsite after he's left for the day, you may notice se veral things you \nneed to talk with him about, and you'll want that l ist to be easy to \ncapture and to access as needed. \nGiven the usefulness of this type of list, your sys tem should \nallow you to add \"Agendas\" ad hoc, as needed, quick ly and simply. \nFor example, inserting a page for a person or a mee ting within an \n\"Agenda\" section in a loose-leaf notebook planner t akes only seconds, \nas does adding a dedicated \"Memo\" in a PDA's \"Agend a\" category. \n\"Read/Review\" You will no doubt have discovered in your in- \nbasket a number of things for which your next actio n is to read. I\nhope you will have held to the two-minute rule and dispatched a \nnumber of those quick-skim items already—tossing, f iling, or \nrouting them forward as appropriate. \nTo-read items that you know will demand more than t wo \nminutes of your time are usually best managed in a separate physi- \ncal stack-basket labeled \"Read/Review.\" This is sti ll a \"list\" by my \ndefinition, but one that's more efficiently dealt w ith by group- \ning the documents and magazines themselves in a tra y and/or \nportable folder. \nFor many people, the \"Read/Review\" stack can get qu ite \nlarge. That's why it's critical that the pile be re served only for \nthose longer-than-two-minute things that you actual ly want to \nread when you have time. That can be daunting enough in itself, \nbut things get seriously out of control and psychologically numb- \ning when the edges of this category are not clearly  defined. A \npristine delineation will at least make you conscio us of the inven- \ntory",

(If you  work only at \nhome and don't go to another office, you won't need  an \"Office \nActions\" list at all—the \"At Home\" list will suffic e.) \n\"Agendas\"   Invariably you'll find that many of your next actio ns \nneed to either occur in a real-time interaction wit h someone or be \nbrought up in a committee, team, or staff meeting. \nYou have to talk to your partner about an idea for \nnext year; you want to check with your spouse about\nhis schedule for the spring; you need to delegate a\ntask to your secretary that's too complicated to \nexplain  in  an  e-mail.  And  you  must  make  an \nannouncement at the Monday staff meeting about \nthe change in expense-report policies. \nThese next actions should be put on separate \n\"Agenda\" lists for each of those people and for tha t meeting (assum- \ning that you attend it regularly). Professionals wh o keep a file folder \nto hold all the things they need to go over with th eir boss already \nuse a version of this method. If you're conscientio us about deter- \nmining all your next actions, though, you may find that you'll \nneed somewhere between three and fifteen of these k inds of lists. I \nrecommend that separate files or lists be kept for bosses, partners, \nassistants, spouses, and children. You should also keep the same kind \nof list for your attorney, financial adviser, accou ntant, and/or com- \nputer consultant, as well as for anyone else with w hom you might \nhave more than one thing to go over the next time y ou talk on the \nphone. \nIf you participate in standing meetings—staff meeti ngs, \nproject meetings, board meetings, committee meeting s, what- \never—they, too, deserve their own files, in which y ou can collect \nthings that will need to be addressed on those occa sions. \n147 Standing meetings \nand people you deal\nwith",

For instance, if you have a contractor doi ng a significant \npiece of work on your house or property, you can cr eate a list for \nhim for the duration of the project. As you're walk ing around the \nsite after he's left for the day, you may notice se veral things you \nneed to talk with him about, and you'll want that l ist to be easy to \ncapture and to access as needed. \nGiven the usefulness of this type of list, your sys tem should \nallow you to add \"Agendas\" ad hoc, as needed, quick ly and simply. \nFor example, inserting a page for a person or a mee ting within an \n\"Agenda\" section in a loose-leaf notebook planner t akes only seconds, \nas does adding a dedicated \"Memo\" in a PDA's \"Agend a\" category. \n\"Read/Review\" You will no doubt have discovered in your in- \nbasket a number of things for which your next actio n is to read. I\nhope you will have held to the two-minute rule and dispatched a \nnumber of those quick-skim items already—tossing, f iling, or \nrouting them forward as appropriate. \nTo-read items that you know will demand more than t wo \nminutes of your time are usually best managed in a separate physi- \ncal stack-basket labeled \"Read/Review.\" This is sti ll a \"list\" by my \ndefinition, but one that's more efficiently dealt w ith by group- \ning the documents and magazines themselves in a tra y and/or \nportable folder. \nFor many people, the \"Read/Review\" stack can get qu ite \nlarge. That's why it's critical that the pile be re served only for \nthose longer-than-two-minute things that you actual ly want to \nread when you have time. That can be daunting enough in",

    "text": " itself, \nbut things get seriously out of control and psychologically numb- \ning when the edges of this category are not clearly  defined. A \npristine delineation will at least make you conscio us of the inven- \ntory, and if you're like most people, having some t ype of self- \nregulating mechanism will help you become more awar e of what \nyou want to keep and what you should just get rid o f. \nCHAPTER 7  |  ORGANIZING: SETTING UP THE RIGHT BUCKETS \nIt's practical to have that stack of reading materi al at hand \nand easy to grab on the run when you're on your way  to a meeting \nthat may be late starting, a seminar that may have a \nwindow of time when nothing is going on, or a den- \ntist appointment that may keep you waiting to get \nyour teeth cleaned. Those are all great opportuniti es \nto crank through that kind of reading. People who \ndon't have their \"Read/Review\" material organized \ncan waste a lot of time, since life is full of weir d little \nwindows when it could be processed. \nOrganizing \"Waiting For\" \nLike reminders of the actions you need to do, reminders of all \nthe things that you're waiting to get back from or get done by \nothers have to be sorted and grouped. You won't nec essarily be \ntracking discrete action steps here, but more often  final deliver- \nables or projects that others are responsible for, such as the tickets \nyou've ordered from the theater, the scanner that's  coming for \nthe office, the OK on the proposal from your client , and so \non. When the next action on something is up to some one else, \nyou don't need an action reminder, just a trigger about what \nyou're waiting for from whom. Your role is to revie w that list as \noften as you need to and assess whether you ought t o be taking \nan action such as checking the status or lighting a  fire under the \nproject. \nYou'll probably find it works best to keep this \"Wa iting For\" \nlist close at hand, in the same system as your own \"Next Actions\" \nreminder lists. The responsibility for the next ste p may bounce \nback and forth many times before a project is finis hed. For exam- \nple, you may need to make a call to a vendor to req uest a proposal \nfor a piece of work (on your \"Calls\" list.) Having made the call, \nyou then wait for the vendor to get back to you wit h the proposal \n(the proposal goes to your \"Waiting For\" list). Whe n the propo- \nsal comes in, you have to review it (it lands in yo ur \"Read/Review\" \nstack-basket). Once you've gone over it, you send i t to your boss \n149 Those who make \nthe worst use of \ntheir time are the \nfirst to complain of \nits shortness. \n—-Jean \nde \nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY |  PART TWO \nfor her approval (now it's back on your \"Waiting Fo r\" list). And \nso on.* \nYou'll get a great feeling when you know that your \"Waiting \nFor\" list is the complete inventory of everything y ou care about \nthat other people are supposed to be doing. \nUsing the Original Item as Its Own Action Reminder \nThe most efficient way to track your action reminde rs is to add \nthem to lists or folders as they occur to you. The originating trig- \nger won't be needed after you have processed it. Yo u \nmight take notes in the meeting with your boss, but\nyou can toss those after you've pulled out any proj ects \nand actions associated with them. While some peo- \nple try to archive voice-mails that they still need\nto \"do something about,\" that's not the most effec-\ntive way to manage the reminders embedded in them. \nThere are some exceptions to this rule, however. Ce rtain \nkinds of input will most efficiently serve as their  own reminders of \nrequired actions, rather than your having to write something \nabout them on a list. This is particularly true for  some paper- \nbased materials and some e-mails. \nManaging Paper-Based Workflow \nSome things are their own best reminders of work to  be done. The \ncategory of \"Read/Review\" articles, publications, a nd documents \nis the most common example. It would obviously be o verkill to \nwrite \"Review Fortune magazine\" on some action list when you \ncould just as easily toss the magazine itself into your \"Read/ \nReview\" basket to act as the trigger. \n150 *Digital list managers (like the Palm's) or low-tec h papers in separate folders \n",

A \npristine delineation will at least make you conscio us of the inven- \ntory, and if you're like most people, having some t ype of self- \nregulating mechanism will help you become more awar e of what \nyou want to keep and what you should just get rid o f. \nCHAPTER 7  |  ORGANIZING: SETTING UP THE RIGHT BUCKETS \nIt's practical to have that stack of reading materi al at hand \nand easy to grab on the run when you're on your way  to a meeting \nthat may be late starting, a seminar that may have a \nwindow of time when nothing is going on, or a den- \ntist appointment that may keep you waiting to get \nyour teeth cleaned. Those are all great opportuniti es \nto crank through that kind of reading. People who \ndon't have their \"Read/Review\" material organized \ncan waste a lot of time, since life is full of weir d little \nwindows when it could be processed. \nOrganizing \"Waiting For\" \nLike reminders of the actions you need to do, reminders of all \nthe things that you're waiting to get back from or get done by \nothers have to be sorted and grouped. You won't nec essarily be \ntracking discrete action steps here, but more often  final deliver- \nables or projects that others are responsible for, such as the tickets \nyou've ordered from the theater, the scanner that's  coming for \nthe office, the OK on the proposal from your client , and so \non. When the next action on something is up to some one else, \nyou don't need an action reminder, just a trigger about what \nyou're waiting for from whom. Your role is to revie w that list as \noften as you need to and assess whether you ought t o be taking \nan action such as checking the status or lighting a  fire under the \nproject. \nYou'll probably find it works best to keep this \"Wa iting For\" \nlist close at hand, in the same system as your own \"Next Actions\" \nreminder lists. The responsibility for the next ste p may bounce \nback and forth many times before a project is finis hed. For exam- \nple, you may need to make a call",

People who \ndon't have their \"Read/Review\" material organized \ncan waste a lot of time, since life is full of weir d little \nwindows when it could be processed. \nOrganizing \"Waiting For\" \nLike reminders of the actions you need to do, reminders of all \nthe things that you're waiting to get back from or get done by \nothers have to be sorted and grouped. You won't nec essarily be \ntracking discrete action steps here, but more often  final deliver- \nables or projects that others are responsible for, such as the tickets \nyou've ordered from the theater, the scanner that's  coming for \nthe office, the OK on the proposal from your client , and so \non. When the next action on something is up to some one else, \nyou don't need an action reminder, just a trigger about what \nyou're waiting for from whom. Your role is to revie w that list as \noften as you need to and assess whether you ought t o be taking \nan action such as checking the status or lighting a  fire under the \nproject. \nYou'll probably find it works best to keep this \"Wa iting For\" \nlist close at hand, in",

Having made the call, \nyou then wait for the vendor to get back to you wit h the proposal \n(the proposal goes to your \"Waiting For\" list).

The originating trig- \nger won't be needed after you have processed it. Yo u \nmight take notes in the meeting with your boss, but\nyou can toss those after you've pulled out any proj ects \nand actions associated with them. While some peo- \nple try to archive voice-mails that they still need\nto \"do something about,\" that's not the most effec-\ntive way to manage the reminders embedded in them. \nThere are some exceptions to this rule, however. Ce rtain \nkinds of input will most efficiently serve as their  own reminders of \nrequired actions, rather than your having to write something \nabout them on a list. This is particularly true for  some paper- \nbased materials and some e-mails. \nManaging Paper-Based Workflow \nSome things are their own best reminders of work to  be done.

    "text": " action list when you \ncould just as easily toss the magazine itself into your \"Read/ \nReview\" basket to act as the trigger. \n150 *Digital list managers (like the Palm's) or low-tec h papers in separate folders \nhave an advantage, here over lists on paper because  they let you easily move an \nitem from one category to another as the action cha nges, without your having \nto rewrite anything. Keep actionable \ne-mails and paper \nseparated from all\nthe rest. \nCHAPTER 7  I  ORGANIZING: SETTING UP THE RIGHT BUCKETS \nAnother example: people who find it easier to deal with bills \nby paying them all at one time and in one location will want to \nkeep their bills in a folder or stack-basket labele d \"Bills to Pay\" \n(or, more generically, \"Financial to Process\"). Sim ilarly, receipts \nfor expense reporting should be either dealt with a t the time \nthey're generated or kept in their own \"Receipts to  Process\" enve- \nlope or folder.* \nThe specific nature of your work, your input, and y our work- \nstation may make it more efficient to organize othe r categories \nusing only the original paper itself. A customer-se rvice profes- \nsional, for instance, may deal with numerous reques ts that show \nup in a standard written form, and in that case mai ntaining a bas- \nket or file containing only those actionable items is the best way to \nmanage them. \nWhether it makes more sense to write reminders on a  list or \nto use the originating documents in a basket or fol der will depend \nto a great extent on logistics. Could you use those  reminders \nsomewhere other than at your desk? If so, the porta bility of the \nmaterial should be considered. If you couldn't poss ibly do that \nwork anywhere but at your desk, then managing remin ders of it \nsolely at your workstation is the better choice. \nWhichever option you select, the reminders should b e in \nvisibly discrete categories based upon the next act ion required. If \nthe next action on a service order is to make a cal l, it should be in \na \"Calls\" group; if the action step is to review in formation and \ninput it into the computer, it should be labeled \"A t Computer.\" \nMost undermining of the effectiveness of many workf low systems \nI see is the fact that all the documents of one typ e (e.g., service \nrequests) are kept in a single tray, even though di fferent kinds of \nactions may be required on each one. One request ne eds a phone \n*This approach can be dangerous, however, if you do n't put those \"Bills to Pay\" \nor \"Receipts to Process\" in front of your face as c onsistently as you should. Just \nhaving them \"organized\" isn't sufficient to get the m off your mind—you've also \ngot to review them appropriately. \n151 \n152 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  |  PART TWO \ncall, another needs data reviewed, and still anothe r is waiting for \nsomeone to get back with some information—but they' re all \nsorted together. This arrangement can cause a perso n's mind to \ngo numb to the stack because of all the decisions t hat are still \npending about the next-action level of doing. \nMy personal system is highly portable, with almost every- \nthing kept on lists, but I still maintain two categ ories of paper- \nbased reminders. I travel with a \"Read/Review\" plas tic file folder \nand another one labeled \"Data Entry.\" In the latter  I put anything \nfor which the next action is simply to input data i nto my com- \nputer (business cards that need to get into my tele phone/address \nlist, quotes for my \"Quotes\" database, articles abo ut restaurants I \nwant to put on my \"Travel—Cities\" sublists, etc.). \nManaging E-mail-Based Workflow \nLike some paper-based materials, e-mails that need action are \nsometimes best as their own reminders—in this case within the \ntracked e-mail system itself. This is especially li kely to be true if \nyou get a lot of e-mail and spend a lot of your wor k time with your \ne-mail software booted up. E-mails that you need to  act on may \nthen be stored within the system instead of having their embed- \nded actions written out on a list. \nMany of my clients have found it helpful to set up two or \nthree unique folders on their e-mail navigator bars . True, most \nfolders in e-mail should be used for reference or a rchived materi- \nals, but it's also possible to set up a workable sy stem that",

Keep actionable \ne-mails and paper \nseparated from all\nthe rest. \nCHAPTER 7  I  ORGANIZING: SETTING UP THE RIGHT BUCKETS \nAnother example: people who find it easier to deal with bills \nby paying them all at one time and in one location will want to \nkeep their bills in a folder or stack-basket labele d \"Bills to Pay\" \n(or, more generically, \"Financial to Process\"). Sim ilarly, receipts \nfor expense reporting should be either dealt with a t the time \nthey're generated or kept in their own \"Receipts to  Process\" enve- \nlope or folder.* \nThe specific nature of your work, your input, and y our work- \nstation may make it more efficient to organize othe r categories \nusing only the original paper itself. A customer-se rvice profes- \nsional, for instance, may deal with numerous reques ts that show \nup in a standard written form, and in that case mai ntaining a bas- \nket or file containing only those actionable items is the best way to \nmanage them. \nWhether it makes more sense to write reminders on a  list or \nto use the originating documents in a basket or fol der will depend \nto a great extent on logistics. Could you use those  reminders \nsomewhere other than at your desk? If so, the porta bility of the \nmaterial should be considered. If you couldn't poss ibly do that \nwork anywhere but at your desk, then managing remin ders of it \nsolely at your workstation is the better choice. \nWhichever option you select, the reminders should b e in \nvisibly discrete categories based upon the next act ion required. If \nthe next action on a service order is to make a cal l, it should be in \na \"Calls\" group; if the action step is to review in formation and \ninput it into the computer, it should be labeled \"A t Computer.\" \nMost undermining of the effectiveness of many",

This arrangement can cause a perso n's mind to \ngo numb to the stack because of all the decisions t hat are still \npending about the next-action level of doing. \nMy personal system is highly portable, with almost every- \nthing kept on lists, but I still maintain two categ ories of paper- \nbased reminders. I travel with a \"Read/Review\" plas tic file folder \nand another one labeled \"Data Entry.\" In the latter  I put anything \nfor which the next action is simply to input data i nto my com- \nputer (business cards that need to get into my tele phone/address \nlist, quotes for my \"Quotes\" database, articles abo ut restaurants I \nwant to put on my \"Travel—Cities\" sublists, etc.). \nManaging E-mail-Based Workflow \nLike some paper-based materials, e-mails that need action are \nsometimes best as their own reminders—in this case within the \ntracked e-mail system itself.

True, most \nfolders in e-mail should be used for reference or a rchived materi- \nals, but it's also possible to set up a workable sy stem that will keep \nyour actionable messages discretely organized, outs ide of the \"in\" \narea itself (which is where most people keep them).\nI recommend that you create one folder for any long er-than- \ntwo-minute e-mails that you need to act on (again, you should be \nable to dispatch many messages right off the bat by  following the \ntwo-minute rule). The folder name should begin with  a prefix let- \nter or symbol so that (1) it looks different from y our reference \nfolders and (2) it sits at the top of your folders in the navigator bar. \nUse something like the \"@\" sign in Microsoft or the  dash (\"-\") in \nCHAPTER 7 |  ORGANIZING: SETTING UP THE RIGHT BUCKETS \nLotus, which sort into their systems at the top. Yo ur resulting \n\"FACTION\" folder will hold those e-mails that you n eed to do \nsomething about. \nNext you can create a folder titled \"@WAITING FOR,\"\nwhich will show up in the same place as the \"@ACTIO N\" folder. \nThen, as you receive e-mails that indicate that som eone is going \nto do something that you care about tracking, you c an drag them \nover into the \"@WAITING FOR\" file. It can also hold  reminders \nfor anything that you delegate via e-mail: when you  forward \nsomething, or use e-mail to make a request or deleg ate an action, \njust save a copy into the \"@WAITING FOR\" file.* \nSome applications (such as Lotus Notes) allow you t o file a \ncopy of an e-mail into one of your folders as you s end it (with a \n\"Send and File\" button). Others (e.g., Outlook) wil l simultane- \nously save only into your universal \"Sent Mail\" fol der. In the latter \ncase, what seems to work best for many is to copy ( \"cc\" or \"bcc\") \nthemselves when they delegate via e-mail, and then to pull that \ncopy into their \"@WAITING FOR\" folder. (It's relati vely easy to \nprogram Outlook to automatically send any e-mail th at you \"cc\" \nto yourself into a designated folder, which would r eplicate the \nprocess just described.) \nGetting E-mail \"In\" to \"Empty\" The method detailed above will \nenable you to actually get everything out of your e -mail in-basket, \nwhich will be a huge boon to your clarity about and  control of \nyour day-to-day work. You'll reclaim \"in\" as \"in,\" so anything \nresiding there will be like a message on your answe ring \nmachine—a blinking light telling you you need to pr ocess some- \nthing! Most people use their e-mail \"in\" for stagin g still-undecided \nactionable things and reference, a practice that ra pidly numbs \nthe mind: they know they've got to reassess everyth ing every \n*Microsoft Outlook allows users to copy or move e-m ails into its \"Tasks\" con- \ntext, which, if organized according to my recommend ed categories, could work \nequally well. \n153 \nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  I  PART TWO \ntime they glance at the screen. If you never had more \nthan a screenful of e-mails, this approach might \nbe reasonably functional, but with the volume most \nprofessionals are dealing with these days, that doe sn't \napply. \nAgain, getting \"in\" empty doesn't mean you've \nhandled everything. It means that you've DELETED wh at you \ncould, FILED what you wanted to keep but don't need  to act on, \nDONE the less-than-two-minute responses, and moved into \nyour reminder folders all the things you're waiting  for and all your \nactionable e-mails. Now you can open the \"@ACTION\" file and \nreview the e-mails that you've determined you need to spend time \non. Isn't that process easier to relate to than fum bling through \nmultiple screens, fearing all the while that you ma y miss some- \nthing that'll blow up on you? \nA Caution About Dispersing Reminders of Your Action s \nThere's an obvious danger in putting reminders of \nthings you need to do somewhere out of sight. The \nfunction of an organization system is primarily to \nsupply the reminders you need to see when you need \nto see them, so you can trust your choices about wh at \nyou're doing (and what you're not doing).

True, most \nfolders in e-mail should be used for reference or a rchived materi- \nals, but it's also possible to set up a workable sy stem that will keep \nyour actionable messages discretely organized, outs ide of the \"in\" \narea itself (which is where most people keep them).\nI recommend that you create one folder for any long er-than- \ntwo-minute e-mails that you need to act on (again, you should be \nable to dispatch many messages right off the bat by  following the \ntwo-minute rule). The folder name should begin with  a prefix let- \nter or symbol so that (1) it looks different from y our reference \nfolders and (2) it sits at the top of your folders in the navigator bar. \nUse something like the \"@\" sign in Microsoft or the  dash (\"-\") in \nCHAPTER 7 |  ORGANIZING: SETTING UP THE RIGHT BUCKETS \nLotus, which sort into their systems at the top. Yo ur resulting \n\"FACTION\" folder will hold those e-mails that you n eed to do \nsomething about. \nNext you can create a folder titled \"@WAITING FOR,\"\nwhich will show up in the same place as the \"@ACTIO N\" folder. \nThen, as you receive e-mails that indicate that som eone is going \nto do something that you care about tracking, you c an drag them \nover into the \"@WAITING FOR\" file. It can also hold  reminders \nfor anything that you delegate via e-mail: when you  forward \nsomething, or use e-mail to make a request or deleg ate an action, \njust save a copy into the \"@WAITING FOR\" file.* \nSome applications (such as Lotus Notes) allow you t o file a \ncopy of an e-mail into one of your folders as you s end it (with a \n\"Send and File\" button). Others (e.g., Outlook) wil l simultane- \nously save only into your universal \"Sent Mail\" fol der. In the latter \ncase, what seems to work best for many is to copy ( \"cc\" or \"bcc\") \nthemselves when they delegate via e-mail, and then to pull that \ncopy into their \"@WAITING FOR\" folder.

Before yo u leave the \noffice for the day, the actionable e-mails that you  still have pend- \ning must be reviewed individually, just like your \" Calls\" or \"At \nComputer\" lists. In essence, \"@ACTION\" is an extens ion of your \n\"At Computer\" list and should be handled in exactly  the same \nfashion. Your paper-based \"Pending\" workflow must l ikewise be \nassessed like a list if the paper materials are bei ng used as your \nonly reminders. \nDistributing action triggers in a folder, on lists,  and/or in an \ne-mail system is perfectly OK, as long as you review all of the cate- \ngories to which you've entrusted your triggers equa lly, as required. You \ndon't want things lurking in the recesses of your s ystems and not \nbeing used for their intended purpose: reminding yo u. \n154 It requires much \nless energy to \nmaintain e-mail at \na zero base than at \na thousand base. \n\"Out of sight, out of \nmind\" is not really \nout of mind. \nCHAPTER 7  |  ORGANIZING: SETTING UP THE RIGHT BUCKETS \nIn order to hang out with friends or take a long, a imless walk \nand truly have nothing on your mind, you've got to know where \nall your actionable items are located, what they ar e, and that they \nwill wait. And you need to be able to do that in a few seconds, \nnot days. \nOrganizing Project Reminders \nCreating and maintaining one list of all your proje cts (that is, \nagain, every commitment or desired outcome that may  require \nmore than one action step to complete) can be a pro found experi- \nence! You probably have more of them than you think . If you \nhaven't done so already, I recommend that initially  you make a \n\"Projects\" list in a very simple format, similar to  the ones you've \nused for your lists of actions: it can be a categor y in a digital orga- \nnizer, a page in a loose-leaf planner, or even a si ngle file folder \nlabeled \"PROJECTS,\" with either a master list or se parate sheets \nof paper for each one. \nThe \"Projects\" List(s) \nThe \"Projects\" list is not meant to hold plans or d etails about your \nprojects themselves, nor should you try to keep it arranged by pri- \nority or size or urgency—it's just a comprehensive index of your \nopen loops. You actually won't be working off of th e \"Projects\" list \nduring your day-to-day activities; for the most par t, your action \nlists and any ad hoc tasks that come up will consti tute your tactical \nin-the-moment focus. Remember, you can't do a proj- \nect, you can only do the action steps it requires. \nThe real value of the \"Projects\" list lies in the \ncomplete review it can provide (at least once a wee k), \nallowing you to ensure that you have action steps \ndefined for all of your projects, and that nothing is \nslipping through the cracks. A quick glance at this\nlist from time to time will enhance your underlying\n155 A complete and \ncurrent \"Projects\" \nlist is the major \noperational tool for \nmoving from tree- \nhugging to forest\nmanagement.\n156 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  |  PART TWO \nsense of control. You'll also know that you have an  inventory \navailable to you (and to others) whenever it seems advisable to \nevaluate workload(s). \nOne List, or Subdivided? \nMost people find that one list is the best way to g o because \nit serves as a master inventory rather than as a da ily prioritiz- \ning guideline. The organizing system merely provide s placeholders \nfor all your open loops and options so your mind ca n more \neasily make the necessary intuitive, moment-to-mome nt strategic \ndecisions. \nFrankly, it doesn't matter how many different lists  of projects \nyou have, so long as you look at the contents of all of them as \noften as you need to, since for the most part you'l l do that in one \nfell swoop during your Weekly Review. \nSome Common Ways to Subsort Projects \nThere are some situations in which it makes good se nse to sub- \nsort a \"Projects\" list. Let's look at these one by one. \nPersonal/Professional Many people feel more comfortable see- \ning their lists divided up",

    "text": " system is primarily to \nsupply the reminders you need to see when you need \nto see them, so you can trust your choices about wh at \nyou're doing (and what you're not doing). Before yo u leave the \noffice for the day, the actionable e-mails that you  still have pend- \ning must be reviewed individually, just like your \" Calls\" or \"At \nComputer\" lists. In essence, \"@ACTION\" is an extens ion of your \n\"At Computer\" list and should be handled in exactly  the same \nfashion. Your paper-based \"Pending\" workflow must l ikewise be \nassessed like a list if the paper materials are bei ng used as your \nonly reminders. \nDistributing action triggers in a folder, on lists,  and/or in an \ne-mail system is perfectly OK, as long as you review all of the cate- \ngories to which you've entrusted your triggers equa lly, as required. You \ndon't want things lurking in the recesses of your s ystems and not \nbeing used for their intended purpose: reminding yo u. \n154 It requires much \nless energy to \nmaintain e-mail at \na zero base than at \na thousand base. \n\"Out of sight, out of \nmind\" is not really \nout of mind. \nCHAPTER 7  |  ORGANIZING: SETTING UP THE RIGHT BUCKETS \nIn order to hang out with friends or take a long, a imless walk \nand truly have nothing on your mind, you've got to know where \nall your actionable items are located, what they ar e, and that they \nwill wait. And you need to be able to do that in a few seconds, \nnot days. \nOrganizing Project Reminders \nCreating and maintaining one list of all your proje cts (that is, \nagain, every commitment or desired outcome that may  require \nmore than one action step to complete) can be a pro found experi- \nence! You probably have more of them than you think . If you \nhaven't done so already, I recommend that initially  you make a \n\"Projects\" list in a very simple format, similar to  the ones you've \nused for your lists of actions: it can be a categor y in a digital orga- \nnizer, a page in a loose-leaf planner, or even a si ngle file folder \nlabeled \"PROJECT",

    "text": " \nThere are some situations in which it makes good se nse to sub- \nsort a \"Projects\" list. Let's look at these one by one. \nPersonal/Professional Many people feel more comfortable see- \ning their lists divided up between personal and pro fessional \n* projects. If you're among them, be advised that y our \"Personal\" \nlist will need to be reviewed as judiciously as you r \"Professional\" \none, and not just saved for weekends. Many actions on personal \nthings will need to be handled on weekdays, exactly  like every- \nthing else. And often some of the greatest pressure s on profes- \nsionals stem from the personal aspects of their liv es that they are \nletting slip. \nDelegated Projects If you're a senior manager or executive, you \nprobably have several projects that you are directl y responsible for \nbut have handed off to people who report to you. Wh ile you \ncould, of course, put them on your \"Waiting For\" li st, it might \nmake better sense to create a \"Projects—Delegated\" list to \ntrack \nCHAPTER 7  |  ORGANIZING: SETTING UP THE RIGHT BUCKETS \nthem: your task will be simply to review the list r egularly enough \nto ensure that everything on it is moving along app ropriately. \nSpecific Types of Projects Some professionals have as part of their \nwork several different projects of the same type, which in some \ninstances it maybe valuable to group together as a sublist of \"Proj- \nects.\" For example, I maintain a separate category called \"Projects \nto Deliver,\" a chronological listing of all the upc oming seminars, \ncoaching, and consulting assignments I've committed  to. These \nevents are \"projects\" like the rest, in that I need  to keep noting \nwhether things are moving along on and in place for  them until \nthey're completed. But I find it helpful to see the m all organized \non one list, in the order in which they are coming up on my calen- \ndar, apart from my other projects. \nIf you are a real estate agent, sell consulting ser vices, or \ndevelop proposals for a relatively small number of prospective \nclients in any profession, you will likely find it useful to see all of \nyour outstanding \"sales relationships in progress\" in one view. \nThis could be a separate list in your planner calle d \"Client \nProjects in Development,\" or if you already have fi le folders for \neach in-progress project, it may suffice to group t hem all in one \nfile stand on your credenza. Just realize that this  approach will \nwork only if it represents a complete set of all of  those situa- \ntions that require action, and only if you review t hem regularly \nalong with the rest of your projects, keeping them current and \nconscious. \nWhat About Subprojects? \nSome of your projects will likely have major sub projects, each of \nwhich could in theory be seen as a whole project. I f you're moving \ninto a new house, for instance, and are upgrading a nd changing \nmuch of the property, you may have a list of action able items like \n\"Finalize landscaping,\" \"Renovate kitchen,\" \"Rewire  basement,\" \nand so on, all of which could in themselves be cons idered separate \nprojects. Do you make all of this one entry on your  \"Projects\" \n157 \nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  I  PART TWO \nlist—say, \"Finish new home renovations\"—or do you w rite \nup \neach of the subprojects as an individual line item?\nActually, it won't matter, as long as you review al l the compo- \nnents of the project as frequently as you need to t o stay produc- \ntive. No external tool or organizing format is goin g to be perfect \nfor sorting both horizontally across and vertically  down through \nall your projects; you'll still have to be aware of  the whole in some \ncohesive way (such as via your Weekly Review). If y ou make the \nlarge project your one listing on your \"Projects\" l ist, you'll want to \nkeep a list of the subprojects and/or the project p lan itself as \"proj- \nect support material\" to be reviewed when you come to that major \nitem. I would recommend doing it this way if big pi eces of the \nproject are dependent on other pieces getting done first. In that \nscenario you might have subprojects with no next ac tions attached \nto them because they are in a sense \"waiting for\" o ther things to \nhappen before they can move forward. For instance, you might \nnot be able to start on \"Renovate kitchen\" until yo u finish \"Rewire",

Let's look at these one by one. \nPersonal/Professional Many people feel more comfortable see- \ning their lists divided up between personal and pro fessional \n* projects. If you're among them, be advised that y our \"Personal\" \nlist will need to be reviewed as judiciously as you r \"Professional\" \none, and not just saved for weekends. Many actions on personal \nthings will need to be handled on weekdays, exactly  like every- \nthing else. And often some of the greatest pressure s on profes- \nsionals stem from the personal aspects of their liv es that they are \nletting slip. \nDelegated Projects If you're a senior manager or executive, you \nprobably have several projects that you are directl y responsible for \nbut have handed off to people who report to you. Wh ile you \ncould, of course, put them on your \"Waiting For\" li st, it might \nmake better sense to create a \"Projects—Delegated\" list to \ntrack \nCHAPTER 7  |  ORGANIZING: SETTING UP THE RIGHT BUCKETS \nthem: your task will be simply to review the list r egularly enough \nto ensure that everything on it is moving along app ropriately. \nSpecific Types of Projects Some professionals have as part of their \nwork several different projects of the same type, which in some \ninstances it maybe valuable to group together as a sublist of \"Proj- \nects.\" For example, I maintain a separate category called \"Projects \nto Deliver,\" a chronological listing of all the upc oming seminars, \ncoaching, and consulting assignments I've committed  to. These \nevents are \"projects\" like the rest, in that I need  to keep noting \nwhether things are moving along on and in place for  them until \nthey're completed. But I find it helpful to see the m all organized \non one list, in the order in which they are coming up on my calen- \ndar, apart from my other projects. \nIf you are a real estate agent, sell consulting ser vices, or \ndevelop proposals for a relatively small number of prospective \nclients in any profession, you will likely find it useful to see all of \nyour outstanding \"sales relationships in progress\" in one view. \nThis could be a separate list in",

If you're among them, be advised that y our \"Personal\" \nlist will need to be reviewed as judiciously as you r \"Professional\" \none, and not just saved for weekends.

And often some of the greatest pressure s on profes- \nsionals stem from the personal aspects of their liv es that they are \nletting slip. \nDelegated Projects If you're a senior manager or executive, you \nprobably have several projects that you are directl y responsible for \nbut have handed off to people who report to you.

Just realize that this  approach will \nwork only if it represents a complete set of all of  those situa- \ntions that require action, and only if you review t hem regularly \nalong with the rest of your projects, keeping them current and \nconscious. \nWhat About Subprojects? \nSome of your projects will likely have major sub projects, each of \nwhich could in theory be seen as a whole project. I f you're moving \ninto a new house, for instance, and are upgrading a nd changing \nmuch of the property, you may have a list of action able items like \n\"Finalize landscaping,\" \"Renovate kitchen,\" \"Rewire  basement,\" \nand so on, all of which could in themselves be cons idered separate \nprojects. Do you make all of this one entry on your  \"Projects\" \n157 \nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  I  PART TWO \nlist—say, \"Finish new home renovations\"—or do you w rite \nup \neach of the subprojects as an individual line item?\nActually, it won't matter, as long as you review al l the compo- \nnents of the project as frequently as you need to t o stay produc- \ntive. No external tool or organizing format is goin g to be perfect \nfor sorting both horizontally across and vertically  down through \nall your projects; you'll still have to be aware of  the whole in some \ncohesive way (such as via your Weekly Review). If y ou make the \nlarge project your one listing on your \"Projects\" l ist, you'll want to \nkeep a list of the subprojects and/or the project p lan itself as \"proj- \nect support material\" to be reviewed when you come to that major \nitem. I would recommend doing it this way if big pi eces of the \nproject are dependent on other pieces getting done first. In that \nscenario you might have subprojects with no next ac tions attached \n",

For instance, you might \nnot be able to start on \"Renovate kitchen\" until yo u finish \"Rewire \nbasement.\" However, you might be able to proceed on  \"Finalize \nlandscaping\" independent of either of the other sub projects. You \nwould therefore want a next action to be continuall y current on \n\"Rewire basement\" and \"Finalize landscaping.\" \nDon't be too concerned about which way is best. If you're not \n* sure, I'd vote for putting your Big Projects on t he \"Projects\" list \nand holding the subpieces in your project support \nmaterial, making sure to include them in your \nWeekly Review, If that arrangement doesn't feel \nquite right, try including the active and independent \nsubprojects as separate entries on your master list . \nThere's no perfect system for tracking all your \nprojects and subprojects the same way. You just nee d \nto know you have projects and, if they have associated \ncomponents, where to find the appropriate reminders\nfor them. \n158 How you list \nprojects and \nsubprojects is up to \nyou; just be sure \nyou know where to \nfind all the moving \nparts. \nCHAPTER 7  |  ORGANIZING: SETTING UP THE RIGHT BUCKETS \nProject Support Materials \nProject support materials are not project actions, and they're not \nproject reminders. They're resources to support you r actions and \nthinking about your projects. \nDon't Use Support Material for Reminding Typically, people use \nstacks of papers and thickly stuffed file folders as reminders that \n(1) they've got a project, and (2) they've got to do something abou t \nit. They're essentially making support materials se rve as action \nreminders. The problem is that next actions and \"Wa iting For\" \nitems on these projects have usually not been deter mined and are \npsychologically still embedded in the stacks and th e folders—\ngiving them the aura of just more \"stuff\" that repe ls its (un)orga- \nnizer instead of attracting him or her to action. W hen you're on \nthe run, in the heat of the activities of the day, files like that are \nthe last thing you'll want to pick up and peruse fo r actions. You'll \nactually go numb to the files and the piles because  they don't \nprompt you to do anything and they simply create mo re anxiety. \nIf you're in this kind of situation, you must first  add the proj- \nect itself to your \"Projects\" list, as a reminder t hat there's an out- \ncome to be achieved. Then the action steps and \"Wai ting For\" \nitems must be put onto their appropriate action rem inder lists. \nFinally, when it's time to actually do an action, like making a call to \nsomeone about the project, you can pull out all the  materials you \nthink you might need to have as support during the conversation. \nTo reiterate, you don't want to use support materials as your \nprimary reminders of what to do—that should be rele gated to \nyour action lists. If, however, the materials conta in project plans \nand overviews in addition to ad hoc archival and re ference infor- \nmation, you may want to keep them a little more vis ibly accessible \nthan you do the pure reference materials in your fi ling cabinet. \nThe latter place is fine for support stuff, too, so  long as you have \nthe discipline to pull out the file drawer and take  a look at the \nplan every time you do your Weekly Review. If not, you're better \n159 \n160 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  |  PART TWO \noff storing those kinds of project support files in  a standing \nfile holder or a separate \"Pending\" stack-basket on  your desk or \ncredenza. \nTo return to the previous example of moving into a new \nhouse, you could have a folder labeled \"New House\" containing \nall the plans and details and notes about the lands caping and \nthe kitchen and the basement. In your Weekly Review , when \nyou came to \"Finish new home renovations\" on your \" Projects\" \nlist, you'd pull out the \"New House\" file and thumb  through all \nyour notes to ensure that you weren't missing any p ossible next \nactions.

    "text": "to them because they are in a sense \"waiting for\" o ther things to \nhappen before they can move forward. For instance, you might \nnot be able to start on \"Renovate kitchen\" until yo u finish \"Rewire \nbasement.\" However, you might be able to proceed on  \"Finalize \nlandscaping\" independent of either of the other sub projects. You \nwould therefore want a next action to be continuall y current on \n\"Rewire basement\" and \"Finalize landscaping.\" \nDon't be too concerned about which way is best. If you're not \n* sure, I'd vote for putting your Big Projects on t he \"Projects\" list \nand holding the subpieces in your project support \nmaterial, making sure to include them in your \nWeekly Review, If that arrangement doesn't feel \nquite right, try including the active and independent \nsubprojects as separate entries on your master list . \nThere's no perfect system for tracking all your \nprojects and subprojects the same way. You just nee d \nto know you have projects and, if they have associated \ncomponents, where to find the appropriate reminders\nfor them. \n158 How you list \nprojects and \nsubprojects is up to \nyou; just be sure \nyou know where to \nfind all the moving \nparts. \nCHAPTER 7  |  ORGANIZING: SETTING UP THE RIGHT BUCKETS \nProject Support Materials \nProject support materials are not project actions, and they're not \nproject reminders. They're resources to support you r actions and \nthinking about your projects. \nDon't Use Support Material for Reminding Typically, people use \nstacks of papers and thickly stuffed file folders as reminders that \n(1) they've got a project, and (2) they've got to do something abou t \nit. They're essentially making support materials se rve as action \nreminders. The problem is that next actions and \"Wa iting For\" \nitems on these projects have usually not been deter mined and are \npsychologically still embedded in the stacks and th e folders—\ngiving them the aura of just more \"stuff\" that repe ls its (un)orga- \nnizer instead of attracting him or her to action. W hen you're on \nthe run, in the heat of the activities of the day, files like that are \nthe last thing you'll want to pick up and peruse fo r actions",

For instance, you might \nnot be able to start on \"Renovate kitchen\" until yo u finish \"Rewire \nbasement.\" However, you might be able to proceed on  \"Finalize \nlandscaping\" independent of either of the other sub projects. You \nwould therefore want a next action to be continuall y current on \n\"Rewire basement\" and \"Finalize landscaping.\" \nDon't be too concerned about which way is best. If you're not \n* sure, I'd vote for putting your Big Projects on t he \"Projects\" list \nand holding the subpieces in your project support \nmaterial, making sure to include them in your \nWeekly Review, If that arrangement doesn't feel \nquite right, try including the active and independent \nsubprojects as separate entries on your master list . \nThere's no perfect system for tracking all your \nprojects and subprojects the same way. You just nee d \nto know you have projects and, if they have associated \ncomponents, where to find the appropriate reminders\nfor them. \n158 How you list \nprojects and \nsubprojects is up",

The latter can b e more ef- \nfectively organized within your action-lists system . Client in- \nformation is just that, and it can be folded into a  general-reference \nfile on the client or stored within a client-focuse d library. (I \nuse Act! for the single great feature it offers of allowing me \nto cross-reference general company information and signifi- \ncant interactions with key people within the compan y. It's just \na good client-centered database.) If I need to call  a client, I \ndon't want that reminder embedded anywhere but on m y \"Calls\" \nlist. \nOrganizing Ad Hoc Project Thinking \nIn chapter 3, I suggested that you will often have ideas that you'll \nwant to keep about projects but that are not necess arily next \nactions. Those ideas fall into the broad category o f \"project sup- \nCHAPTER 7  I  ORGANIZING: SETTING UP THE RIGHT BUCKETS \nport materials,\" and may be anything from a notion about some- \nthing you might want to do on your next vacation to  a clarifica- \ntion of some major components in a project plan. Th ese thoughts \ncould come as you're driving down the freeway liste ning to a news \nstory on the radio, or reading a relevant article. What \ndo you do with that kind of material? \nMy recommendation here is that you consider \nwhere you're keeping tabs on the project or topic \nitself, how you might add information to it in that\nformat, and where you might store any more exten- \nsive data associated with it. Most professionals wi ll have several \noptions for how to handle support materials, includ ing attaching \nnotes to a list item, organizing digital informatio n in e-mail \nand/or databases, and maintaining paper-based files  and notes in \nnotebooks. \nAttached Notes Most organizing software allows you to attach a \ndigital \"note\" to a list or calendar entry. If you' re keeping a \"Proj- \nects\" list within the software, you can go to the p roject you had a \nthought about, open or attach a \"note\" to it, and t ype in your idea. \nThis is an excellent way to capture \"back-of-the-en velope\" project \nthinking. If your \"Projects\" list is paper-based, y ou can attach a \nPost-it note next to the item on your master list o r, if you're a low- \ntech type, on the item's separate sheet. In any cas e, you'll need to \nremember to look at the attachment when you review your proj- \nect, to make use of the data. \nE-mail and Databases E-mails that might contain good informa- \ntion related to your projects can be held in a dedi cated e-mail folder \n(just follow the instructions on pages 152-53 for \" @ACTION\" \nand call it something like \"@PROJECTS\"). You may al so find it \nworthwhile, if you don't have one already, to set u p a more rigor- \nous kind of digital database for organizing your th inking on a \nproject or topic. If your company uses Lotus Notes,  for example, \nyou can create a project database either for your o wn private use \n161 There is no need\" \never to lose an idea \nabout a project,\ntheme, or topic.\n162 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  I  PART TWO \non your PC or to be shared with others in your netw ork.* It's \nworth looking into some of the other types of free- form databases \nthat are on the market, too—even just for your own use. It's great \nto be able to cut and paste from the Web or from e- mails and drop \ndata under a topic somewhere or type in your own th oughts. Be \nsure, also, to explore the technology and tools tha t you already \nhave—just learning how to use all the lists and att achments in \nsomething like the Palm organizer may provide you w ith suffi- \ncient \"back-of-the-envelope\" capability. \nPaper-Based Files Having a separate file folder devoted to each \nproject makes a lot of sense when you're accumulati ng paper- \nbased materials",

The latter can b e more ef- \nfectively organized within your action-lists system . Client in- \nformation is just that, and it can be folded into a  general-reference \nfile on the client or stored within a client-focuse d library. (I \nuse Act! for the single great feature it offers of allowing me \nto cross-reference general company information and signifi- \ncant interactions with key people within the compan y. It's just \na good client-centered database.) If I need to call  a client, I \ndon't want that reminder embedded anywhere but on m y \"Calls\" \nlist. \nOrganizing Ad Hoc Project Thinking \nIn chapter 3, I suggested that you will often have ideas that you'll \nwant to keep about projects but that are not necess arily next \nactions.

Th ese thoughts \ncould come as you're driving down the freeway liste ning to a news \nstory on the radio, or reading a relevant article. What \ndo you do with that kind of material? \nMy recommendation here is that you consider \nwhere you're keeping tabs on the project or topic \nitself, how you might add information to it in that\nformat, and where you might store any more exten- \nsive data associated with it. Most professionals wi ll have several \noptions for how to handle support materials, includ ing attaching \nnotes to a list item, organizing digital informatio n in e-mail \nand/or databases, and maintaining paper-based files  and notes in \nnotebooks. \n",

If you' re keeping a \"Proj- \nects\" list within the software, you can go to the p roject you had a \nthought about, open or attach a \"note\" to it, and t ype in your idea. \nThis is an excellent way to capture \"back-of-the-en velope\" project \nthinking. If your \"Projects\" list is paper-based, y ou can attach a \nPost-it note next to the item on your master list o r, if you're a low- \ntech type, on the item's separate sheet. In any cas e, you'll need to \nremember to look at the attachment when you review your proj- \nect, to make use of the data. \nE-mail and Databases E-mails that might contain good informa- \ntion related to your projects can be held in a dedi cated e-mail folder \n(just follow the instructions on pages 152-53 for \" @ACTION\" \nand call it something like \"@PROJECTS\"). You may al so find it \nworthwhile, if you don't have one already, to set u p a more rigor- \nous kind of digital database for organizing your th inking on a \nproject or topic.

If you' re keeping a \"Proj- \nects\" list within the software, you can go to the p roject you had a \nthought about, open or attach a \"note\" to it, and t ype in your idea. \nThis is an excellent way to capture \"back-of-the-en velope\" project \nthinking. If your \"Projects\" list is paper-based, y ou can attach a \nPost-it note next to the item on your master list o r, if you're a low- \ntech type, on the item's separate sheet. In any cas e, you'll need to \nremember to look at the attachment when you review your proj- \nect, to make use of the data. \nE-mail and Databases E-mails that might contain good informa- \ntion related to your projects can be held in a dedi cated e-mail folder \n",

    "text": " organizer may provide you w ith suffi- \ncient \"back-of-the-envelope\" capability. \nPaper-Based Files Having a separate file folder devoted to each \nproject makes a lot of sense when you're accumulati ng paper- \nbased materials; it may be low-tech, but it's an el egant solution \nnonetheless. Simplicity and ease of handling make f or a good \ngeneral-reference filing system—one that lets you f eel comfort- \nable about creating a folder for scraps of paper fr om a meeting. \nPages in Notebooks A great advantage of paper-based loose-leaf \nnotebooks is that you can dedicate a whole page or group of pages \nto an individual project. For years I maintained a midsize notebook \nwith a \"Projects\" list in front and a \"Project Supp ort\" section \ntoward the back, where I always had some blank page s to capture \nany random thinking or plans and details about proj ects on my list. \nEach of the methods described above can be effectiv e in organiz- \ning project thinking. The key is that you must cons istently look \nfor any action steps inherent in your project notes , and review the \nnotes themselves as often as you think is necessary , given the \nnature of the project. \nYou'll also want to clear out many of your notes on ce they \n*Many Lotus Notes users don't even realize they can  do this, but in fact it's one \nof the program's most powerful features. If you hav e Notes, check with your \nresident IT resource person and have him or her req uest system permission and \nshow you how. \nCHAPTER 7  I  ORGANIZING: SETTING UP THE RIGHT BUCKETS \nbecome inactive or unreal, to keep the whole system  from catch- \ning the \"stale\" virus. I've found a lot of value in  capturing these \ntypes of thoughts, more for the way it consistently  helps my \nthinking process than because I end up using every idea (most I \ndon't!). But I try to make sure not to let my old t houghts stay \naround too long, pretending they're useful when the y're not. \nOrganizing Nonactionable Data \nInterestingly, one of the biggest problems with mos t people's per- \nsonal management systems is that they blend a few a ctionable \nthings with a large amount of data and material tha t has value but \nno action attached. Having good, consistent structu res with \nwhich to manage the nonactionable items in our work  and lives is \nas important as managing our action and project rem inders. \nWhen the nonactionable items aren't properly manage d, they \nclog up the whole process. \nUnactionable items fall into two large categories: reference \nmaterials and reminders of things that need no acti on now but \nmight at a later date. \nReference Materials \nMuch of what comes across your desk and into your l ife in general \nis reference material. There's no action required, but it's informa- \ntion that you want to keep, for a variety of reason s. Your major \ndecisions will be how much to keep, how much room t o dedicate \nto it, what form it should be stored in, and where.  Much of that \nwill be a personal or organizational judgment call based upon \nlegal or logistical concerns or personal preference s. The only time \nyou should have attention on your reference materia l is when you \nneed to change your system in some way because you have too \nmuch or too little information, given your needs or  preferences. \nThe problem most people have psychologically with a ll their \nstuff is that it's still \"stuff\"—that is, they have n't decided what's \n163 \nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY |  PART TWO \nactionable and what's not. Once you've made a clean  distinction \nabout which is which, what's left as reference shou ld have no \npull or incompletion associated with it—it's just y our library. \nYour only decision then is how big a library you wa nt. When \nyou've fully implemented this action-management met ho- \ndology, you can be as big a packrat as your space ( physical \nand digital) will allow. As I've increased the size  of the hard \ndisk in my computer, I've kept that much more e-mai l in my \narchives. The more the merrier, as far as I'm conce rned, since \nincreasing the volume of pure reference material ad ds no psychic \nweight. \nThe Variety of Reference Systems \nThere are a number of ways to organize reference ma terial, and \nmany types of tools to use. What follows is a brief  discussion of \nsome of the most common. \n• General-reference filing—paper and e-mail",

For years I maintained a midsize notebook \nwith a \"Projects\" list in front and a \"Project Supp ort\" section \ntoward the back, where I always had some blank page s to capture \nany random thinking or plans and details about proj ects on my list. \nEach of the methods described above can be effectiv e in organiz- \ning project thinking. The key is that you must cons istently look \nfor any action steps inherent in your project notes , and review the \nnotes themselves as often as you think is necessary , given the \nnature of the project. \nYou'll also want to clear out many of your notes on ce they \n*Many Lotus Notes users don't even realize they can  do this, but in fact it's one \nof the program's most powerful features. If you hav e Notes, check with your \nresident IT resource person and have him or her req uest system permission and \nshow you how. \nCHAPTER 7  I  ORGANIZING: SETTING UP THE RIGHT BUCKETS \nbecome inactive or unreal, to keep the whole system  from catch- \ning the \"stale\" virus. I've found a lot of value in  capturing these \ntypes of thoughts, more for the way it consistently  helps my \nthinking process than because I end up using every idea (most I \ndon't!). But I try to make sure not to let my old t houghts stay \naround too long, pretending they're useful when the y're not. \nOrganizing Nonactionable Data \nInterestingly, one of the biggest problems with mos t people's per- \nsonal management systems is that they blend a few a ctionable \nthings with a large amount of data and material tha t has value",

Simplicity and ease of handling make f or a good \ngeneral-reference filing system—one that lets you f eel comfort- \nable about creating a folder for scraps of paper fr om a meeting. \nPages in Notebooks A great advantage of paper-based loose-leaf \nnotebooks is that you can dedicate a whole page or group of pages \nto an individual project. For years I maintained a midsize notebook \nwith a \"Projects\" list in front and a \"Project Supp ort\" section \ntoward the back, where I always had some blank page s to capture \nany random thinking or plans and details about proj ects on my list. \nEach of the methods described above can be effectiv e in organiz- \ning project thinking. The key is that you must cons istently look \nfor any action steps inherent in your project notes , and review the \nnotes themselves as often as you think is",

Having good, consistent structu res with \nwhich to manage the nonactionable items in our work  and lives is \nas important as managing our action and project rem inders. \nWhen the nonactionable items aren't properly manage d, they \nclog up the whole process. \nUnactionable items fall into two large categories: reference \nmaterials and reminders of things that need no acti on now but \nmight at a later date. \nReference Materials \nMuch of what comes across your desk and into your l ife in general \nis reference material. There's no action required, but it's informa- \ntion that you want to keep, for a variety of reason s. Your major \ndecisions will be how much to keep, how much room t o dedicate \nto it, what form it should be stored in, and where.  Much of that \nwill be a personal or organizational judgment call based upon \nlegal or logistical concerns or personal preference s. The only time \nyou should have attention on your reference materia l is when you \nneed to change your system in some way because you have too \nmuch or too little information, given your needs or  preferences. \nThe problem most people have psychologically with a ll their \nstuff is that it's still \"stuff\"—that is, they have n't decided what's \n163 \nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY |  PART TWO \nactionable and what's not. Once you've made a clean  distinction \nabout which is which, what's left as reference shou ld have no \npull or incompletion associated with it—it's just y our library. \nYour only decision then is how big a library you wa nt. When \nyou've fully implemented this action-management met ho- \ndology, you can be as big a packrat as your space ( physical \nand digital) will allow. As I've increased the size  of the hard \ndisk in my computer, I've kept that much more e-mai l in my \narchives. The more the merrier, as far as I'm conce rned, since \nincreasing the volume of pure reference material ad ds no psychic \nweight. \nThe Variety of",

Having good, consistent structu res with \nwhich to manage the nonactionable items in our work  and lives is \nas important as managing our action and project rem inders. \nWhen the nonactionable items aren't properly manage d, they \nclog up the whole process. \nUnactionable items fall into two large categories: reference \nmaterials and reminders of things that need no acti on now but \nmight at a later date. \nReference Materials \nMuch of what comes across your desk and into your l ife in general \nis reference material. There's no action required, but it's informa- \ntion that you want to keep, for a variety of reason s. Your major \ndecisions will be how much to keep, how much room t o dedicate \nto it, what form it should be stored in, and where.  Much of that \nwill be a personal or organizational judgment call based upon \nlegal or logistical concerns or personal preference s",

    "text": " Reference Systems \nThere are a number of ways to organize reference ma terial, and \nmany types of tools to use. What follows is a brief  discussion of \nsome of the most common. \n• General-reference filing—paper and e-mail \n• Large-category filing \n• Rolodexes and contact managers \n• Libraries and archives \nGeneral-Reference Filing As I've said, a good filing \nsystem is critical for processing and organizing yo ur \nstuff. It's also a must for dealing with the someti mes \nhuge volume of paper-based materials that are valu-\nable for you for one reason or another. Ideally you\nwill already have set up a general-reference filing  sys- \ntem as you were processing \"in.\" You need to feel \ncomfortable storing even a single piece of paper th at \nyou might want to refer to later, and your system \nmust be informal and accessible enough that it's a snap to file it \naway in your alphabetized general-reference system,  right at hand \nwhere you work. If you're not set up that way yet, look back at \nchapter 4 for help on this topic. \n164 Your filing system \nshould be a simple \nlibrary of data, \neasily \nretrievable—\nnot your reminder \nfor actions, \nprojects, priorities, \nCHAPTER 7  I  ORGANIZING: SETTING UP THE RIGHT BUCKETS \nMost people seem to wind up with 200 to 400 paper-b ased \ngeneral-reference files and 30 to 100 e-mail refere nce folders. \nLarge-Category Filing Any topic that requires more than fifty \nfile folders should probably be given its own secti on or drawer, \nwith its own alpha-sorted system. For instance, if you're managing \na corporate merger and need to keep hold of a lot o f the paper- \nwork, you may want to dedicate two or three whole f ile cabinets to \nall the documentation required in the due-diligence  process. If \ngardening or sailing or cooking is your passion, yo u may need at \nleast a whole file drawer for those designated hobb ies. \nBear in mind that if your \"area of focus\" has suppo rt material \nthat could blend into other \"areas of focus,\" you m ay run into the \ndilemma of whether to store the information in gene ral reference \nor in the specialized reference files. When you rea d a great article \nabout wood fencing and want to keep it, does that g o in your \n\"Garden\" cabinet or in the general system with othe r information \nabout home-related projects? As a general rule, it' s best to stick \nwith one general-reference system except for a very  limited num- \nber of discrete topics. \nRolodexes and Contact Managers Much of the information that \nyou need to keep is directly related to people in y our network. You \nneed to track contact information of all sorts—home  and office \nphone numbers and addresses, cell-phone numbers, fa x numbers, \ne-mail addresses, and so on. In addition, if you fi nd it useful, you \nmay want to maintain information about birthdays, n ames of \nfriends' and colleagues' family members, hobbies, f avorite wines \nand foods, and the like. In a more rigorous profess ional vein, you \nmay need or want to track hire dates, performance-r eview dates, \ngoals and objectives, and other potentially relevan t data for staff \ndevelopment purposes. \nThe telephone/address section of most of the organi zers sold \nin the last fifty years is probably (along with the  calendar) their \nmost commonly used component. Everyone needs to kee p track \n165 \nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY I  PART TWO \nof phone numbers. It's instructive to note that thi s is purely and \nsimply reference material. No action is required—th is is just \ninformation that you might need to access in the fu ture. \nSo there's no big mystery about how to organize it,  aside \nfrom the logistics for your individual needs. Again , the only prob- \nlem comes up when people try to make their Rolodexe s serve as \ntools for reminding them about things they need to do. That \ndoesn't work. As long as all the actions relative t o people you \nknow have been identified and tracked in your actio n reminder \nlists, there's no role for telephone and address sy stems to fill other \nthan being a neutral address book. \nThe only issue then becomes how much information yo u \nneed to keep and where and in what equipment you ne ed to keep \nit in order to have it accessible when you want it.  Nothing's per- \nfect in that regard, but as the small digital tools  become easier to \nuse and connect to larger",

What follows is a brief  discussion of \nsome of the most common. \n• General-reference filing—paper and e-mail \n• Large-category filing \n• Rolodexes and contact managers \n• Libraries and archives \nGeneral-Reference Filing As I've said, a good filing \nsystem is critical for processing and organizing yo ur \nstuff. It's also a must for dealing with the someti mes \nhuge volume of paper-based materials that are valu-\nable for you for one reason or another. Ideally you\nwill already have set up a general-reference filing  sys- \ntem as you were processing \"in.\" You need to feel \ncomfortable storing even a single piece of paper th at \nyou might want to refer to later, and your system \nmust be informal and accessible enough that it's a snap to file it \naway in your alphabetized general-reference system,  right at hand \nwhere you work. If you're not set up that way yet, look back at \nchapter 4 for help on this topic. \n164 Your filing system \nshould be a simple \nlibrary of data, \neasily \nretrievable—\nnot your reminder \nfor actions, \nprojects, priorities, \nCHAPTER 7  I  ORGANIZING: SETTING UP THE RIGHT BUCKETS \nMost people seem to wind up with 200 to 400 paper-b ased \ngeneral-reference files and 30 to 100 e-mail refere nce folders. \nLarge-Category Filing Any topic that requires more than fifty \nfile folders should probably be given its own secti on or drawer, \nwith its own alpha-sorted system. For instance, if you're managing \na corporate merger and need to keep hold of a lot o f the paper- \nwork, you may want to dedicate two or three whole f ile cabinets to \nall the documentation required in the due-diligence  process. If \ngardening or sailing or cooking is your passion, yo u may need at \nleast a whole file drawer for those designated hobb ies. \nBear in mind that if your \"area of focus\" has suppo rt material \nthat could blend into other \"areas of focus,\" you m ay run into the \ndilemma of whether to store the information in gene ral reference \nor in the specialized reference files.

As a general rule, it' s best to stick \nwith one general-reference system except for a very  limited num- \nber of discrete topics. \nRolodexes and Contact Managers Much of the information that \nyou need to keep is directly related to people in y our network.

In addition, if you fi nd it useful, you \nmay want to maintain information about birthdays, n ames of \nfriends' and colleagues' family members, hobbies, f avorite wines \nand foods, and the like. In a more rigorous profess ional vein, you \nmay need or want to track hire dates, performance-r eview dates, \ngoals and objectives, and other potentially relevan t data for staff \ndevelopment purposes. \nThe telephone/address section of most of the organi zers sold \nin the last fifty years is probably (along with the  calendar) their \nmost commonly used component.

As long as all the actions relative t o people you \nknow have been identified and tracked in your actio n reminder \nlists, there's no role for telephone and address sy stems to fill other \nthan being a neutral address book. \nThe only issue then becomes how much information yo u \nneed to keep and",

Nothing's per- \nfect in that regard, but as the small digital tools  become easier to \nuse and connect to larger databases, you'll be able  to have more \ninformation at hand with the same or less effort. \nLibraries and Archives: Personalized Levels Information that \nmight be useful lives at many levels. You could pro bably find out \npretty much anything if you were willing to dig deep enough. The \nquestion of how much to keep, how close, and in wha t form, will \nbe a changing reality, given the variables of your needs and your \nparticular comfort levels with data. Relative to yo ur personal \norganization and productivity, this is not a core i ssue, \nso long as all of your projects and actions are in a \ncontrol system that you work with regularly. Refer-\nence material in all its forms then becomes nothing\nmore or less than material to capture and create \naccess to according to your particular proclivities  and \nrequirements. \nSome degree of consistency will always make \nthings easier. What kinds of things do you need wit h you all the \ntime? Those must go into your ubiquitous planner or  PDA. What \ndo you need specifically for meetings or off-site e vents? That \n166 If material is purely \nfor reference, the \nonly issue is \nwhether it's worth \nthe time and space \nrequired to keep it. \nCHAPTER 7  |  ORGANIZING: SETTING UP THE RIGHT BUCKETS \nshould be put into your briefcase, pack, satchel, o r purse. What \nmight you need when you're working in your office? That should \nbe put into your personal filing system or your net worked com- \nputer. What about rare situations relative to your job? Material \nneeded for those could be archived in departmental files or off- \nsite storage. What could you find anytime you might  need it, on \nthe Web? You don't need to do anything with that in formation, \nunless you need it when you're away from a Web conn ection, in \nwhich case you should print the data out when you'r e online and \nstore it in a file you can take with you. \nDo you see how that personal organization of refere nce \nmaterial is simply a logistical issue? Distinguishi ng actionable \nthings from nonactionable ones is the key success f actor in this \narena. Once you've done that, you have total freedo m to manage \nand organize as much or as little reference materia l as you want. \nIt's a highly individual decision that ought to be based on the ratio \nof the value received to the time and effort requir ed to capture and \nmaintain it. \nSomeday/Maybes \nThe last thing to deal with in your organization sy stem is how to \ntrack things that you may want to reassess in the f uture. These \ncould range from a special trip you might want to t ake one day, to \nbooks you might want to read, to projects you might  want to \ntackle in the next fiscal year, to skills and talen ts you might want \nto develop. For a full implementation of this model\nyou'll need some sort of \"back burner\" or \"on hold\"\ncomponent. \nThere are several ways to stage things for later \nreview, all of which will work to get them off your\ncurrent radar and your mind. You can put the items \non various versions of \"Someday/Maybe\" lists or \ntrigger them on your calendar or in a paper-based \n\"tickler\" system. \n167 Someday/Maybe's \nare not throwaway \nitems. They may be \nsome of the most\ninteresting and \ncreative things \nyou'll ever get\ninvolved with.\n168 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  |  PART TWO \n\"Someday/Maybe\" List \nIt's highly likely that if you did a complete mind- sweep when you \nwere collecting things out of your psychic RAM, you  came up with \nsome things you're not sure you want to commit to. \"Learn Span- \nish,\" \"Get Marcie a horse,\" \"Climb Mt, Washington,\"  and \"Build a \nguest cottage\" are typical projects that fall into this category. \nIf you haven't already done it, I recommend that yo u create a \n\"Someday/Maybe\" list in whatever organizing system you've cho- \nsen. Then give yourself permission to populate that  list with all \nthe items of that type that have occurred to you so  far. You'll \nprobably discover that simply having the list and s tarting to fill it \nout will cause you to come up with all kinds of cre ative ideas. \nYou",

    "text": "the items of that type that have occurred to you so  far. You'll \nprobably discover that simply having the list and s tarting to fill it \nout will cause you to come up with all kinds of cre ative ideas. \nYou may also be surprised to find that some of the things you \nwrite on the list will actually come to pass, almos t without your \nmaking any conscious effort to make them happen. If  you \nacknowledge the power of the imagination to foster changes in \nperception and performance, it's easy to see how ha ving a \n\"Someday/Maybe\" list out in front of your conscious  mind could \npotentially add many wonderful adventures to your l ife and work. \nWe're likely to seize opportunities when they arise  if we've already \nidentified and captured them as a possibility. That  has certainly \nbeen my own experience: learning to play the flute and how to sail \nbig boats both started in this category for me. In addition to \nyour in-basket, there are two rich sources to tap f or your \"Some- \nday/Maybe\" list: your creative imagination and your  list of current \nprojects. \nMake an Inventory of Your Creative Imaginings What are the \nthings you really might want to do someday if you h ave the time, \nmoney, and inclination? Write them on your have \"So meday/ \nMaybe\" list. Typical categories include: \n• Things to get or build for your home \n• Hobbies to take up \nCHAPTER 7  I  ORGANIZING: SETTING UP THE RIGHT BUCKETS \n• Skills to learn \n• Creative expressions to explore \n• Clothes and accessories to buy \n• Toys (gear!) to acquire \n• Trips to take \n• Organizations to join \n• Service projects to contribute to \n• Things to see and do \nReassess Your Current Projects    Now's a good time to review your \n\"Projects\" list from a more elevated perspective (t hat is, the stand- \npoint of your job and goals) and consider whether \nyou might transfer some of your current commit- \nments to \"Someday/Maybe.\" If on reflection you \nrealize that an optional project doesn't have a cha nce \nof getting your attention for the next months or \nmore, move it to this list. \nSpecial Categories of \"Someday/Maybe\" \nMore than likely you have some special interests th at involve lots \nof possible things to do. It can be fun to collect these on lists. For \ninstance: \n• Food—recipes, menus, restaurants, wines \n• Children—things to do with them \n• Books to read \n• CDs to buy \n• Videos to buy/rent \n• Cultural events to attend \n• Gift ideas \n• Garden ideas \n• Web sites to surf \n• Weekend trips to take \n• Meeting ideas \n• Party ideas \n169 What lies in our \npower to do, lies in \nour power not \nto do. \n—\n170 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  |  PART TWO \n• Ideas—Misc. (meaning you don't know where else to  put \nthem!) \nThese kinds of lists can be a cross between referen ce and \n\"Someday/Maybe\"—reference because you can just coll ect and \nadd to lists of good wines or restaurants or books,  to consult as \nyou like; \"Someday/Maybe\" because you might want to  review the \nlisted items on a regular basis to remind yourself to try one or \nmore of them at some point. \nIn any case, this is another great reason to have a n organizing \nsystem that makes it easy to capture things that ma y add value \nand variety and interest to your life—without clogg ing your mind \nand work space with undecided, unfinished business.\nThe Danger of \"Hold and Review\" Files and Piles \nMany people have created some sort of \"Hold and Rev iew\" pile or \nfile (or whole drawer) that vaguely fits within the  category of \n\"Someday/Maybe.\" They tell themselves, \"When I have  time, I \nmay like to get to this,\" and a \"Hold and Review\" f ile seems a con- \nvenient place to put it. I personally don't recomme nd this particu- \nlar kind of subsystem, because in virtually every c ase I have come \nacross, the client \"held\" but didn't \"review,\" and there was numb- \nness and resistance about the stack. The value of \" someday/ \nmaybe\" disappears if you don't put your conscious a wareness back \non it with some consistency. \nAlso, there's a big difference between something th at's man- \naged well, as a \"Someday/Maybe\" list, and something  that's just a \ncatchall bucket for \"stuff.\"",

It can be fun to collect these on lists. For \ninstance: \n• Food—recipes, menus, restaurants, wines \n• Children—things to do with them \n• Books to read \n• CDs to buy \n• Videos to buy/rent \n• Cultural events to attend \n• Gift ideas \n• Garden ideas \n• Web sites to surf \n• Weekend trips to take \n• Meeting ideas \n• Party ideas \n169 What lies in our \npower to do, lies in \nour power not \nto do. \n—\n170 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  |  PART TWO \n• Ideas—Misc. (meaning you don't know where else to  put \nthem!) \nThese kinds of lists can be a cross between referen ce and \n\"Someday/Maybe\"—reference because you can just coll ect and \nadd to lists of good wines or restaurants or books,  to consult as \nyou like; \"Someday/Maybe\" because you might want to  review the \nlisted items on a regular basis to remind yourself to try one or \nmore of them at some point. \nIn any case, this is another great reason to have a n organizing \nsystem that makes it easy to capture things that ma y add value \nand variety and interest to your life—without clogg ing your mind \nand work space with undecided, unfinished business.\nThe Danger of \"Hold and Review\" Files and Piles \nMany people have created some sort of \"Hold and Rev iew\" pile or \nfile (or whole drawer) that vaguely fits within the  category of \n\"Someday/Maybe.\" They tell themselves, \"When I have  time, I \nmay like to get to this,\" and a \"Hold and Review\" f ile seems a con- \nvenient place to put it. I personally don't recomme nd this particu- \nlar kind of subsystem, because in virtually every c ase I have come \nacross, the client \"held\" but didn't \"review,\" and there was numb- \nness and resistance about the stack. The value of \" someday/ \nmaybe\" disappears if you don't put your conscious a wareness back \non",

    "text": " it with some consistency. \nAlso, there's a big difference between something th at's man- \naged well, as a \"Someday/Maybe\" list, and something  that's just a \ncatchall bucket for \"stuff.\" Usually much of that s tuff needs to be \ntossed, some of it needs to go into \"Read/Review,\" some needs \nto be filed as reference, some belongs on the calen dar or in a \ntickler file (see page 173) for review in a month o r perhaps at the \nbeginning of the next quarter, and some actually ha s next actions \non it. Many times, after appropriately processing s omeone's \n\"Hold and Review\" drawer or file, I've discovered t here was noth- \ning left in it! \nCHAPTER 7  |  ORGANIZING: SETTING UP THE RIGHT BUCKETS \nUsing the Calendar for Future Options \nYour calendar can be a very handy place to park rem inders of \nthings you might want  to consider doing in the future. Most of the \npeople I've coached were not nearly as comfortable with their cal- \nendars as they could have been; otherwise they prob ably would \nhave found many more things to put in there. \nOne of the three uses of a calendar is for day-specific informa- \ntion. This category can include a number of things, but o ne of the \nmost creative ways to utilize this function is to e nter things that \nyou want to take off your mind and reassess at some  later date. \nHere are a few of the myriad things you should cons ider inserting: \n• Triggers for activating projects \n• Events you might want to participate in \n• Decision catalysts \nTriggers for Activating Projects If you have a project that you \ndon't really need to think about now but that deser ves a flag at \nsome point in the future, you can pick an appropria te date and put \na reminder about the project in your calendar for t hat day. It \nshould go in some day-specific (versus time-specifi c) calendar slot \nfor the things you want to be reminded of on that d ay; then when \nthe day arrives, you see the reminder and insert th e item as an \nactive project on your \"Projects\" list. Typical can didates for this \ntreatment are: \n• Special events with a certain lead time for handlin g (product \nlaunches, fund-raising drives, etc.) \n• Regular events that you need to prepare for, such a s budget \nreviews, annual conferences, planning events, or me etings (e.g., \nwhen should you add next year's \"annual sales confe rence\" to \nyour \"Projects\" list?) \n• Key dates for significant people that you might wan t to do some- \nthing about (birthdays, anniversaries, holiday gift -giving, etc.) \n171 \nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY I  PART TWO \nEvents You Might Want to Participate In You probably get notices \nconstantly about seminars, conferences, speeches, a nd social and \ncultural events that you may want to decide about a ttending as the \ntime gets closer. So figure out when that \"closer\" time is and put a \ntrigger in your calendar on the appropriate date—fo r example: \n\"Chamber of Commerce breakfast tomorrow?\" \n\"Tigers season tickets go on sale today\" \n\"PBS special on Australia tonight 8:00 P.M.\" \n\"Church BBQ next Saturday\" \nIf you can think of any jogs like these that you'd like to put \ninto your system, do it right now. \nDecision Catalysts    Once in a while there may be a significant \ndecision that you need to make but can't (or don't want to) make \nright away. That's fine, as long as you've conclude d that the addi- \ntional information you need has to come from an internal rather \nthan an external source (e.g., you need to sleep on it). \n(Obviously, external data you need in order to make  a \ndecision should go on your \"Next Actions\" or \"Wait-\ning For\" lists.) But in order to move to a level of  OK- \nness about not deciding, you'd better put out a safety \nnet that you can trust to get you to focus on the i ssue \nappropriately in the future. A calendar reminder ca n \nserve that purpose.* \nSome typical decision areas in this category includ e: \n• Hire/fire \n• Merge/acquire/sell/divest \n• Change job/career \n172 *If you're using a group-accessible calendar, you m ust maintain discretion about \nthese kinds of triggers. Digital calendars usually have \"private\" categorization \nfunctions you can use for entries",

Most of the \npeople I've coached were not nearly as comfortable with their cal- \nendars as they could have been; otherwise they prob ably would \nhave found many more things to put in there. \nOne of the three uses of a calendar is for day-specific informa- \ntion. This category can include a number of things, but o ne of the \nmost creative ways to utilize this function is to e nter things that \nyou want to take off your mind and reassess at some  later date. \nHere are a few of the myriad things you should cons ider inserting: \n• Triggers for activating projects \n• Events you might want to participate in \n• Decision catalysts \nTriggers for Activating Projects If you have a project that you \ndon't really need to think about now but that deser ves a flag at \nsome point in the future, you can pick an appropria te date and put \na reminder about the project in your calendar for t hat day. It \nshould go in some day-specific (versus time-specifi c) calendar slot \nfor the things you want to be reminded of on that d ay; then when \nthe day arrives, you see the reminder and insert th e item as an \nactive project on your \"Projects\" list. Typical can didates for this \ntreatment are: \n• Special events with a certain lead time",

Typical can didates for this \ntreatment are: \n• Special events with a certain lead time for handlin g (product \nlaunches, fund-raising drives, etc.) \n• Regular events that you need to prepare for, such a s budget \nreviews, annual conferences, planning events, or me etings (e.g., \nwhen should you add next year's \"annual sales confe rence\" to \nyour \"Projects\" list?) \n• Key dates for significant people that you might wan t to do some- \nthing about (birthdays, anniversaries, holiday gift -giving, etc.) \n171 \nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY I  PART TWO \nEvents You Might Want to Participate In You probably get notices \nconstantly about seminars, conferences, speeches, a nd social and \ncultural events that you may want to decide about a ttending as the \ntime gets closer. So figure out when that \"closer\" time is and put a \ntrigger in your calendar on the appropriate date—fo r example: \n\"Chamber of Commerce breakfast tomorrow?\" \n\"Tigers season tickets go on sale today\" \n\"PBS special on Australia tonight 8:00 P.M.\" \n\"Church BBQ next Saturday\" \nIf you can think of any jogs like these that you'd like to put \ninto your system, do it right now. \nDecision Catalysts    Once in a while there may be a significant \ndecision that you need to make but can't (or don't want to) make \nright away. That's fine, as long as you've conclude d that the addi- \ntional information you need has to come from an internal rather \nthan an external source (e.g., you need to sleep on it). \n(Obviously, external data you need in order to make  a \ndecision should go on your \"Next Actions\" or \"Wait-\ning For\" lists.) But in order to move to a level of  OK- \nness about not deciding, you'd better put out a safety \nnet that you can trust to get you to focus on the i ssue \nappropriately in the future. A calendar reminder ca n \nserve that purpose.* \nSome typical decision areas in this category includ e: \n• Hire/fire \n• Merge/acquire/sell",

    "text": "/divest \n• Change job/career \n172 *If you're using a group-accessible calendar, you m ust maintain discretion about \nthese kinds of triggers. Digital calendars usually have \"private\" categorization \nfunctions you can use for entries you don't necessa rily want everyone to see. It's OK to decide not \nto decide—as long \nas you have a \ndecide-not-to- \ndecide system. \nCHAPTER 7  |  ORGANIZING: SETTING UP THE RIGHT BUCKETS \nThis is a big topic to devote so little space to, I  know, but go \nahead and ask yourself, \"Is there any major decisio n for which I \nshould create a future trigger, so I can feel comfo rtable just 'hang- \ning out' with it for now?\" If there is, put some re minder in your \ncalendar to revisit the issue. \nThe \"Tickler\" File \nOne elegant way to manage nonactionable items that may need \nan action in the future is the \"tickler\" file.* A t hree-dimensional \nversion of a calendar, it allows you to hold physical reminders of \nthings that you want to see or remember—not now, bu t in the \nfuture. It can be an extremely functional tool, all owing you to in \neffect set up your own post office and \"mail\" thing s to yourself for \nreceipt on a designated future date. I myself have used a tickler file \nfor years and can't imagine being without it. \nEssentially the tickler is a simple file-folder sys tem that \nallows you to distribute paper and other physical r eminders in \nsuch a way that whatever you want to see on a parti cular date in \nthe future \"automatically\" shows up that day in you r in-basket. \nIf you have a secretary or assistant, you can entru st at least a \npart of this task to him or her, assuming that he/s he has some \nworking version of this or a similar system. Typica l examples \nwould be: \n• \"Hand me this agenda the morning of the day I have the \nmeeting.\" \n• \"Give this back to me on Monday to rethink, since i t applies to \na meeting on Wednesday.\" \n• \"Remind me about the Hong Kong trip two weeks ahead , and \nwe'll plan the logistics.\" \nThen every day of the week, that day's folder is pu lled and \nreviewed. \n*Also referred to as a \"suspense,\" \"bring forward,\"  or \"follow-up\" file. \n173 \n174 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY I  PART TWO \nWhile you can (and probably should) utilize staff t o handle \nas much of this as is appropriate, I recommend that , if you can \nintegrate it into your life-style, you maintain you r own tickler file. \nThere are many useful functions it can perform, at least some of \nwhich you may want to avail yourself of outside the  pale of your \nassistant's responsibilities. I use my tickler file  to manage my \ntravel tickets and confirmations; paper-based trave l directions, \nagendas, and maps; reminders of event notifications  that come in \nthe mail; information about \"might-want-to-buy\" kin ds of things \nI want to reconsider in the future; and so forth. \nBottom line: the tickler file demands only a one-se cond-per- \nday new behavior to make it work, and it has a payo ff value \nlogarithmically greater than the personal investmen t. \nSetting Up a Tickler File You need forty-three folders—thirty- \none daily files labeled \"1\" through \"31,\" and twelv e more labeled \nwith the names of the months of the year. The daily  files are kept \nin front, beginning with the file for tomorrow's da te (if today is \nOctober 5, then the first file would be \"6\"). The s ucceeding daily \nfiles represent the days of the rest of the month ( \"6\" through \n\"31\"). Behind the \"31\" file is the monthly file for  the next month \n(\"November\"), and behind that are the daily files \" 1\" though \"5.\" \nFollowing that are the rest of the monthly files (\" December\" \nthrough \"October\"). The next daily file is emptied into your in- \nbasket every day, and then the folder is refiled at  the back of the \ndailies (at which point, instead of October 6, it r epresents Novem- \nber 6). In the same way, when the next monthly file rea ches the \nfront (on October 31 after you empty the daily file , the \"Novem- \nber\" file will be the next one, with the daily file s",

Digital calendars usually have \"private\" categorization \nfunctions you can use for entries you don't necessa rily want everyone to see. It's OK to decide not \nto decide—as long \nas you have a \ndecide-not-to- \ndecide system. \nCHAPTER 7  |  ORGANIZING: SETTING UP THE RIGHT BUCKETS \nThis is a big topic to devote so little space to, I  know, but go \nahead and ask yourself, \"Is there any major decisio n for which I \nshould create a future trigger, so I can feel comfo rtable just 'hang- \ning out' with it for now?\" If there is, put some re minder in your \ncalendar to revisit the issue. \nThe \"Tickler\" File \nOne elegant way to manage nonactionable items that may need \nan action in the future is the \"tickler\" file.* A t hree-dimensional \nversion of a calendar, it allows you to hold physical reminders of \nthings that you want to see or remember—not now, bu t in the \nfuture. It can be an extremely functional tool, all owing you to in \neffect set up your own post office and \"mail\" thing s to yourself for \nreceipt on a designated future date. I myself have used a tickler file \nfor years and can't imagine being without it. \nEssentially the tickler is a simple file-folder sys tem that \nallows you to distribute paper and other physical r eminders in \nsuch a way that whatever you want to see on a parti cular date in \nthe future \"automatically\" shows up that day in you r in-basket. \nIf you have a secretary or assistant, you can entru st at least a \npart of this task to him or her, assuming that he/s he has some \nworking version of this or a similar system. Typica l examples \nwould be: \n• \"Hand me this agenda the morning of the day I have the \nmeeting.\" \n• \"Give this back to me on Monday to rethink, since i t applies to \na meeting on Wednesday.\" \n• \"Remind me about the Hong Kong trip two weeks ahead , and \nwe'll plan the logistics.\" \nThen every day of the week, that day's folder is pu",

Digital calendars usually have \"private\" categorization \nfunctions you can use for entries you don't necessa rily want everyone to see. It's OK to decide not \nto decide—as long \nas you have a \ndecide-not-to- \ndecide system. \nCHAPTER 7  |  ORGANIZING: SETTING UP THE RIGHT BUCKETS \nThis is a big topic to devote so little space to, I  know, but go \nahead and ask yourself, \"Is there any major decisio n for which I \nshould create a future trigger, so I can feel comfo rtable just 'hang- \ning out' with it for now?\" If there is, put some re minder in your \ncalendar to revisit the issue. \nThe \"Tickler\" File \nOne elegant way to manage nonactionable items that may need \nan action in the future is the \"tickler\" file.* A t hree-dimensional \nversion of a calendar, it allows you to hold physical reminders of \nthings that you want to see or remember—not now,",

I use my tickler file  to manage my \ntravel tickets and confirmations; paper-based trave l directions, \nagendas, and maps; reminders of event notifications  that come in \nthe mail; information about \"might-want-to-buy\" kin ds of things \nI want to reconsider in the future; and so forth. \nBottom line: the tickler file demands only a one-se cond-per- \nday new behavior to make it work, and it has a payo ff value \nlogarithmically greater than the personal investmen t. \nSetting Up a Tickler File You need forty-three folders—thirty- \none daily files labeled \"1\" through \"31,\" and twelv e more labeled \nwith the names of the months of the year. The daily  files are kept \nin front, beginning with the file for tomorrow's da te (if today is \nOctober 5, then the first file would be \"6\"). The s ucceeding daily \nfiles represent the days of the rest of the month ( \"6\" through \n\"31\"). Behind the \"31\" file is the monthly file for  the next month \n(\"November\"), and behind that are the daily files \" 1\" though \"5.\" \nFollowing that are the rest of the monthly files (\" December\" \nthrough \"October\"). The next daily file is emptied into your in- \nbasket every day, and then the folder is refiled at  the back of the \ndailies (at which point, instead of October 6, it r epresents Novem- \nber 6",

In the same way, when the next monthly file rea ches the \nfront (on October 31 after you empty the daily file , the \"Novem- \nber\" file will be the next one, with the daily file s \"1\" through \"31\" \nbehind it), it's emptied into the in-basket and ref iled at the back \nof the monthlies to represent November a year from now. This is a \n\"perpetual\" file, meaning that at any given time it  contains files for \nthe next thirty-one days and the next twelve months . \nThe big advantage of using file folders for your ti ckler system is \nthat they allow you to store actual documents (the form that needs \nFILE-FOLDER-STYLE SAMPLE SETUP (OCTOBER 5) \nto be filled out on a certain day, the memo that ne eds to be reviewed \nthen, the telephone note that needs action on a spe cific date, etc.). \nIn order for the system to work, you must update it  every \nday. If you forget to empty the daily file, you won 't trust the sys- \ntem to handle important data, and you'll have to ma nage those \nthings some other way. If you leave town (or don't access the file \non the weekend), you must be sure to check the fold ers for the \ndays you'll be away, before you go. \n175 \nCHAPTER 7  |  ORGANIZING: SETTING UP THE RIGHT BUCKETS \n176 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY |  PART TWO \nChecklists: Creative Reminders \nThe last topic in personal system organization that  deserves some \nattention is the care and feeding of checklists, th ose recipes of \npotential ingredients for projects, events, and areas of value, inter- \nest, and responsibility. \nThe most creative checklists are often generated at  the back \nend of a good consulting process with a team or com pany. Good \nones also show up as areas of focus for training st aff or hiring into \njob slots. \nWhen I'm clearing in-baskets with clients and revie wing \nother things they're concerned about, we often run across little \n\"Memos to Self\" like: \n• Exercise more regularly. \n• Make sure we have evaluation forms for each trainin g. \n• Spend more quality time with my kids. \n• Do more proactive planning for the division. \n• Maintain good morale with my team. \n• Ensure we are in alignment with corporate strategy.\n• Keep the client billing process up to date. \nWhat should you do with these \"fuzzier\" kinds of in ternal \ncommitments and areas of attention? \nFirst, Clarify Inherent Projects and Actions \nFor much of this kind of \"stuff,\" there is still a project and/or an \naction that needs to be defined. \"Exercise more reg ularly\" really \ntranslates for many people into \"Set up regular exe rcise program\" \n(project) and \"Call Sally for suggestions about per sonal trainers\" \n(real action step). In such cases, inherent projects and actions still \nneed to be clarified and organized into a personal system. \nBut there are some things that don't quite fit into that \ncategory. \nCHAPTER 7  I  ORGANIZING: SETTING UP THE RIGHT BUCKETS \nBlueprinting Key Areas of Work and Responsibility \nObjectives like \"Maintain good physical conditionin g\" or \"Physi- \ncal health and vitality\" may still need to be built  into some sort of \noverview checklist that will be reviewed regularly.  You have multi- \nple layers of outcomes and standards playing on you r psyche and \nyour choices at any point in time, and knowing what  those are, at \nall the different levels, is always a good idea. \nI suggested earlier that there are at least six lev els of your \n\"work\" that could be defined, and that each level d eserves its own \nacknowledgment and evaluation. A complete inventory  of every- \nthing you hold important and are committed to on ea ch of those \nlevels would represent an awesome checklist. It mig ht include: \n• Career goals \n• Service \n• Family \n• Relationships \n• Community \n• Health and energy \n• Financial resources \n• Creative expression \nAnd then moving down a level, within your job, you \nmight want some reminders of your key areas of resp onsibility, \nyour staff, your values, and so on. A list of these  might contain \npoints like: \n• Team morale \n• Processes \n• Timelines \n• Staff issues \n• Workload \n• Communication \n177 \nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY | PART TWO \nAll of these items could in turn be included on the  lists in \nyour personal system, as reminders to you,",

In the same way, when the next monthly file rea ches the \nfront (on October 31 after you empty the daily file , the \"Novem- \nber\" file will be the next one, with the daily file s \"1\" through \"31\" \nbehind it), it's emptied into the in-basket and ref iled at the back \nof the monthlies to represent November a year from now. This is a \n\"perpetual\" file, meaning that at any given time it  contains files for \nthe next thirty-one days and the next twelve months . \nThe big advantage of using file folders for your ti ckler system is \nthat they allow you to store actual documents (the form that needs \nFILE-FOLDER-STYLE SAMPLE SETUP (OCTOBER 5) \nto be filled out on a certain day, the memo that ne eds to be reviewed \nthen, the telephone note that needs action on a spe cific date, etc.). \nIn order for the system to work, you must update it  every \nday. If you forget to empty the daily file, you won 't trust the sys- \ntem to handle important data, and you'll have to ma nage those \nthings some other way. If you leave town (or don't access the file \non the weekend), you must be sure to check the fold ers for the \ndays you'll be away, before you go. \n175 \nCHAPTER 7  |  ORGANIZING: SETTING UP THE RIGHT BUCKETS \n176 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY |  PART TWO \nChecklists: Creative Reminders \nThe last topic in personal system organization that  deserves some \nattention is the care and feeding of checklists, th ose recipes of \npotential ingredients for projects, events, and areas of value, inter- \nest, and responsibility. \nThe most creative checklists are often generated at  the back \nend of a good consulting process with a team or com pany. Good \nones also show up as areas of focus for training st aff or hiring into \njob slots. \nWhen I'm clearing in-baskets with clients and revie wing \nother things they're concerned about, we often run across little \n\"Memos to Self\" like: \n• Exercise more regularly. \n• Make sure we have evaluation forms for each trainin g. \n• Spend more quality time with my kids. \n• Do more proactive",

In the same way, when the next monthly file rea ches the \nfront (on October 31 after you empty the daily file , the \"Novem- \nber\" file will be the next one, with the daily file s \"1\" through \"31\" \nbehind it), it's emptied into the in-basket and ref iled at the back \nof the monthlies to represent November a year from now. This is a \n\"perpetual\" file, meaning that at any given time it  contains files for \nthe next thirty-one days and the next twelve months . \nThe big advantage of using file folders for your ti ckler system is \nthat they allow you to store actual documents (the form that needs \nFILE-FOLDER-STYLE SAMPLE SETUP (OCTOBER 5) \nto be filled out on a certain day, the memo that ne eds to be reviewed \nthen, the telephone note that needs action on a spe cific date, etc.). \nIn order for the system to work, you must update it  every \nday. If you forget to empty the daily file, you won 't trust the sys- \ntem to handle important data, and you'll have to ma nage those \n",

In such cases, inherent projects and actions still \nneed to be clarified and organized into a personal system. \nBut there are some things that don't quite fit into that \ncategory. \nCHAPTER 7  I  ORGANIZING: SETTING UP THE RIGHT BUCKETS \nBlueprinting Key Areas of Work and Responsibility \nObjectives like \"Maintain good physical conditionin g\" or \"Physi- \ncal health and vitality\" may still need to be built  into some sort of \noverview checklist that will be reviewed regularly.  You have multi- \nple layers of outcomes and standards playing on you r psyche and \nyour choices at any point in time, and knowing what  those are, at \nall the different levels, is always a good idea. \nI suggested earlier that there are at least six lev els of your \n\"work\" that could be defined, and that each level d eserves its own \nacknowledgment and evaluation. A complete inventory  of every- \nthing you hold important and are committed to on ea ch of those \nlevels would represent an awesome checklist. It mig ht include: \n• Career goals \n• Service \n• Family \n• Relationships \n• Community \n• Health and energy \n• Financial resources \n• Creative expression \nAnd then moving down a level, within your job, you \nmight want some reminders of your key areas of resp onsibility, \nyour staff, your values, and so on. A list of these  might contain \npoints like: \n• Team morale \n• Processes \n• Timelines \n•",

You have multi- \nple layers of outcomes and standards playing on you r psyche and \nyour choices at any point in time, and knowing what  those are, at \nall the different levels, is always a good idea. \nI suggested earlier that there are at least six lev els of your \n\"work\" that could be defined, and that each level d eserves its own \nacknowledgment and evaluation. A complete inventory  of every- \nthing you hold important and are committed to on ea ch of those \nlevels would represent an awesome checklist. It mig ht include: \n• Career goals \n• Service \n• Family \n• Relationships \n• Community \n• Health and energy \n• Financial resources \n• Creative expression \nAnd then moving down a level, within your job,",

If you've been doing what y ou're doing for a \nlong time, and there's no pressure on you to change  in that area, \nyou probably need minimal external personal organiz ation to stay \non cruise control. You know when things must happen , and how \nto make them happen, and your system is fine, statu s quo. Often, \nthough, that's not the case. \nMany times you'll want some sort of checklist to he lp you \nmaintain a focus until you're more familiar with wh at you're \ndoing. If your CEO suddenly disappeared, for exampl e, and you \nhad instantly to fill his shoes, you'd need some ov erviews and \noutlines in front of you for a while to ensure that  you had all the \nmission-critical aspects of the job handled. And if  you've just been \nhired into a new position, with new responsibilitie s that are rela- \ntively unfamiliar to you, you'll want a framework o f control and \n, structure, if only for the first few months. \nThere have been times when I needed to make a list of areas \nthat I had to handle, temporarily, until things wer e under control. \nFor instance, when my wife and I decided to create a \nbrand-new   structure   for   a   business   we'd   been \ninvolved with for many years, I took on areas of \nresponsibility I'd never had to deal with before—\nnamely, accounting, computers, marketing, legal, an d \nadministration. For several months I needed to keep\na checklist of those responsibilities in front of m e to \nensure that I filled in the blanks everywhere and m anaged the \ntransition as well as I could. After the business g ot onto \"cruise \ncontrol\" to some degree, I no longer needed that li st. \n178 Checklists can be \nhighly useful to let \nyou know what you \ndon't need to be \nconcerned about. \nCHAPTER 7 |  ORGANIZING: SETTING UP THE RIGHT BUCKETS \nChecklists at All Levels \nBe open to creating any kind of checklist as the ur ge strikes you. \nThe possibilities are endless—from \"Core Life Value s\" to \"Things \nto Take Camping.\" Making lists, ad hoc, as they occ ur to you, is \none of the most powerful yet subtlest and simplest procedures \nthat you can install in your life. \nTo spark your creative thinking, here's a list of s ome of the \ntopics of checklists I've seen and used over the ye ars: \n• Personal Affirmations (i.e., personal value stateme nts) \n• Job Areas of Responsibility (key responsibility are as) \n• Travel Checklist (everything to take on or do befor e a trip) \n• Weekly Review (everything to review and/or update o n a weekly \nbasis) \n• Training Program Components (all the things to hand le when \nputting on an event, front to back) \n• Clients \n• Conference Checklist (everything to handle when put ting on a \nconference) \n• Focus Areas (key life roles and responsibilities) \n• Key People in My Life/Work (relationships to assess  regularly \nfor completion and opportunity development) \n• Organization Chart (key people and areas of output to manage \nand maintain) \n• Personal Development (things to evaluate regularly to ensure \npersonal balance and progress) \nGet comfortable with checklists, both ad hoc and mo re per- \nmanent. Be ready to create and eliminate them as re quired. \nAppropriately used, they can be a tremendous asset in personal \nproductivity. \nIf in fact you have now collected everything that represents an open \nloop in your life and work, processed each one of those items in \n179 \nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  |  PART TWO \nterms of what it means to you and what actions are required, and \norganized the results into a complete system that holds a cur rent \nand complete overview—large and small—of all your p resent \nand \n\"someday\" projects, then you're ready for the next phase of imple- \nmentation in the art of stress-free productivity—th e review \nprocess. \\\n180",

If you've been doing what y ou're doing for a \nlong time, and there's no pressure on you to change  in that area, \nyou probably need minimal external personal organiz ation to stay \non cruise control. You know when things must happen , and how \nto make them happen, and your system is fine, statu s quo. Often, \nthough, that's not the case. \nMany times you'll want some sort of checklist to he lp you \nmaintain a focus until you're more familiar with wh at you're \ndoing. If your CEO suddenly disappeared, for exampl e, and you \nhad instantly to fill his shoes, you'd need some ov erviews and \noutlines in front of you for a while to ensure that  you had all the \nmission-critical aspects of the job handled. And if  you've just been \nhired into a new position, with new responsibilitie s that are rela- \ntively unfamiliar to you, you'll want a framework o f control and \n, structure, if only for the first few months. \nThere have been times when I needed to make a list of areas \nthat I had to handle, temporarily, until things wer e under control. \nFor instance, when my wife and I decided to create a \nbrand-new   structure   for   a   business   we'd   been \ninvolved with for many years, I took on areas of \nresponsibility I'd never had to deal with before—\nnamely, accounting, computers, marketing, legal, an d \nadministration. For several months I needed to keep\na checklist of those responsibilities in front of m e to \nensure that I filled in the blanks everywhere and m anaged the \ntransition as well as I could. After the business g ot onto \"cruise \ncontrol\" to some degree, I no longer needed that li st. \n",
