No matter what the setting, there are fiv e discrete \nstages that we go through as we deal with our work.  We (1) collect \nthings that command our attention; (2) process what they mean \nand what to do about them; and (3) organize the results, which we \n(4) review as options for what we choose to (5) do. \nThis constitutes the management of the \"horizontal\"\naspect of our lives—incorporating everything that \nhas our attention at any time. \nThe method is straightforward enough in princi- \nple, and it is generally how we all go about our wo rk in \nany case, but in my experience most people can stan d \nsignificantly to improve their handling of each one  of \nthe five stages. The quality of our workflow manage - \nment is only as good as the weakest link in this fi ve- \nphase chain, so all the links must be integrated \ntogether and supported with consistent standards. \nMost people have major leaks in their collection \nprocess. Many have collected things but haven't \nprocessed or decided what action to take about them. Others m ake \ngood decisions about \"stuff\" in the moment but lose  the value of \nthat thinking because they don't efficiently organize the results. Still \nothers have good systems but don't review them consistently \nenough to keep them functional. Finally, if any one  of these links is \n24 The knowledge \nthat we consider \nknowledge proves \nitself in action. \nWhat we now \nmean by \nknowledge is \ninformation in \naction, \ninformation \nfocused on results. \n—Peter F.

I have found it very h elpful, if not \nessential, to separate these stages as I move throu gh my day. There \nare times when I want only to collect input and not  decide what to \ndo with it yet. At other times I may just want to p rocess my notes \nfrom a meeting. Or I may have just returned from a big trip and \nneed to distribute and organize what I collected an d processed on \nthe road. Then there are times when I want to revie w the whole \ninventory of my work, or some portion of it. And ob viously a lot \nof my time is spent merely doing something that I n eed to get \ndone. \nI have discovered that one of the major reasons man y people \nhaven't had a lot of success with \"getting organize d\" is simply that \nthey have tried to do all five phases at one time. Most, when they \nsit down to \"make a list,\" are trying to collect th e \"most important \nthings\" in some order that reflects priorities and sequences, with- \nout setting out many (or any) real actions to take.  But if you don't \ndecide what needs to be done about your secretary's  birthday, \nbecause it's \"not that important\" right now, that o pen loop will \ntake up energy and prevent you from having a totall y effective, \nclear focus on what is important. \nThis chapter explains the five phases in detail. Ch apters 4 \nthrough 8 provide a step-by-step program for implem enting an \nairtight system for each phase, with lots of exampl es and best \npractices. \nCollect \nIt's important to know what needs to be collected a nd how to col- \nlect it most effectively so you can process it appr opriately.

No matter what the setting, there are fiv e discrete \nstages that we go through as we deal with our work.  We (1) collect \nthings that command our attention; (2) process what they mean \nand what to do about them; and (3) organize the results, which we \n(4) review as options for what we choose to (5) do. \nThis constitutes the management of the \"horizontal\"\naspect of our lives—incorporating everything that \nhas our attention at any time. \nThe method is straightforward enough in princi- \nple, and it is generally how we all go about our wo rk in \nany case, but in my experience most people can stan d \nsignificantly to improve their handling of each one  of \nthe five stages. The quality of our workflow manage - \nment is only as good as the weakest link in this fi ve- \nphase chain, so all the links must be integrated \ntogether and supported with consistent standards. \nMost people have major leaks in their collection \nprocess. Many have collected things but haven't \nprocessed or decided what action to take about them. Others m ake \ngood decisions about \"stuff\" in the moment but lose  the value of \nthat thinking because they don't efficiently organize the results. Still \nothers have good systems but don't review them consistently \nenough to keep them functional.

We (1) collect \nthings that command our attention; (2) process what they mean \nand what to do about them; and (3) organize the results, which we \n(4) review as options for what we choose to (5) do. \nThis constitutes the management of the \"horizontal\"\naspect of our lives—incorporating everything that \nhas our attention at any time. \nThe method is straightforward enough in princi- \nple, and it is generally how we all go about our wo rk in \nany case, but in my experience most people can stan d \nsignificantly to improve their handling of each one  of \nthe five stages. The quality of our workflow manage - \nment is only as good as the weakest link in this fi ve- \nphase chain, so all the links must be integrated \ntogether and supported with consistent standards",

Mail is coming into your mailbox,  memos are \nbeing routed to your in-basket, e-mail is being fun neled into your \ncomputer, and messages are accumulating on your voi ce-mail. But \nat the same time, you've been \"collecting\" things i n your environ- \nment and in your psyche that don't belong where the y are, the way \nthey are, for all eternity. Even though it may not be as obviously \n\"in your face\" as your e-mail, this \"stuff\" still r equires some kind \nof resolution—a loop to be closed, something to be done. Strategy \nideas loitering on a legal pad in a stack on your c redenza, \"dead\" \ngadgets in your desk drawers that need to be fixed or thrown away, \nand out-of-date magazines on your coffee table all fall into this \ncategory of \"stuff.\" \nAs soon as you attach a \"should,\" \"need to,\" or \"ou ght to\" to \nan item, it becomes an incomplete. Decisions you st ill need to \nmake about whether or not you are going to do somet hing, for \nexample, are already incompletes. This includes all  of your \"I'm \ngoing to\"s, where you've decided to do something bu t haven't \nstarted moving on it yet. And it certainly includes  all pending and \nin-progress items, as well as those things on which  you've done \neverything you're ever going to do except acknowled ge that you're \nfinished with them. \nIn order to manage this inventory of open loops app ropri- \nCHAPTER 2  |  GETTING CONTROL OF YOUR LIFE: THE FIVE STAGES OF  MASTERING WORKFLOW \nately, you need to capture it into \"containers\" tha t hold items in \nabeyance until you have a few moments to decide wha t they are \nand what, if anything, you're going to do about the m. Then you \nmust empty these containers regularly to ensure tha t they remain \nviable collection tools. \nBasically, everything is already being collected, i n the larger \nsense. If it's not being directly managed in a trus ted external sys- \ntem of yours, then it's resident somewhere in your psyche. The fact \nthat you haven't put an item in your in-basket does n't mean you \nhaven't got it. But we're talking here about making sure that e very- \nthing you need is collected somewhere other than in your head. \nThe Collection Tools \nThere are several types of tools, both low- and hig h-tech, that can \nbe used to collect your incompletes. The following can all serve as \nversions of an in-basket, capturing self-generated input as well as \ninformation coming from outside: \n• Physical in-basket \n• Paper-based note-taking devices \n• Electronic note-taking devices \n• Voice-recording devices \n• E-mail \nThe Physical In-Basket \nThe standard plastic, wood, leather, or wire tray i s the most com- \nmon tool for collecting paper-based materials and a nything else \nphysical that needs some sort of processing: mail, magazines, \nmemos, notes, phone slips, receipts—even flashlight s with dead \nbatteries. \nWriting Paper and Pads \nLoose-leaf notebooks, spiral binders, and steno and  legal pads all \nwork fine for collecting random ideas, input, thing s to do, and so \non. Whatever kind fits your taste and needs is fine . \n27 \n28 THE ART OF GETTING THINGS DONE  I  PART ONE \nElectronic Note-Taking \nComputers can be used to type in notes for processi ng later. And \nas character-recognition technology advances, a par ade of digital \ntools designed to capture data continues to be intr oduced. Hand- \nheld devices (personal digital assistants, or PDAs)  and electronic \nlegal pads can both be used to collect all kinds of  input. \nAuditory Capture \nAvailable auditory devices include answering machin es, voice- \nmail, and dictating equipment, such as digital or m icrocassette \nrecorders. All of these can be useful for preservin g an interim \nrecord of things you need to remember or deal with.\nE-mail \nIf you're wired to the rest of the world through e- mail, your \nsoftware contains some",

    "text": " WORKFLOW \nately, you need to capture it into \"containers\" tha t hold items in \nabeyance until you have a few moments to decide wha t they are \nand what, if anything, you're going to do about the m. Then you \nmust empty these containers regularly to ensure tha t they remain \nviable collection tools. \nBasically, everything is already being collected, i n the larger \nsense. If it's not being directly managed in a trus ted external sys- \ntem of yours, then it's resident somewhere in your psyche. The fact \nthat you haven't put an item in your in-basket does n't mean you \nhaven't got it. But we're talking here about making sure that e very- \nthing you need is collected somewhere other than in your head. \nThe Collection Tools \nThere are several types of tools, both low- and hig h-tech, that can \nbe used to collect your incompletes. The following can all serve as \nversions of an in-basket, capturing self-generated input as well as \ninformation coming from outside: \n• Physical in-basket \n• Paper-based note-taking devices \n• Electronic note-taking devices \n• Voice-recording devices \n• E-mail \nThe Physical In-Basket \nThe standard plastic, wood, leather, or wire tray i s the most com- \nmon tool for collecting paper-based materials and a nything else \nphysical that needs some sort of processing: mail, magazines, \nmemos, notes, phone slips, receipts—even flashlight s with dead \nbatteries. \nWriting Paper and Pads \nLoose-leaf notebooks, spiral binders, and steno and  legal pads all \nwork fine for collecting random ideas, input, thing s to do, and so \non. Whatever kind fits your taste and needs is fine . \n27 \n28 THE ART OF GETTING THINGS DONE  I  PART ONE \nElectronic Note-Taking \nComputers can be used to type in notes for processi ng later. And \nas character-recognition technology advances, a par ade of digital \ntools designed to capture data continues to be intr oduced. Hand- \nheld devices (personal digital assistants, or PDAs)  and electronic \nlegal pads can both be used to collect all kinds of  input. \nAuditory Capture \nAvailable auditory devices include answering machin es, voice- \nmail, and dictating equipment, such as digital or m icrocassette \nrec",

All of these can be useful for preservin g an interim \nrecord of things you need to remember or deal with.\nE-mail \nIf you're wired to the rest of the world through e- mail, your \nsoftware contains some sort of holding area for inc oming mes- \nsages and files, where they can be stored until the y are viewed, \nread, and processed. Pagers and telephones can capt ure this kind \nof input as well. \nHigher-Tech Devices \nNow you can dictate into computers as well as hand- write into \nthem. As more and more communication is morphed int o digital \nand wireless formats, it will become easier to capt ure ideas (with a \ncorresponding increase in the amount of data reachi ng us that we \nneed to manage!). \n\"Computer!\" \n\"Yes, David?\" \n\"I need bread.\" \n\"Yes, David.\" \nMy needed grocery item has been collected. And as the orga- \nnizing part of the action-management process is further di gitized, \n\"bread\" will automatically be added to my electroni c grocery list, \nand maybe even ordered and delivered. \nCHAPTER 2  |  GETTING CONTROL OF YOUR LIFE: THE FIVE STAGES OF  MASTERING WORKFLOW \nWhether high-tech or low-tech, all of the tools des cribed above \nserve as similar in-baskets, capturing potentially useful informa- \ntion, commitments, and agreements for action. You'r e probably \nalready using some version of most of them. \nThe Collection Success Factors \nUnfortunately, merely having an in-basket doesn't m ake it func- \ntional. Most people do have collection devices of some sort, but \nusually they're more or less out of control. Let's examine the three \nrequirements to make the collection phase work: \n1 |   Every open loop must be in your collection sys tem and out \nof your head. \n2 |   You must have as few collection buckets as you can get by with. \n3 |   You must empty them regularly. \nGet It All Out of Your Head \nIf you're still trying to keep track of too many th ings in your RAM, \nyou likely won't be motivated to use and empty your  in-baskets \nwith integrity. Most people are relatively careless  about these tools \nbecause they know they don't represent discrete, wh ole systems \nanyway: there's an incomplete set of things in thei r in-basket and \nan incomplete set in their mind, and they're not ge tting any payoff \nfrom either one, so their thinking goes. It's like trying to play pin- \nball on a machine that has big holes in the table, so the balls keep \nfalling out: there's little motivation to keep play ing the game. \nThese collection tools should become part of your l ife-style. \nKeep them close by so no matter where you are you c an collect a \npotentially valuable thought-—think of them as bein g as indis- \npensable as your toothbrush or your driver's licens e or your glasses. \nMinimize the Number of Collection Buckets \nYou should have as many in-baskets as you need and as few as you \ncan get by with. You need this function to be avail able to you in \n29 \nTHE ART OF GETTING THINGS DONE  I  PART ONE \nevery context, since things you'll want to capture may show up \nalmost anywhere. If you have too many collection zo nes, however, \nyou won't be able to process them easily or consist ently. \nAn excess of collection buckets is seldom a problem  on the \nhigh-tech end; the real improvement opportunity for  most people \nis on the low-tech side, primarily in the areas of note-taking and \nphysical in-basket collection. Written notes need t o be corralled \nand processed instead of left lying embedded in sta cks, note- \nbooks, and drawers. Paper materials need to be funn eled into \nphysical in-baskets instead of being scattered over  myriad piles in \nall the available corners of your world. \nImplementing   standard   tools   for   capturing \nideas and input will become more and more critical \nas your life and work become more sophisticated. As\nyou proceed in your career, for instance, you'll pr oba- \nbly notice that your best ideas about work will not\ncome to you at work. The ability to leverage that \nthinking with good collection devices th \nat hand is key to increased productivity. \n30 Empty the Buckets Regularly \nThe final success factor for collecting should be obvious: if you \ndon't empty and process the \"stuff\" you've collecte d, your buckets \naren't serving any function other than the storage of amorphous \nmaterial. Emptying the bucket does not mean that yo u have to \nfinish",

All of these can be useful for preservin g an interim \nrecord of things you need to remember or deal with.\nE-mail \nIf you're wired to the rest of the world through e- mail, your \nsoftware contains some sort of holding area for inc oming mes- \nsages and files, where they can be stored until the y are viewed, \nread, and processed. Pagers and telephones can capt ure this kind \nof input as well. \nHigher-Tech Devices \nNow you can dictate into computers as well as hand- write into \nthem. As more and more communication is morphed int o digital \nand wireless formats, it will become easier to capt ure ideas (with a \ncorresponding increase in the amount of data reachi ng us that we \nneed to manage!). \n\"Computer!\" \n\"Yes, David?\" \n\"I need bread.\" \n\"Yes, David.\" \nMy needed grocery item has been collected.

You'r e probably \nalready using some version of most of them. \nThe Collection Success Factors \nUnfortunately, merely having an in-basket doesn't m ake it func- \ntional. Most people do have collection devices of some sort, but \nusually they're more or less out of control. Let's examine the three \nrequirements to make the collection phase work: \n1 |   Every open loop must be in your collection sys tem and out \nof your head. \n2 |   You must have as few collection buckets as you can get by with. \n3 |   You must empty them regularly. \nGet It All Out of Your Head \nIf you're still trying to keep track of too many th ings in your RAM, \nyou likely won't be motivated to use and empty your  in-baskets \nwith integrity. Most people are relatively careless  about these tools \nbecause they know they don't represent discrete, wh ole systems \nanyway: there's an incomplete set of things in",

Most people are relatively careless  about these tools \nbecause they know they don't represent discrete, wh ole systems \nanyway: there's an incomplete set of things in thei r in-basket and \nan incomplete set in their mind, and they're not ge tting any payoff \nfrom either one, so their thinking goes. It's like trying to play pin- \nball on a machine that has big holes in the table, so the balls keep \nfalling out: there's little motivation to keep play ing the game. \nThese collection tools should become part of your l ife-style. \nKeep them close by so no matter where you are you c an collect a \npotentially valuable thought-—think of them as bein g as indis- \npensable as your toothbrush or your driver's licens e or your glasses. \nMinimize the Number of Collection Buckets \nYou should have as many in-baskets as you need and as few as you \ncan get by with.

Emptying the bucket does not mean that yo u have to \nfinish what's in your voice-mail, e-mail, or in-basket; it  just means \nyou have to take it out of the container, decide wh at it is and what \nshould be done with it, and, if it's still unfinish ed, organize it into \nyour system. You don't put it back into \"in\"! Not e mptying your \nin-basket is like having garbage cans that nobody e ver dumps—\nyou just have to keep buying new ones to hold all y our trash. \nIn order for you to get \"in\" to empty, your total a ction- \nmanagement system must be in place. Too much \"stuff \" is left \npiled in in-baskets because of a lack of effective systems \"down- \nstream\" from there. It often seems easier to leave things in \"in\" Men of lofty genius \n•when they are \ndoing the least \n•work are the most \nactive. \n—\nLeonar \nCHAPTER 2  |  GETTING CONTROL OF YOUR LIFE: THE FIVE STAGES OF  MASTERING WORKFLOW \nwhen you know you have to do something about them b ut can't \ndo it right then. The in-basket, especially for pap er and e-mail, is \nthe best that many people can do in terms of organi zation—at \nleast they know that somewhere in there is a reminder of some- \nthing they still have to do. Unfortunately, that sa fety net is lost \nwhen the piles get out of control or the inventory of e-mails gets \ntoo extensive to be viewed on one screen. \nWhen you master the next phase and know how to proc ess \nyour incompletes easily and rapidly, \"in\" can retur n to its original \nfunction. Let's move on to how to get those in-bask ets and e-mail \nsystems empty without necessarily having to do the work now. \nProcess \nTeaching them the item-by-item thinking required to  get their \ncollection buckets empty is perhaps the most critic al improve- \nment I have made for virtually all the people I've worked with. \nWhen the head of a major department in a global cor poration had \nfinished processing all her open items with me, she  sat back in \nawe and told me that though she had been able to re lax about \nwhat meetings to go to thanks to her trust in her c alendar, she had \nnever felt that same relief about all the many othe r aspects of her \njob, which we had just clarified together. The acti ons and infor- \nmation she needed to be reminded of were now identi fied and \nentrusted to a concrete system. \nWhat do you need to ask yourself (and answer) about  each \ne-mail, voice-mail, memo, or self-generated idea th at comes your \nway? This is the component of action management tha t forms the \nbasis for your personal organization. Many people t ry to \"get \norganized\" but make the mistake of doing it with in complete \nbatches of \"stuff.\" You can't organize what's incom ing—you can \nonly collect it and process it. Instead, you organi ze the actions \nyou'll need to take based on the decisions you've m ade about \nwhat needs to be done.

For now, though, I sug gest you select \na to-do list or a pile of papers from your in-baske t and assess a few \nitems as we take an overview. \nWhat Is It? \nThis is not a dumb question. We've talked about \"st uff.\" And we've \ntalked about collection buckets. But we haven't dis cussed what \nstuff is and what to do about it. For example, many of the i tems \nthat tend to leak out of our personal organizing sy stems are amor- \nphous forms that we receive from the government or from our \ncompany—do we actually need to do something about them?

Emptying the bucket does not mean that yo u have to \nfinish what's in your voice-mail, e-mail, or in-basket; it  just means \nyou have to take it out of the container, decide wh at it is and what \nshould be done with it, and, if it's still unfinish ed, organize it into \nyour system. You don't put it back into \"in\"! Not e mptying your \nin-basket is like having garbage cans that nobody e ver dumps—\nyou just have to keep buying new ones to hold all y our trash. \nIn order for you to get \"in\" to empty, your total a ction- \nmanagement system must be in place. Too much \"stuff \" is left \npiled in in-baskets because of a lack of effective systems \"down- \nstream\" from there.

    "text": " to do something about them? And \nwhat about that e-mail from human resources, lettin g us know \nthat blah-blah about the blah-blah is now the polic y of blah-blah? \nI've unearthed piles of messages in stacks and desk  drawers that \nwere tossed there because the client didn't take ju st a few seconds \nto figure out what in fact the communication or doc ument was \nreally about. Which is why the next decision is cri tical. \nIs It Actionable? \nThere are two possible answers for this: YES and NO .\nNo Action Required If the answer is NO , there are three possibili- \nties: \n1   |   It's trash, no longer needed. \n2   |   No action is needed now, but something migh t need to be \ndone later (incubate). \n3  |   The item is potentially useful information t hat might be \nneeded for something later (reference). \nThese three categories can themselves be managed; w e'll get \ninto that in a later chapter. For now, suffice it t o say that you need \n33 \nTHE ART OF GETTING THINGS DONE  |  PART ONE \na trash basket and <Del> key for trash, a \"tickler\"  file or calendar \nfor material that's incubating, and a good filing s ystem for refer- \nence information. \nActionable This is the YES group of items, stuff about which \nsomething needs to be done. Typical examples range from \nan e-mail requesting your participation in a corpor ate service \nproject on such-and-such a date to the notes in you r in-basket \nfrom your face-to-face meeting with the group vice president \nabout a significant new project that involves hirin g an outside \nconsultant. \nTwo things need to be determined about each actiona ble item: \n1 |   What \"project\" or outcome have you committed to ? and \n2 |   What's the next action required? \nIf It's About a Project. . . You need to capture that outcome on a \n\"Projects\" list. That will be the stake in the grou nd that reminds \nyou that you have an open loop. A Weekly Review of the list (see \npage 46) will bring this item back to you as someth ing that's still \noutstanding. It will stay fresh and alive in your m anagement sys- \ntem until it is completed or eliminated. \nWhat's the Next Action? This is the critical question \nfor anything you've collected; if you answer it app ro- \npriately, you'll have the key substantive thing to orga- \nnize. The \"next action\" is the next physical, visib le \nactivity that needs to be engaged in, in order to m ove \nthe current reality toward completion. \nSome examples of next actions might be: \n34 • Call Fred re tel. # for the garage he recommended. \n• Draft thoughts for the budget-meeting agenda. \n• Talk to Angela about the filing system we need to s et up. \n• Research database-management software on the Web. It does not take \nmuch strength to \ndo things, but it \nrequires a great \ndeal of strength to \ndecide what to do. \n—Elbert \nCHAPTER 2  |  GETTING CONTROL OF YOUR LIFE: THE FIVE STAGES OF  MASTERING WORKFLOW \nThese are all real physical activities that need to  happen. \nReminders of these will become the primary grist fo r the mill of \nyour personal productivity-management system. \nDo It, Delegate It, or Defer It    Once you've decided on the next \naction, you have three options: \n1 |   Do it. If an action will take less than two minutes, it sh ould \nbe done at the moment it is defined. \n2 |   Delegate it. If the action will take longer than two minutes, \nask yourself, Am I the right person to do this? If the answer \nis no, delegate it to the appropriate entity. \n3 |   Defer it. If the action will take longer than two minutes, an d \nyou are the right person to do it, you will have to  defer acting \non it until later and track it on one or more \"Next  Actions\" \nlists. \nOrganize \nThe outer ring of the workflow diagram shows the ei ght discrete \ncategories of reminders and materials that will res ult from your \nprocessing all your \"stuff.\" Together they make up a total system \nfor organizing just about everything that's on your  plate, or could \nbe added to it, on a daily and weekly basis. \nFor nonactionable items, the possible categories ar e trash, \nincubation tools, and reference storage. If no action is needed on \nsomething, you toss it, \"tickle\" it for later",

And \nwhat about that e-mail from human resources, lettin g us know \nthat blah-blah about the blah-blah is now the polic y of blah-blah? \nI've unearthed piles of messages in stacks and desk  drawers that \nwere tossed there because the client didn't take ju st a few seconds \nto figure out what in fact the communication or doc ument was \nreally about. Which is why the next decision is cri tical. \nIs It Actionable? \nThere are two possible answers for this: YES and NO .\nNo Action Required If the answer is NO , there are three possibili- \nties: \n1   |   It's trash, no longer needed. \n2   |   No action is needed now, but something migh t need to be \ndone later (incubate). \n3  |   The item is potentially useful information t hat might be \nneeded for something later (reference). \nThese three categories can themselves be managed; w e'll get \ninto that in a later chapter. For now, suffice it t o say that you need \n33 \nTHE ART OF GETTING THINGS DONE  |  PART ONE \na trash basket and <Del> key for trash, a \"tickler\"  file or calendar \nfor material that's incubating, and a good filing s ystem for refer- \nence information. \nActionable This is the YES group of items, stuff about which \nsomething needs to be done. Typical examples range from \nan e-mail requesting your participation in a corpor ate service \nproject on such-and-such a date to the notes in you r in-basket \nfrom your face-to-face meeting with the group vice president \nabout a significant new project that involves hirin g an outside \nconsultant. \nTwo things need to be determined about each actiona ble item: \n1 |   What \"project\" or outcome have you committed to ? and \n2 |   What's the next action required? \nIf It's About a Project. . . You need to capture that outcome on a \n\"Projects\" list. That will be the stake in the grou nd that reminds \nyou that you have an open loop.

If no action is needed on \nsomething, you toss it, \"tickle\" it for later reass essment, or file it so \nyou can find the material if you need to refer to i t at another time. \nTo manage actionable things, you will need a list of projects, storage \nor files for project plans and materials, a calendar, a list of reminders of \nnext actions, and a list of reminders of things you're waiting for. \nAll of the organizational categories need to be phy sically \ncontained in some form. When I refer to \"lists,\" I just mean \nsome sort of reviewable set of reminders, which cou ld be lists on \n35 \n36 THE ART OF GETTING THINGS DONE  |  PART ONE \nWORKFLOW DIAGRAM—ORGANIZING \n\nCHAPTER 2  |  GETTING CONTROL OF YOUR LIFE: THE FIVE STAGES OF  MASTERING WORKFLOW \nnotebook paper or in some computer program or even file folders \nholding separate pieces of paper for each item. For  instance, the \nlist of current projects could be kept on a page in  a Day Runner; it \ncould be a \"To Do\" category on a PDA; or it could b e in a file \nlabeled \"Projects List.\" Incubating reminders (such  as \"after \nMarch 1 contact my accountant to set up a meeting\")  may be \nstored in a paper-based \"tickler\" file or in a pape r- or computer- \nbased calendar program. \nProjects \nI define a project as any desired result that requires more than one \naction step. This means that some rather small thin gs that you \nmight not normally call projects are going to be on  your \"Projects\" \nlist. The reasoning behind my definition is that if  one step won't \ncomplete something, some kind of stake needs to be placed in the \nground to remind you that there's something still l eft to do. If \nyou don't have a placeholder to remind you about it , it will slip \nback into RAM. Another way to think of this is as a  list of open \nloops. \nA Partial \"Projects\"List \nGet new staff person on board R&D joint-venture vide o project\nAugust vacation Produce new training compact disk \nStaff off-site retreat Establish next year's seminar  schedule \nPublish book Orchestrate a one-hour keynote \nFinalize computer upgrades      . presentation \nUpdate will Get proficient with videoconferencing \nFinalize budgets access \nFinalize new product line Finalize employment agreem ents \nGet comfortable with new contact- Install new backya rd lights \nmanagement software Establish formal relationships w ith South \nGet reprints of Fortune article American rep \nGet a publicist Finalize staff policies and procedur es \nFinish new orchard planting Get a new living-room ch air \n37 \n38 THE ART OF GETTING THINGS DONE  |  PART ONE \nProjects do not need to be listed in any particular  order, \nwhether by size or by priority. They just need to b e on a master list \nso you can review them regularly enough to ensure t hat appropri- \nate next actions have been defined for each of them . \nYou don't actually do a project; you can only do action steps \nrelated to it. When enough of the right action steps have b een \ntaken, some situation will have been created that m atches your \ninitial picture of the outcome closely enough that you can call \nit \"done.\" The list of projects is the compilation of finish lines \nwe put before us, to keep our next actions moving o n all tracks \nappropriately. \nProject Support Material \nFor many of your projects, you will accumulate rele vant informa- \ntion that you will want to organize by theme or top ic or project \nname. Your \"Projects\" list will be merely an index.  All of the \ndetails, plans, and supporting information that you  may need as \nyou work on your various projects should be contain ed in separate \nfile folders, computer files, notebooks, or binders . \nSupport Materials and Reference Files Once you have organized \nyour project support material by theme or topic, yo u will probably \nfind that it is almost identical to your reference material and could \nbe kept in the same reference file system (a \"Weddi ng\" file \ncould be kept in the general-reference files, for i nstance). The \nonly difference is that in the case of active proje cts, support mate- \nrial may need to be reviewed on a more consistent b asis to ensure \nthat all the necessary action steps are identified.\nI usually recommend that people store their support  materi- \nals out of sight.

They just need to b e on a master list \nso you can review them regularly enough to ensure t hat appropri- \nate next actions have been defined for each of them . \nYou don't actually do a project; you can only do action steps \nrelated to it. When enough of the right action steps have b een \ntaken, some situation will have been created that m atches your \ninitial picture of the outcome closely enough that you can call \nit \"done.\" The list of projects is the compilation of finish lines \nwe put before us, to keep our next actions moving o n all tracks \nappropriately. \nProject Support Material \nFor many of your projects, you will accumulate rele vant informa- \ntion that you will want to organize by theme or top ic or project \nname. Your \"Projects\" list will be merely an index.  All of the \ndetails, plans, and supporting information that you  may need as \nyou work on your various projects should be contain ed in separate \nfile folders, computer files, notebooks, or binders . \nSupport Materials and Reference Files Once you have organized \nyour project support material by theme or topic, yo u will probably \nfind that it is almost identical to your reference material and could \nbe kept in the same reference file system (a \"Weddi ng\" file \ncould be kept in the general-reference files, for i nstance). The \nonly difference is that in the case of active proje cts, support mate- \nrial may need to be reviewed",

If you have a good working refere nce file system \nclose enough at hand, you may find that that's the simplest way to \norganize them. There will be times, though, when it 'll be more \nconvenient to have the materials out and instantly in view and \navailable, especially if you're working on a hot pr oject that you \nneed to check references for several times during t he day. File \nCHAPTER 2  |  GETTING CONTROL OF YOUR LIFE: THE FIVE STAGES OF  MASTERING WORKFLOW \nfolders in wire standing holders or in stackable tr ays within easy \nreach can be practical for this kind of \"pending\" p aperwork. \nThe Next-Action Categories \nAs the Workflow Diagram makes clear, the next-actio n decision \nis central. That action needs to be the next physic al, visible behav- \nior, without exception, on every open loop. \nAny less-than-two-minute actions that you perform, and all \nother actions that have already been completed, do not, of course, \nneed to be tracked; they're done. What does need to be tracked is \nevery action that has to happen at a specific time or on a specific \nday (enter these in your calendar); those that need  to be done as \nsoon as they can (add these to your \"Next Actions\" lists); and all \nthose that you are waiting for others to do (put th ese on a \"Wait- \ning For\" list). \nCalendar \nReminders of actions you need to take fall into two  categories: \nthose about things that have to happen on a specifi c day or time, \nand those about things that just need to get done a s soon as possi- \nble. Your calendar handles the first type of remind er. \nThree things go on your calendar: \n• time-specific actions; \n• day-specific actions; and \n• day-specific information. \nTime-Specific Actions This is a fancy name for appointments. \nOften the next action to be taken on a project is a ttending a meet- \ning that has been set up to discuss it. Simply trac king that on the \ncalendar is sufficient. \nDay-Specific Actions These are things that you need to do some- \ntime on a certain day, but not necessarily at a specific time. Perhaps \nyou told Mioko you would call her on Friday to chec k that the \n39 \nTHE ART OF GETTING THINGS DONE  I  PART ONE \nreport you're sending her is OK. She won't have the  report until \nThursday, and she's leaving the country on Saturday , so Friday is \nthe time window for taking the action—but anytime F riday will \nbe fine. That should be tracked on the calendar for  Friday but not \ntied to any particular time slot—it should just go on the day. \nIt's \nuseful to have a calendar on which you can note bot h time- \nspecific and day-specific actions. \nDay-Specific Information The calendar is also the place to keep \ntrack of things you want to know about on specific days—not nec- \nessarily actions you'll have to take but rather information that may \nbe useful on a certain date. This might include dir ections for \nappointments, activities that other people (family or staff) will be \ninvolved in then, or events of interest. It's also helpful to put \nshort-term \"tickler\" information here, too, such as  a reminder to \ncall someone after the day they return from a vacat ion. \nNo More \"Daily To-Do\" Lists   Those three things are what go on \nthe calendar, and nothing else! I know this is here sy to traditional \ntime-management training, which has almost uni- \nversally taught that the \"daily to-do list\" is key.  But \nsuch lists don't work, for two reasons. \nFirst, constant new input and shifting tactical \npriorities reconfigure daily work so consistently t hat \nit's virtually impossible to nail down to-do items \nahead of time. Having a working game plan as a ref-\nerence point is always useful, but it must be able to be \nrenegotiated at any moment. Trying to keep a list i n writing on \nthe calendar, which must then be rewritten on anoth er day if \nitems don't get done, is demoralizing and a waste o f time. The \n\"Next Actions\" lists I advocate will hold all of th ose action \nreminders, even the most time-sensitive ones. And t hey won't \nhave to be rewritten daily. \nSecond, if there's something on a daily to-do list that doesn't",

That action needs to be the next physic al, visible behav- \nior, without exception, on every open loop. \nAny less-than-two-minute actions that you perform, and all \nother actions that have already been completed, do not, of course, \nneed to be tracked; they're done. What does need to be tracked is \nevery action that has to happen at a specific time or on a specific \nday (enter these in your calendar); those that need  to be done as \nsoon as they can (add these to your \"Next Actions\" lists); and all \nthose that you are waiting for others to do (put th ese on a \"Wait- \ning For\" list). \nCalendar \nReminders of actions you need to take fall into two  categories: \nthose about things that have to happen on a specifi c day or time, \nand those about things that just need to get done a s soon as possi- \nble. Your calendar handles the first type of remind er. \nThree things go on your calendar: \n• time-specific actions; \n• day-specific actions; and \n• day-specific information. \nTime-Specific Actions This is a fancy name for appointments. \nOften the next action to be taken on a project is a ttending a meet- \ning that has been set up to discuss it. Simply trac king that on the \ncalendar is sufficient. \nDay-Specific Actions These are things that you need to do some",

    "text": " to be taken on a project is a ttending a meet- \ning that has been set up to discuss it. Simply trac king that on the \ncalendar is sufficient. \nDay-Specific Actions These are things that you need to do some- \ntime on a certain day, but not necessarily at a specific time. Perhaps \nyou told Mioko you would call her on Friday to chec k that the \n39 \nTHE ART OF GETTING THINGS DONE  I  PART ONE \nreport you're sending her is OK. She won't have the  report until \nThursday, and she's leaving the country on Saturday , so Friday is \nthe time window for taking the action—but anytime F riday will \nbe fine. That should be tracked on the calendar for  Friday but not \ntied to any particular time slot—it should just go on the day. \nIt's \nuseful to have a calendar on which you can note bot h time- \nspecific and day-specific actions. \nDay-Specific Information The calendar is also the place to keep \ntrack of things you want to know about on specific days—not nec- \nessarily actions you'll have to take but rather information that may \nbe useful on a certain date. This might include dir ections for \nappointments, activities that other people (family or staff) will be \ninvolved in then, or events of interest. It's also helpful to put \nshort-term \"tickler\" information here, too, such as  a reminder to \ncall someone after the day they return from a vacat ion. \nNo More \"Daily To-Do\" Lists   Those three things are what go on \nthe calendar, and nothing else! I know this is here sy to traditional \ntime-management training, which has almost uni- \nversally taught that the \"daily to-do list\" is key.  But \nsuch lists don't work, for two reasons. \nFirst, constant new input and shifting tactical \npriorities reconfigure daily work so consistently t hat \nit's virtually impossible to nail down to-do items \nahead of time. Having a working game plan as a ref-\nerence point is always useful, but it must be able to be \nrenegotiated at any moment. Trying to keep a list i n writing on \nthe calendar, which must then be rewritten on anoth er day if \nitems don't get done, is demoralizing and a waste o f time. The \n\"Next Actions\"",

    "text": "-Specific Information The calendar is also the place to keep \ntrack of things you want to know about on specific days—not nec- \nessarily actions you'll have to take but rather information that may \nbe useful on a certain date. This might include dir ections for \nappointments, activities that other people (family or staff) will be \ninvolved in then, or events of interest. It's also helpful to put \nshort-term \"tickler\" information here, too, such as  a reminder to \ncall someone after the day they return from a vacat ion. \nNo More \"Daily To-Do\" Lists   Those three things are what go on \nthe calendar, and nothing else! I know this is here sy to traditional \ntime-management training, which has almost uni- \nversally taught that the \"daily to-do list\" is key.  But \nsuch lists don't work, for two reasons. \nFirst, constant new input and shifting tactical \npriorities reconfigure daily work so consistently t hat \nit's virtually impossible to nail down to-do items \nahead of time.

And t hey won't \nhave to be rewritten daily. \nSecond, if there's something on a daily to-do list that doesn't \nabsolutely have to get done that day, it will dilute the emphasis o n \n40 Blessed are the \nflexible, for they \nshall not be bent \nout of shape. \n—\nMichael \nCHAPTER 2  |  GETTING CONTROL OF YOUR LIFE: THE FIVE STAGES OF  MASTERING WORKFLOW \nthe things that truly do. If I have to call Mioko on Friday because \nthat's the only day I can reach her, but then I add  five other, less \nimportant or less time-sensitive calls to my to-do list, when the \nday gets crazy I may never call Mioko. My brain wil l have to take \nback the reminder that that's the one phone call I won't get \nanother chance at. That's not utilizing the system appropriately. \nThe way I look at it, the calendar should be sacred  territory. If you \nwrite something there, it must get done that day or  not at all. The \nonly rewriting should be for changed appointments. \nThe \"Next Actions\" List(s) \nSo where do all your action reminders go? On \"Next Actions\" \nlists, which, along with the calendar, are at the h eart of daily \naction-management organization. \nAny longer-than-two-minute, nondelegatable action y ou \nhave identified needs to be tracked somewhere. \"Cal l Jim Smith \nre budget meeting,\" \"Phone Rachel and Laura's moms about \nsleepaway camp,\" and \"Draft ideas re the annual sal es conference\" \nare all the kinds of action reminders that need to be kept in appro- \npriate lists, or buckets, to be assessed as options  for what we will \ndo at any point in time. \nIf you have only twenty or thirty of these, it may be fine to \nkeep them all on one list labeled \"Next Actions,\" w hich you'll \nreview whenever you have any free time. For most of\nus, however, the number is more likely to be fifty to \n150. In that case it makes sense to subdivide your \n\"Next Actions\" list into categories, such as \"Calls \" to \nmake when you're at a phone or \"Project Head Ques- \ntions\" to be asked at your weekly briefing. \nNonactionable Items \nYou need well-organized, discrete systems to handle  the items \nthat require no action as well as the ones that do.  No-action sys- \ntems fall into three categories: trash, incubation, and reference. \n41 Everything should \nbe made as simple \nas possible, but not \nsimpler. \n—Albert Einstein \n42 THE ART OF GETTING THINGS DONE  I  PART ONE \nTrash \nTrash should be self-evident. Throw away anything that ha s no \npotential future action or reference value. If you leave this stuff \nmixed in with other categories, it will seriously u ndermine the \nsystem. \nIncubation \nThere are two other groups of things besides trash that require no \nimmediate action, but this stuff you will want to keep. Here again, \nit's critical that you separate nonactionable from actionable items; \notherwise you will tend to go numb to your piles, s tacks, and lists \nand not know where to start or what needs to be don e. \nSay you pick up something from a memo, or read an e -mail, \nthat gives you an idea for a project you might want to do someday, \nbut not now. You'll want to be reminded of it again  later so you \ncan reassess the option of doing something about it  in the future. \nFor example, a brochure arrives in the mail for the  upcoming sea- \nson of your local symphony. On a quick browse, you see that the \nprogram that really interests you is still four mon ths away—too \ndistant for you to move on it yet (you're not sure what your travel \nschedule will be that far out), but if you are in town, you'd like to \ngo. What should you do about that? \nThere are two kinds of \"incubate\" systems that coul d work \nfor this kind of thing: \"Someday/Maybe\" lists and a  \"tickler\" file. \n\"Someday/Maybe\" It can be useful and inspiring to maintain an \nongoing list of things you might want to do at some  point but not \nnow. This is the \"parking lot\" for projects that wo uld be impossi- \nble to move on at present but that you don't want t o forget about \nentirely. You'd",

If I have to call Mioko on Friday because \nthat's the only day I can reach her, but then I add  five other, less \nimportant or less time-sensitive calls to my to-do list, when the \nday gets crazy I may never call Mioko. My brain wil l have to take \nback the reminder that that's the one phone call I won't get \nanother chance at. That's not utilizing the system appropriately. \nThe way I look at it, the calendar should be sacred  territory. If you \nwrite something there, it must get done that day or  not at all. The \nonly rewriting should be for changed appointments. \nThe \"Next Actions\" List(s) \nSo where do all your action reminders go? On \"Next Actions\" \nlists, which, along with the calendar, are at the h eart of daily \naction-management organization. \nAny longer-than-two-minute, nondelegatable action y ou \nhave identified needs to be tracked somewhere. \"Cal l Jim Smith \nre budget meeting,\" \"Phone Rachel and Laura's moms about \nsleepaway camp,\" and \"Draft ideas re the annual sal es conference\" \nare all the kinds of action reminders that need to be kept in appro- \npriate lists, or buckets, to be assessed as options  for what we will \ndo at any point in time. \nIf you have only twenty or thirty of these, it may be fine to \nkeep them all on one list labeled \"Next Actions,\" w hich you'll \nreview whenever you have any free time. For most of\nus, however, the number is more likely to be fifty to \n150. In that case it makes sense to subdivide your \n\"Next Actions\" list into categories, such as \"Calls \" to \nmake when you're at a phone or \"Project Head Ques- \ntions",

In that case it makes sense to subdivide your \n\"Next Actions\" list into categories, such as \"Calls \" to \nmake when you're at a phone or \"Project Head Ques- \ntions\" to be asked at your weekly briefing. \nNonactionable Items \nYou need well-organized, discrete systems to handle  the items \nthat require no action as well as the ones that do.  No-action sys- \ntems fall into three categories: trash, incubation, and reference. \n41 Everything should \nbe made as simple \nas possible, but not \nsimpler. \n—Albert Einstein \n42 THE ART OF GETTING THINGS DONE  I  PART ONE \nTrash \nTrash should be self-evident. Throw away anything that ha s no \npotential future action or reference value. If you leave this stuff \nmixed in with other categories, it will seriously u ndermine the \nsystem. \nIncubation \nThere are two other groups of things besides trash that require no \nimmediate action, but this stuff you will want to keep. Here again, \nit's critical that you separate nonactionable from actionable items; \notherwise you will tend to go numb to your piles, s tacks, and lists \nand not know where to start or what needs to be don e. \nSay you pick up something from a memo, or read an e -mail, \nthat gives you an idea for a project you might want to do someday, \nbut not now. You'll want to be reminded of it again  later so you \ncan reassess the option of doing something about it  in the future. \nFor example, a brochure arrives in the mail for the  upcoming sea- \nson of your local symphony. On a quick browse, you see that the \nprogram that really interests you is still four mon ths away—too \ndistant for you to move on it yet (you're not sure what your travel \nschedule will be that far out), but if you are in town, you'd like to \ngo. What should you do about that? \nThere are two kinds of \"incubate\" systems that coul d work \nfor this kind of thing: \"Someday/Maybe\" lists and a  \"tickler\" file. \n\"Someday/Maybe\" It can be useful and inspiring to maintain an \nongoing list of things you might want to do at some",

Here again, \nit's critical that you separate nonactionable from actionable items; \notherwise you will tend to go numb to your piles, s tacks, and lists \nand not know where to start or what needs to be don e. \nSay you pick up something from a memo, or read an e -mail, \nthat gives you an idea for a project you might want to do someday, \nbut not now. You'll want to be reminded of it again  later so you \ncan reassess the option of doing something about it  in the future. \nFor example, a brochure arrives in the mail for the  upcoming sea- \nson of your local symphony. On a quick browse, you see that the \nprogram that really interests you is still four mon ths away—too \ndistant for you to move on it yet (you're not sure what your travel \nschedule will be that far out), but if you are in town, you'd like to \ngo. What should you do about that? \nThere are two kinds of \"incubate\" systems that coul d work \nfor this",

I suggest you include a sca n of the con- \ntents in your Weekly Review (see page 46). \n\"Tickler\" File The most elegant version of holding for review is \nthe \"tickler\" file, sometimes also referred to as a  \"suspended\" or \n\"follow-on\" file. This is a system that allows you to almost literally \nmail something to yourself, for receipt on some des ignated day in \nthe future. \nYour calendar can serve the same function. You migh t \nremind yourself on your calendar for March 15, for example, that \n43 \n44 THE ART OF GETTING THINGS DONE  |  PART ONE \nyour taxes are due in a month; or for September 12,  that Swan \nLake will be presented by the Bolshoi at the Civic Audit orium in \nsix weeks. \nFor further details, refer to chapter 7. \nReference Material \nMany things that come your way require no action bu t have \nintrinsic value as information. You will want to ke ep and be able \nto retrieve these as needed. They can be stored in paper-based or \ndigital form. \nPaper-based material—anything from the menu for a l ocal \ntake-out deli to the plans, drawings, and vendor in formation for a \nlandscape project—is best stored in efficient physi cal-retrieval \nsystems. These can range from pages in a loose-leaf  planner or \nnotebook, for a list of favorite restaurants or the  phone numbers \nof the members of a school committee, to whole file  cabinets \ndedicated to the due-diligence paperwork for a corp orate merger. \nElectronic storage can include everything from netw orked \ndatabase information to ad hoc reference and archiv e folders \nlocated in your communication software. \nThe most important thing to remember here is that r efer- \nence should be exactly that—information that can be  easily \nreferred to when required. Reference systems genera lly take \ntwo forms: (1) topic- and area-specific storage, an d (2) general- \nreference files. The first types usually define the mselves in terms \nof how they are stored—for example, a file drawer d edicated to \ncontracts, by date; a drawer containing only confid ential \nemployee-compensation information; or a series of c abinets for \nclosed legal cases that might need to be consulted during future \ntrials. \nGeneral-Reference Filing The second type of reference system is \none that everyone needs close at hand for storing a d hoc informa- \ntion that doesn't belong in some predesignated cate gory.

If your reference \nmaterial doesn't have a nice clean edge to it, the line between \nactionable and nonactionable items will blur, visua lly and psycho- \nlogically, and your mind will go numb to the whole business. \nEstablishing a good working system for this categor y of material \nis critical to ensuring stress-free productivity; w e will explore it in \ndetail in chapter 7. \nReview \nIt's one thing to write down that you need milk; it 's another to be \nat the store and remember it. Likewise, writing down that you \nneed to call a friend for the name of an estate att orney is different \nfrom remembering it when you're at a phone and have  some dis- \ncretionary time. \nYou need to be able to review the whole picture of your life \nand work at appropriate intervals and appropriate l evels. For most \npeople the magic of workflow management is realized  in the con- \nsistent use of the review phase. This is where you take a look at \nall your outstanding projects and open loops, at wh at I call the \n10,000-foot level (see page 51), on a weekly basis.  It's your chance \nto scan all the defined actions and options before you, thus radi- \ncally increasing the efficacy of the choices you ma ke about what \nyou're doing at any point in time. \nWhat to Review When \nIf you set up a personal organization system struct ured as I rec- \nommend, with a \"Projects\" list, a calendar, \"Next A ctions\" lists, \n45 \nTHE ART OF GETTING THINGS DONE  |  PART ONE \nand a \"Waiting For\" list, not much will be required  to maintain \nthat system. \nThe item you'll probably review most frequently is your \ncalendar, which will remind you about the \"hard lan dscape\" for \nthe day—that is, what things will die if you don't do them. This \ndoesn't mean that the things written on there are t he most \n\"important\" in some grand sense—only that they have  to get \ndone. At at any point in time, knowing what has to get done, and \nwhen, creates a terrain for maneuvering. It's a goo d habit, as soon \nas you conclude an action on your calendar (a meeti ng, a phone \ncall, the final draft of a report), to check and se e what else remains \nto be done. \nAfter checking your calendar, you'll most often \nturn to your \"Next Actions\" lists. These hold the \ninventory of predefined actions that you can take i f \nyou have any discretionary time during the day. If \nyou've organized them by context (\"At Home,\" \"At \nComputer,\" \"In Meeting with George\"), they'll come \ninto play only when those contexts are available. \n\"Projects,\" \"Waiting For,\" and \"Someday/Maybe\" list s need \nto be reviewed only as often as you think they have  to be in order \nto stop you from wondering about them. \nCritical Success Factor: The Weekly Review \nEverything that might potentially require action mu st be \nreviewed on a frequent enough basis to keep your mi nd from tak- \ning back the job of remembering and reminding. In o rder to trust \nthe rapid and intuitive judgment calls that you mak e about \nactions from moment to moment, you must consistentl y retrench \nat some more elevated level. In my experience (with  thousands of \npeople), that translates into a behavior critical f or success: the \nWeekly Review. \nAll of your open loops (i.e., projects), active pro ject plans, \nand \"Next Actions,\" \"Agendas,\" \"Waiting For,\" and e ven \"Someday/ \nMaybe\" lists should be reviewed once a week. This a lso gives you \n46 Review your lists as \noften as you need \nto, to get them off \nyour mind. \nCHAPTER 2  |  GETTING CONTROL OF YOUR LIFE: THE FIVE STAGES OF  MASTERING WORKFLOW \nan opportunity to ensure that your brain is clear a nd \nthat all the loose strands of the past few days hav e \nbeen collected, processed, and organized. \nIf you're like most people, you've found that \nthings can get relatively out of control during the\ncourse of a few days of operational intensity. That 's \nto be expected. You wouldn't want to distract yours elf \nfrom too much of the work at hand in an effort to \nstay totally \"squeaky clean\" all the time. But in o rder \nto afford the luxury of \"getting on a roll\"",

This \ndoesn't mean that the things written on there are t he most \n\"important\" in some grand sense—only that they have  to get \ndone.

    "text": " wouldn't want to distract yours elf \nfrom too much of the work at hand in an effort to \nstay totally \"squeaky clean\" all the time. But in o rder \nto afford the luxury of \"getting on a roll\" with co nfi- \ndence, you'll probably need to clean house once \na week. \nThe Weekly Review is the time to \n• Gather and process all your \"stuff.\" \n• Review your system. \n• Update your lists. \n• Get clean, clear, current, and complete. The affairs of life \nembrace a \nmultitude of \ninterests, and he \nwho reasons in any \none of them, \nwithout consulting \nthe rest, is a \nvisionary unsuited \nto control the \nbusiness of the \nworld. \n—-James \nFenim \nore \nCooper \nMost people don't have a really complete system, an d they get \nno real payoff from reviewing things for just that reason: their \noverview isn't total. They still have a vague sense  that something \nmay be missing. That's why the rewards to be gained  from imple- \nmenting this whole process are at least geometric: the \nmore complete the system is, the more you'll trust it. \nAnd the more you trust it, the more complete you'll\nbe motivated to keep it. The Weekly Review is a mas- \nter key to maintaining that standard. \nMost people feel best about their work the week \nbefore their vacation, but it's not because of the vaca- \ntion itself. What do you do the last week before yo u \nleave on a big trip? You clean up, close up, clarif y, and \nrenegotiate all your agreements with yourself and \nothers. I just suggest that you do this weekly inst ead \nof yearly. \n47 Most people feel\nbest about their \nwork when they've \ncleaned up, closed \nup, clarified, and \nrenegotiated all\ntheir agreements \nwith themselves \nand others. Do this \nweekly instead of\nyearly.\nTHE ART OF GETTING THINGS DONE  I  PART ONE \nDo \nThe basic purpose of this workflow-management proce ss is to \nfacilitate good choices about what you're doing at any \npoint in time. At 10:33 A.M. Monday, deciding \nwhether to call Sandy, finish the proposal, or proc ess \nyour e-mails will always be an intuitive call, but with \nthe proper preplanning you can feel much more con- \nfident about your choices. You can move from hope to \ntrust in your actions, immediately increasing your \nspeed and effectiveness. \nThree Models for Making Action Choices \nLet's assume for a moment that you're not resisting  any of your \n\"stuff\" out of insecurity or procrastination. There  will always be a \nlarge list of actions that you are not doing at any given moment. \nSo how will you decide what to do and what not to do, and feel \ngood about both? \nThe answer is, by trusting your intuition. If you h ave col- \nlected, processed, organized, and reviewed all your current commit- \nments, you can galvanize your intuitive judgment wi th some \nintelligent and practical thinking about \nyour work \nand values. \nI have developed three models that will be help- \nful for you to incorporate in your decision-making \nabout what to do. They won't tell you answers—\nwhether you  call  Frederick,  e-mail your  son  at\nschool, or just go have an informal \"how are you?\" \nconversation with your secretary—but they will assi st \nyou in framing your options more intelligently. And  that's some- \nthing that the simple time- and priority-management  panaceas \ncan't do. Every decision to \nact is an intuitive \none. The challenge \nis to migrate from \nhoping it's the right \nchoice to trusting \nit's the right choice. \nYou have more to \ndo than you can \npossibly do. You \njust need to feel\ngood about your \nchoices. \nCHAPTER 2  I  GETTING CONTROL OF YOUR LIFE: THE FIVE STAGES OF  MASTERING WORKFLOW \n1. The Four-Criteria Model for Choosing Actions in the Moment \nAt 3:22 on Wednesday, how do you choose what to do?  There are \nfour criteria you can apply, in this order: \n1 | Context \n2 | Time available \n3 | Energy available \n4 | Priority \nContext A few actions can be done anywhere (like drafting i deas \nabout a project with pen and paper), but most requi re a specific \nlocation (at home, at your office) or having some p roductivity tool \nat hand, such as a phone or a computer. These are t he first",

The Weekly Review is a mas- \nter key to maintaining that standard. \nMost people feel best about their work the week \nbefore their vacation, but it's not because of the vaca- \ntion itself. What do you do the last week before yo u \nleave on a big trip? You clean up, close up, clarif y, and \nrenegotiate all your agreements with yourself and \nothers.

The Weekly Review is a mas- \nter key to maintaining that standard. \nMost people feel best about their work the week \nbefore their vacation, but it's not because of the vaca- \ntion itself. What do you do the last week before yo u \nleave on a big trip? You clean up, close up, clarif y, and \nrenegotiate all your agreements with yourself and \nothers.

Monday, deciding \nwhether to call Sandy, finish the proposal, or proc ess \nyour e-mails will always be an intuitive call, but with \nthe proper preplanning you can feel much more con- \nfident about your choices. You can move from hope to \ntrust in your actions, immediately increasing your \nspeed and effectiveness. \nThree Models for Making Action Choices \nLet's assume for a moment that you're not resisting  any of your \n\"stuff\" out of insecurity or procrastination. There  will always be a \nlarge list of actions that you are not doing at any given moment. \nSo how will you decide what to do and what not to do, and feel \ngood about both? \nThe answer is, by trusting your intuition. If you h ave col- \nlected, processed, organized, and reviewed all your current commit- \nments, you can galvanize your intuitive judgment wi th some \nintelligent and practical thinking about \nyour work \nand values. \nI have developed three models that will be help- \nful for you to incorporate in your decision-making \nabout what to do. They won't tell you answers—\nwhether you  call  Frederick,  e-mail your  son  at\nschool, or just go have an informal \"how are you?\" \nconversation with your secretary—but they will assi st \nyou in framing your options more intelligently. And  that's some- \nthing that the simple time- and priority-management  panaceas \ncan't do. Every decision to \nact is an intuitive \none. The challenge \nis to migrate from \nhoping it's the right \nchoice to trusting \nit's the right choice. \nYou have more to \ndo than you can \npossibly do. You \njust need to feel\ngood about your \nchoices. \nCHAPTER 2  I  GETTING CONTROL OF YOUR LIFE: THE FIVE STAGES OF  MASTERING WORKFLOW \n1. The Four-Criteria Model for Choosing Actions in the Moment \nAt 3:22 on Wednesday, how do you choose what to do?  There are \nfour criteria you can apply, in this order: \n1 | Context \n2 | Time available \n3 | Energy available \n4 | Priority \nContext A few actions can be done anywhere (like drafting i deas \n",

You can move from hope to \ntrust in your actions, immediately increasing your \nspeed and effectiveness. \nThree Models for Making Action Choices \nLet's assume for a moment that you're not resisting  any of your \n\"stuff\" out of insecurity or procrastination. There  will always be a \nlarge list of actions that you are not doing at any given moment. \nSo how will you decide what to do and what not to do, and feel \ngood about both? \nThe answer is, by trusting your intuition. If you h ave col- \nlected, processed, organized, and reviewed all your current commit- \nments, you can galvanize your intuitive judgment wi th some \nintelligent and practical thinking about \nyour work \nand values. \nI have developed three models that will be help- \nful for you to incorporate in your decision-making",

These are t he first factors \nthat limit your choices about what you can do in the moment. \nTime Available When do you have to do something else} Hav- \ning a meeting in five minutes would prevent doing m any actions \nthat require more time. \nEnergy Available How much energy do you have? Some actions \nyou have to do require a reservoir of fresh, creati ve mental energy. \nOthers need more physical horsepower. Some need ver y little of \neither. \nPriority Given your context, time, and energy available, wha t \naction will give you the highest payoff? You have a n hour, you're \nin your office with a phone and a computer, and you r energy is 7.3 \non a scale of 10. Should you call the client back, work on the pro- \nposal, process your voice-mails and e-mails, or che ck in with your \nspouse to see how his or her day is going? \nThis is where you need to access your intution and begin to \nrely on your judgment call in the moment. To explor e that con- \ncept further, let's examine two more models for dec iding what's \n\"most important\" for you to be doing. \n49 \n50 THE ART OF GETTING THINGS DONE  I  PART ONE \n2. The Threefold Model for Evaluating Daily Work \nWhen you're getting things done, or \"working\" in th e universal \nsense, there are three different kinds of activitie s you can be \nengaged in: \n• Doing predefined work \n• Doing work as it shows up \n• Defining your work \nDoing Predefined Work When you're doing predefined work, \nyou're working off your \"Next Actions\" lists—comple ting tasks \nthat you have previously determined need to be done , managing \nyour workflow. You're making the calls you need to make, drafting \nideas you want to brainstorm, or preparing a list o f things to talk \nto your attorney about. \nDoing Work as It Shows Up Often things come up ad hoc—\nunsuspected, unforeseen—that you either have to or choose to \nrespond to as they occur. For example, your partner  walks into \nyour office and wants to have a conversation about the new prod- \nuct launch, so you talk to her instead of doing all  the other things \nyou could be doing. Every day brings surprises—unpl anned-for \nthings that just show up, and you'll need to expend  at least some \ntime and energy on many of them. When you follow th ese leads, \nyou're deciding by default that these things are mo re important \nthan anything else you have to do. \nDefining Your Work Defining your work entails clearing up your \nin-basket, your e-mail, your voice-mail, and your m eeting notes \nand breaking down new projects into actionable step s. As you \nprocess your inputs, you'll no doubt be taking care  of some less- \nthan-two-minute actions and tossing and filing nume rous things \n(another version of doing work as it shows up). A g ood portion of \nthis activity will consist of identifying things th at need to get \nCHAPTER 2  |  GETTING CONTROL OF YOUR LIFE: THE FIVE STAGES OF  MASTERING WORKFLOW \ndone sometime, but not right away. You'll be adding  to all of your \nlists as you go along. \nOnce you have defined all your work, you can trust that your \nlists of things to do are complete. And your contex t, time, and \nenergy available still allow you the option of more  than one thing \nto do. The final thing to consider is the nature of  your work, and \nits goals and standards. \n3. The Six-Level Model for Reviewing Your Own Work \nPriorities should drive your choices, but most mode ls for deter- \nmining them are not reliable tools for much of our real work \nactivity. In order to know what your priorities are , you have to \nknow what your work is. And there are at least six different per- \nspectives from which to define that. To use an aero space analogy, \nthe conversation has a lot to do with the altitude.\n• 50,000+ feet: Life \n• 40,000 feet: Three- to five-year vision \n• 30,000 feet: One- to two-year goals \n• 20,000 feet: Areas of responsibility \n• 10,000 feet: Current projects \n• Runway: Current actions \nLet's start from the bottom up: \nRunway: Current Actions This is the accumulated list",

These are t he first factors \nthat limit your choices about what you can do in the moment. \nTime Available When do you have to do something else} Hav- \ning a meeting in five minutes would prevent doing m any actions \nthat require more time. \nEnergy Available How much energy do you have? Some actions \nyou have to do require a reservoir of fresh, creati ve mental energy. \nOthers need more physical horsepower. Some need ver y little of \neither. \nPriority Given your context, time, and energy available, wha t \naction will give you the highest payoff?

The Threefold Model for Evaluating Daily Work \nWhen you're getting things done, or \"working\" in th e universal \nsense, there are three different kinds of activitie s you can be \nengaged in: \n• Doing predefined work \n• Doing work as it shows up \n• Defining your work \nDoing Predefined Work When you're doing predefined work, \nyou're working off your \"Next Actions\" lists—comple ting tasks \nthat you have previously determined need to be done , managing \nyour workflow. You're making the calls you need to make, drafting \nideas you want to brainstorm, or preparing a list o f things to talk \nto your attorney about. \nDoing Work as It Shows Up Often things come up ad hoc—\nunsuspected, unforeseen—that you either have to or choose to \nrespond to as they occur.

For example, your partner  walks into \nyour office and wants to have a conversation about the new prod- \nuct launch, so you talk to her instead of doing all  the other things \nyou could be doing. Every day brings surprises—unpl anned-for \nthings that just show up, and you'll need to expend  at least some \ntime and energy on many of them. When you follow th ese leads, \nyou're deciding by default that these things are mo re important \nthan anything else you have to do. \nDefining Your Work Defining your work entails clearing up your \nin-basket, your e-mail, your voice-mail, and your m eeting notes \nand breaking down new projects into actionable step s. As you \nprocess your inputs, you'll no doubt be taking care  of some less- \nthan-two-minute actions and tossing and filing nume rous things \n(another version of doing work as it shows up). A g ood portion of \nthis activity will consist of identifying things th at need to get \nCHAPTER 2  |  GETTING CONTROL OF YOUR LIFE: THE FIVE STAGES OF  MASTERING WORKFLOW \ndone sometime, but not right away. You'll be adding  to all of your \nlists as you go along. \nOnce you have defined all your work, you can trust that your \nlists of things to do are complete. And your contex t, time, and \nenergy available still allow you the option of more  than one thing \nto do. The final thing to consider is the nature of  your work, and \nits goals and standards. \n3. The Six-Level Model for Reviewing Your Own Work \nPriorities should drive your choices, but most mode ls for deter- \nmining them are not reliable tools for much of our real work \nactivity. In order to know what your priorities are , you have to \nknow what your work is. And there are at least six different per- \nspectives from which to define that. To use an aero space analogy, \nthe conversation has a lot to do with the altitude.\n• 50,000+ feet: Life \n• 40,000 feet: Three- to five-year vision \n• 30,000 feet: One- to two",

You'd probably have three hundred to five h undred hours'\nworth of these things to do if you stopped the worl d right now \nand got no more input from yourself or anyone else.\n10,000 Feet: Current Projects Creating many of the actions that \nyou currently have in front of you are the thirty t o one hundred \n51 \n52 THE ART OF GETTING THINGS DONE  I  PART ONE \nprojects on your plate. These are the relatively sh ort-term out- \ncomes you want to achieve, such as setting up a hom e computer, \norganizing a sales conference, moving to a new head quarters, and \ngetting a dentist. \n20,000 Feet: Areas of Responsibility You create or accept most of \nyour projects because of your responsibilities, whi ch for most \npeople can be defined in ten to fifteen categories.  These are the \nkey areas within which you want to achieve results and maintain \nstandards. Your job may entail at least implicit co mmitments \nfor things like strategic planning, administrative support, staff \ndevelopment, market research, customer service, or asset manage- \nment. And your personal life has an equal number of  such focus \narenas: health, family, finances, home environment,  spirituality, \nrecreation, etc. Listing and reviewing these respon sibilities gives a \nmore comprehensive framework for evaluating your in ventory of \nprojects. \n30,000 Feet: One- to Two-Year Goals What you want to be expe- \nriencing in the various areas of your life and work  one to two years \nfrom now will add another dimension to defining you r work. \nOften meeting the goals and objectives of your job will require a \nshift in emphasis of your job focus, with new areas  of responsi- \nbility emerging. At this horizon personally, too, t here probably are \nthings you'd like to accomplish or have in place, w hich could add \nimportance to certain aspects of your life and dimi nish others. \n40,000 Feet: Three- to Five-Year Vision Projecting three to five \nyears into the future generates thinking about bigg er categories: \norganization strategies, environmental trends, care er and life- \ntransition circumstances. Internal factors include longer-term \ncareer, family, and financial goals and considerati ons. Outer- \nworld issues could involve changes affecting your j ob and organi- \nzation, such as technology, globalization, market t rends, and \nCHAPTER 2  |  GETTING CONTROL OF YOUR LIFE: THE FIVE STAGES OF  MASTERING WORKFLOW \ncompetition. Decisions at this altitude could easil y change what \nyour work might look like on many levels. \n50, 000+ Feet Life This is the \"big picture\" view. Why does your \ncompany exist? Why do you exist? The primary purpose for any- \nthing provides the core definition of what its \"wor k\" really is. It is \nthe ultimate job description. All the goals, vision s, objectives, \nprojects, and actions derive from this, and lead to ward it. \nThese altitude analogies are somewhat arbitrary, an d in real \nlife the important conversations you will have abou t your focus \nand your priorities may not fit exactly to one hori zon or another. \nThey can provide a useful framework, however, to re mind you of \nthe multilayered nature of your \"job\" and resulting  commitments \nand tasks. \nObviously, many factors must be considered before y ou feel \ncomfortable that you have made the best decision ab out what to \ndo and when. \"Setting priorities\" in the traditiona l sense of focus- \ning on your long-term goals and values, though obvi ously a neces- \nsary core focus, does not provide a practical frame work for a vast \nmajority of the decisions and tasks you must engage  in day to day. \nMastering the flow of your work at all the levels y ou experience \nthat work provides a much more holistic way to get things done, \nand feel good about it. \nPart 2 of this book will provide specific coaching about how \nto use these three models for making action choices , and how the \nbest practices for collecting, processing, planning , organizing, and \nreviewing all contribute to your greatest success w ith them. \n53",
