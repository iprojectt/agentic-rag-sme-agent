    "text": "Rule #3\nQuit Social Media\nIn 2013, author and digital media \nconsultant Baratunde Thurston launched \nan experiment. He decided to disconnect \nfrom his online life for twenty-five days: \nno Facebook, no Twitter, no Foursquare \n(a service that awarded him “Mayor of \nthe Year” in 2011), not even e-mail. He \nneeded the break. Thurston, who is\n\ndescribed by friends as “the most \nconnected man in the world,” had by his \nown count participated in more than \nfifty-nine thousand Gmail conversations \nand posted fifteen hundred times on his \nFacebook wall in the year leading up to \nhis experiment. “I was burnt out. Fried. \nDone. Toast,” he explained.\nWe know about Thurston’s \nexperiment because he wrote about it in \na cover article for Fast Company  \nmagazine, ironically titled “#UnPlug.” \nAs Thurston reveals in the article, it \ndidn’t take long to adjust to a \ndisconnected life. “By the end of that \nfirst week, the quiet rhythm of my days \nseemed far less strange,” he said. “I was\n\nless stressed about not knowing new \nthings; I felt that I still existed despite \nnot having shared documentary evidence \nof said existence on the Internet.” \nThurston struck up conversations with \nstrangers. He enjoyed food without \nInstagramming the experience. He bought \na bike (“turns out it’s easier to ride the \nthing when you’re not trying to \nsimultaneously check your Twitter”). \n“The end came too soon,” Thurston \nlamented. But he had start-ups to run and \nbooks to market, so after the twenty-five \ndays passed, he reluctantly reactivated \nhis online presence.\nBaratunde Thurston’s experiment \nneatly summarizes two important points\n\nabout our culture’s current relationship \nwith social networks like Facebook, \nTwitter, and Instagram, and infotainment \nsites like Business Insider and BuzzFeed \n—two categories of online distraction \nthat I will collectively call “network \ntools” in the pages ahead. The first point \nis that we increasingly recognize that \nthese tools fragment our time and reduce \nour ability to concentrate. This reality no \nlonger generates much debate; we all \nfeel it. This is a real problem for many \ndifferent people, but the problem is \nespecially dire if you’re attempting to \nimprove your ability to work deeply. In \nthe preceding rule, for example, I \ndescribed several strategies to help you\n\nsharpen your focus. These efforts will \nbecome significantly more difficult if \nyou simultaneously behave like a pre­\nexperiment Baratunde Thurston, \nallowing your life outside such training \nto remain a distracted blur of apps and \nbrowser tabs. Willpower is limited, and \ntherefore the more enticing tools you \nhave pulling at your attention, the harder \nit’ll be to maintain focus on something \nimportant. To master the art of deep \nwork, therefore, you must take back \ncontrol of your time and attention from \nthe many diversions that attempt to steal \nthem\nBefore we begin fighting back \nagainst these distractions, however, we\n\nmust better understand the battlefield. \nThis brings me to the second important \npoint summarized by Baratunde \nThurston’s story: the impotence with \nwhich knowledge workers currently \ndiscuss this problem of network tools \nand attention. Overwhelmed by these \ntools’  demands on his time, Thurston felt \nthat his only option was to (temporarily) \nquit the Internet altogether. This idea that \na drastic Internet sabbatical - is the only \nalternative to the distraction generated \nby social media and infotainment has \nincreasingly pervaded our cultural \nconversation.\nThe problem with this binary \nresponse to this issue is that these two\n\nchoices are much too crude to be useful. \nThe notion that you would quit the \nInternet is, of course, an overstuffed \nstraw man, infeasible for most (unless \nyou’re a journalist writing a piece about \ndistraction). No one is meant to actually \nfollow Baratunde Thurston’s lead—and \nthis reality provides justification for \nremaining with the only offered \nalternative: accepting our current\ndistracted state as inevitable. For all the \ninsight and clarity that Thurston gained \nduring his Internet sabbatical, for \nexample, it didn’t take him long once the \nexperiment ended to slide back into the \nfragmented state where he began. On the \nday when I first starting writing this\n\nchapter, which fell only six months af ter \nThurston’s article originally appeared in \nFast Company , the reformed connector \nhad already sent a dozen Tweets in the \nfew hours since he woke up.\nThis rule attempts to break us out of \nthis rut by proposing a third option: \naccepting",

    "text": "Rule #3\nQuit Social Media\nIn 2013, author and digital media \nconsultant Baratunde Thurston launched \nan experiment. He decided to disconnect \nfrom his online life for twenty-five days: \nno Facebook, no Twitter, no Foursquare \n(a service that awarded him “Mayor of \nthe Year” in 2011), not even e-mail. He \nneeded the break. Thurston, who is\n\ndescribed by friends as “the most \nconnected man in the world,” had by his \nown count participated in more than \nfifty-nine thousand Gmail conversations \nand posted fifteen hundred times on his \nFacebook wall in the year leading up to \nhis experiment. “I was burnt out. Fried. \nDone. Toast,” he explained.\nWe know about Thurston’s \nexperiment because he wrote about it in \na cover article for Fast Company  \nmagazine, ironically titled “#UnPlug.” \nAs Thurston reveals in the article, it \ndidn’t take long to adjust to a \ndisconnected life. “By the end of that \nfirst week, the quiet rhythm of my days \nseemed far less strange,” he said. “I was\n\nless stressed about not knowing new \nthings; I felt that I still existed despite \nnot having shared documentary evidence \nof said existence on the Internet.” \nThurston struck up conversations with \nstrangers. He enjoyed food without \nInstagramming the experience. He bought \na bike (“turns out it’s easier to ride the \nthing when you’re not trying to \nsimultaneously check your Twitter”). \n“The end came too soon,” Thurston \nlamented. But he had start-ups to run and \nbooks to market, so after the twenty-five \ndays passed, he reluctantly reactivated \nhis online presence.\nBaratunde Thurston’s experiment \nneatly summarizes two important points\n\nabout our culture’s current relationship \nwith social networks like Facebook, \nTwitter, and Instagram, and infotainment \nsites like Business Insider and BuzzFeed \n—two categories of online distraction \nthat I will collectively call “network \ntools” in the pages ahead. The first point \nis that we increasingly recognize that \nthese tools fragment our time and reduce \nour ability to concentrate. This reality no \nlonger generates much debate; we all \nfeel it. This is a real problem for many \ndifferent people, but the problem is \nespecially dire if you’re attempting to \nimprove your ability to work",

This is a real problem for many \ndifferent people, but the problem is \nespecially dire if you’re attempting to \nimprove your ability to work deeply. In \nthe preceding rule, for example, I \ndescribed several strategies to help you\n\nsharpen your focus. These efforts will \nbecome significantly more difficult if \nyou simultaneously behave like a pre­\nexperiment Baratunde Thurston, \nallowing your life outside such training \nto remain a distracted blur of apps and \nbrowser tabs. Willpower is limited, and \ntherefore the more enticing tools you \nhave pulling at your attention, the harder \nit’ll be to maintain focus on something \nimportant. To master the art of deep \nwork, therefore, you must take back \ncontrol of your time and attention from \nthe many diversions that attempt to steal \nthem\nBefore we begin fighting back \nagainst these distractions, however, we\n\nmust better understand the battlefield. \nThis brings me to the second important \npoint summarized by Baratunde \nThurston’s story: the impotence with \nwhich knowledge workers currently \ndiscuss this problem of network tools \nand attention. Overwhelmed by these \ntools’  demands on his time, Thurston felt \nthat his only option was to (temporarily) \nquit the Internet altogether. This idea that \na drastic Internet sabbatical - is the only \nalternative to the distraction generated \nby social media and infotainment has \nincreasingly pervaded our cultural \nconversation.\nThe problem with this binary \nresponse to this issue is that these two\n\nchoices are much too crude to be useful. \nThe notion that you would quit the \nInternet is, of course, an overstuffed \nstraw man, infeasible for most (unless \nyou’re a journalist writing a piece about \ndistraction). No one is meant to actually \nfollow Baratunde Thurston’s lead—and \nthis reality provides justification for \nremaining with the only offered \nalternative: accepting our current\ndistracted state as inevitable. For all the \ninsight and clarity that Thurston gained \nduring his Internet sabbatical, for \nexample, it didn’t take him long once the \nexperiment ended to slide back into the \nfragmented state where he began. On the \nday when I first starting writing this\n\nchapter, which fell only six months af ter \nThurston",

    "text": "’s article originally appeared in \nFast Company , the reformed connector \nhad already sent a dozen Tweets in the \nfew hours since he woke up.\nThis rule attempts to break us out of \nthis rut by proposing a third option: \naccepting that these tools are not \ninherently evil, and that some of them \nmight be quite vital to your success and \nhappiness, but at the same time  also \naccepting that the threshold for allowing \na site regular access to your time and \nattention (not to mention personal data) \nshould be much more stringent, and that \nmost people should therefore be using \nmany fewer such tools. I won’t ask you,\n\nin other words, to quit the Internet \naltogether like Baratunde Thurston did \nfor twenty-five days back in 2013. But I \nwill ask you to reject the state of \ndistracted hyperconnectedness that \ndrove him to that drastic experiment in \nthe first place. There is a middle ground, \nand if you’re interested in developing a \ndeep work habit, you must fight to get \nthere.\nOur first step toward finding this middle \nground in network tool selection is to \nunderstand the current default decision \nprocess deployed by most Internet users. \nIn the fall of 2013, I received insight into \nthis process because of an article I\n\nwrote explaining why I never joined \nFacebook. Though the piece was meant \nto be explanatory and not accusatory, it \nnonetheless put many readers on the \ndefensive, leading them to reply with \njustifications for their  use of the service. \nHere are some examples of these \njustifications:\n• “Entertainment was my initial \ndraw to Facebook. I can see what \nmy friends are up to and post funny \nphotos, make quick comments.”\n• “[When] I first joined, [I didn’t \nknow why]... By mere curiosity I \njoined a forum of short fiction \nstories. [Once] there I improved\n\nmy writing and made very good \nfriends.”\n• “[I use] Facebook because a lot of \npeople I knew in high school are \non there.”\nHere’s what strikes me about these \nresponses (which are representative of \nthe large amount of feedback I received \non this topic): They’re surprisingly \nminor. I don’t doubt, for example, that \nthe first commenter from this list finds \nsome entertainment in using Facebook, \nbut I would also assume that this person \nwasn’t suffering some severe deficit of \nentertainment options before he or she \nsigned up for the service. I would further\n\nwager that this user would succeed in \nstaving off boredom even if the service \nwere suddenly shut down. Facebook, at \nbest, added one more (arguably quite \nmediocre) entertainment option to many \nthat already existed.\nAnother commenter cited making \nfriends in a writing forum. I don’t doubt \nthe existence of these friends, but we can \nassume that these friendships are \nlightweight—given that they’re based on \nsending short messages back and forth \nover a computer network. There’s \nnothing wrong with such lightweight \nfriendships, but they’re unlikely to be at \nthe center of this user’s social life. \nSomething similar can be said about the\n\ncommenter who reconnected with high \nschool friends: This is a nice diversion, \nbut hardly something central to his or her \nsense of social connection or happiness.\nTo be clear, I’m not trying to \ndenigrate the benefits identified \npreviously—there’s nothing illusory or \nmisguided about them. What I’m \nemphasizing, however, is that these \nbenefits are minor and somewhat \nrandom. (By contrast, if you’d instead \nasked someone to justify the use of, say, \nthe World Wide Web more generally, or \ne-mail, the arguments would become \nmuch more concrete and compelling.) To \nthis observation, you might reply that \nvalue is value:  If you can find some\n\nextra benefit in using a service like \nFacebook—even if it’s small—then why \nnot use it? I call this way of thinking the \nany-benefit  mind-set, as it identifies any \npossible benefit as sufficient \njustification for using a network tool. In \nmore detail:\nThe Any-Benefit Approach to  \nNetwork Tool Selection: You're justified \nin using a network tool if you can identify \nany possible benefit to its use, or anything \nyou might possibly miss out on if you don't \nuse it.\nThe problem with this approach, of \ncourse, is that it ignores all the negatives\n\nthat come along with the tools in \nquestion. These services are engineered \nto be addictive—robbing time and \nattention from activities that more \ndirectly support your professional and \npersonal goals (such as deep work). \nEventually, if you use these tools enough, \nyou’ll arrive at the",

    "text": "’s article originally appeared in \nFast Company , the reformed connector \nhad already sent a dozen Tweets in the \nfew hours since he woke up.\nThis rule attempts to break us out of \nthis rut by proposing a third option: \naccepting that these tools are not \ninherently evil, and that some of them \nmight be quite vital to your success and \nhappiness, but at the same time  also \naccepting that the threshold for allowing \na site regular access to your time and \nattention (not to mention personal data) \nshould be much more stringent, and that \nmost people should therefore be using \nmany fewer such tools. I won’t ask you,\n\nin other words, to quit the Internet \naltogether like Baratunde Thurston did \nfor twenty-five days back in 2013. But I \nwill ask you to reject the state of \ndistracted hyperconnectedness that \ndrove him to that drastic experiment in \nthe first place. There is a middle ground, \nand if you’re interested in developing a \ndeep work habit, you must fight to get \nthere.\nOur first step toward finding this middle \nground in network tool selection is to \nunderstand the current default decision \nprocess deployed by most Internet users. \nIn the fall of 2013, I received insight into \nthis process because of an article I\n\nwrote explaining why I never joined \nFacebook. Though the piece was meant \nto be explanatory and not accusatory, it \nnonetheless put many readers on the \ndefensive, leading them to reply with \njustifications for their  use of the service. \nHere are some examples of these \njustifications:\n• “Entertainment was my initial \ndraw to Facebook. I can see what \nmy friends are up to and post funny \nphotos, make quick comments.”\n• “[When] I first joined, [I didn’t \nknow why]... By mere curiosity I \njoined a forum of short fiction \nstories. [Once] there I improved\n\nmy writing and made very good \nfriends.”\n• “[I use] Facebook because a lot of \npeople I knew in high school are \non there.”\nHere’s what strikes me about these \nresponses (which are representative of \nthe large amount of feedback I received \non this topic): They’re surprisingly \nminor. I don’t doubt, for example, that \nthe first commenter from this list finds \nsome entertainment in using Facebook, \nbut I would also assume that this",

    "text": "the large amount of feedback I received \non this topic): They’re surprisingly \nminor. I don’t doubt, for example, that \nthe first commenter from this list finds \nsome entertainment in using Facebook, \nbut I would also assume that this person \nwasn’t suffering some severe deficit of \nentertainment options before he or she \nsigned up for the service. I would further\n\nwager that this user would succeed in \nstaving off boredom even if the service \nwere suddenly shut down. Facebook, at \nbest, added one more (arguably quite \nmediocre) entertainment option to many \nthat already existed.\nAnother commenter cited making \nfriends in a writing forum. I don’t doubt \nthe existence of these friends, but we can \nassume that these friendships are \nlightweight—given that they’re based on \nsending short messages back and forth \nover a computer network. There’s \nnothing wrong with such lightweight \nfriendships, but they’re unlikely to be at \nthe center of this user’s social life. \nSomething similar can be said about the\n\ncommenter who reconnected with high \nschool friends: This is a nice diversion, \nbut hardly something central to his or her \nsense of social connection or happiness.\nTo be clear, I’m not trying to \ndenigrate the benefits identified \npreviously—there’s nothing illusory or \nmisguided about them. What I’m \nemphasizing, however, is that these \nbenefits are minor and somewhat \nrandom. (By contrast, if you’d instead \nasked someone to justify the use of, say, \nthe World Wide Web more generally, or \ne-mail, the arguments would become \nmuch more concrete and compelling.) To \nthis observation, you might reply that \nvalue is value:  If you can find some\n\nextra benefit in using a service like \nFacebook—even if it’s small—then why \nnot use it? I call this way of thinking the \nany-benefit  mind-set, as it identifies any \npossible benefit as sufficient \njustification for using a network tool. In \nmore detail:\nThe Any-Benefit Approach to  \nNetwork Tool Selection: You're justified \nin using a network tool if you can identify \nany possible benefit to its use, or anything \nyou might possibly miss out on if you don't \nuse it.\nThe problem with this approach, of \ncourse, is that it ignores all the negatives\n\nthat come along with the tools in \nquestion.

What I’m \nemphasizing, however, is that these \nbenefits are minor and somewhat \nrandom. (By contrast, if you’d instead \nasked someone to justify the use of, say, \nthe World Wide Web more generally, or \ne-mail, the arguments would become \nmuch more concrete and compelling.) To \nthis observation, you might reply that \nvalue is value:  If you can find some\n\nextra benefit in using a service like \nFacebook—even if it’s small—then why \nnot use it? I call this way of thinking the \nany-benefit  mind-set, as it identifies any \npossible benefit as sufficient \njustification for using a network tool. In \nmore detail:\nThe Any-Benefit Approach to  \nNetwork Tool Selection: You're justified \nin using a network tool if you can identify \nany possible benefit",

    "text": " services are engineered \nto be addictive—robbing time and \nattention from activities that more \ndirectly support your professional and \npersonal goals (such as deep work). \nEventually, if you use these tools enough, \nyou’ll arrive at the state of burned-out, \nhyperdistracted connectivity that plagued \nBaratunde Thurston and millions of \nothers like him It’s here that we \nencounter the true insidious nature of an \nany-benefit mind-set. The use of network \ntools can be harmful. If you don’t attempt \nto weigh pros against cons, but instead \nuse any glimpse of some potential \nbenefit as justification for unrestrained\n\nuse of a tool, then you’re unwittingly \ncrippling your ability to succeed in the \nworld of knowledge work.\nThis conclusion, if considered \nobjectively, shouldn’t be surprising. In \nthe context of network tools, we’ve \nbecome comfortable with the any-benefit \nmind-set, but if we instead zoom out and \nconsider this mind-set in the broader \ncontext of skilled labor, it suddenly \nseems a bizarre and ahistorical approach \nto choosing tools. In other words, once \nyou put aside the revolutionary rhetoric \nsurrounding all things Internet—the \nsense, summarized in Part 1, that you’re \neither fully committed to “the \nrevolution” or a Luddite curmudgeon—\n\nyou’ll soon realize that network tools \nare not exceptional; they’re tools, no \ndifferent from a blacksmith’s hammer or \nan artist’s brush, used by skilled \nlaborers to do their jobs better (and \noccasionally to enhance their leisure). \nThroughout history, skilled laborers \nhave applied sophistication and \nskepticism to their encounters with new \ntools and their decisions about whether \nto adopt them. There’s no reason why \nknowledge workers cannot do the same \nwhen it comes to the Internet—the fact \nthat the skilled labor here now involves \ndigital bits doesn’t change this reality.\nTo help understand what this more \ncareful tool curation might look like, it\n\nmakes sense to start by talking to \nsomeone who makes a living working \nwith (nondigital) tools and relies on a \ncomplex relationship with these tools to \nsucceed. Fortunately for our purposes, I \nfound just such an individual in a lanky \nEnglish major turned successful \nsustainable farmer, named (almost too \naptly), Forrest Pritchard.\nForrest Pritchard runs Smith Meadows, \na family farm located an hour west of \nD.C.— one of many farms clustered in \nthe valleys of the Blue Ridge Mountains. \nSoon after taking control of the land \nfrom his parents, as I learned, Pritchard \nmoved the operation away from\n\ntraditional monoculture crops and \ntoward the then novel concept of grass- \nfinished meat. The farm bypasses \nwholesaling—you cannot find Smith \nMeadows steaks in Whole Foods—to \nsell direct to consumers at the bustling \nfarmers’  markets in the Washington, \nD.C., metro area. By all accounts, the \nfarm is thriving in an industry that rarely \nrewards small operations.\nI first encountered Pritchard at our \nlocal farmers’  market in Takoma Park, \nMaryland, where the Smith Meadows \nstand does good business. To see \nPritchard, usually standing a foot taller \nthan most of his suburbanite customers, \nwearing the obligatory faded flannel of\n\nthe farmer, is to see a craf tsman \nconfident in his trade. I introduced \nmyself to him because farming is a skill \ndependent on the careful management of \ntools, and I wanted to understand how a \ncraftsman in a nondigital field \napproaches this crucial task.\n“Haymaking is a good example,” he \ntold me, not long into one of our \nconversations on the topic. “It’s a \nsubject where I can give you the basic \nidea without having to gloss over the \nunderlying economics.”\nWhen Pritchard took over Smith \nMeadows, he explained, the farm made \nits own hay to use as animal feed during \nthe winter months when grazing is\n\nimpossible. Haymaking is done with a \npiece of equipment called a hay baler: a \ndevice you pull behind a tractor that \ncompresses and binds dried grass into \nbales. If you raise animals on the East \nCoast there’s an obvious reason to own \nand operate a hay baler: Your animals \nneed hay. Why spend money to “buy in” \nfeed when you have perfectly good grass \ngrowing for free right in your own soil? \nIf a farmer subscribed to the any-benefit \napproach used by knowledge workers, \ntherefore, he would definitely buy a hay \nbaler. But as Pritchard explained to me \n(after preemptively apologizing for a \nmoment",

    "text": " services are engineered \nto be addictive—robbing time and \nattention from activities that more \ndirectly support your professional and \npersonal goals (such as deep work). \nEventually, if you use these tools enough, \nyou’ll arrive at the state of burned-out, \nhyperdistracted connectivity that plagued \nBaratunde Thurston and millions of \nothers like him It’s here that we \nencounter the true insidious nature of an \nany-benefit mind-set. The use of network \ntools can be harmful. If you don’t attempt \nto weigh pros against cons, but instead \nuse any glimpse of some potential \nbenefit as justification for unrestrained\n\nuse of a tool, then you’re unwittingly \ncrippling your ability to succeed in the \nworld of knowledge work.\nThis conclusion, if considered \nobjectively, shouldn’t be surprising. In \nthe context of network tools, we’ve \nbecome comfortable with the any-benefit \nmind-set, but if we instead zoom out and \nconsider this mind-set in the broader \ncontext of skilled labor, it suddenly \nseems a bizarre and ahistorical approach \nto choosing tools. In other words, once \nyou put aside the revolutionary rhetoric \nsurrounding all things Internet—the \nsense, summarized in Part 1, that you’re \neither fully committed to “the \nrevolution” or a Luddite curmudgeon—\n\nyou’ll soon realize that network tools \nare not exceptional; they’re tools, no \ndifferent from a blacksmith’s hammer or \nan artist’s brush, used by skilled \nlaborers to do their jobs better (and \noccasionally to enhance their leisure). \nThroughout history, skilled laborers \nhave applied sophistication and \nskepticism to their encounters with new \ntools and their decisions about whether \nto adopt them. There’s no reason why \nknowledge workers cannot do the same \nwhen it comes to the Internet—the fact \nthat the skilled labor here now involves \ndigital bits doesn’t change this reality.\nTo help understand what this more \ncareful tool curation might look like, it\n\nmakes sense to start by talking to \nsomeone who makes a living working \nwith (nondigital) tools and relies on a \ncomplex relationship with these tools to \nsucceed. Fortunately for our purposes, I \nfound just such an individual in a lanky \nEnglish major turned successful \nsustainable farmer, named (almost too \naptly), Forrest Pritchard.\nForrest",

The use of network \ntools can be harmful. If you don’t attempt \nto weigh pros against cons, but instead \nuse any glimpse of some potential \nbenefit as justification for unrestrained\n\nuse of a tool, then you’re unwittingly \ncrippling your ability to succeed in the \nworld of knowledge work.\nThis conclusion, if considered \nobjectively, shouldn’t be surprising. In \nthe context of network tools, we’ve \nbecome comfortable with the any-benefit \nmind-set, but if we instead zoom out and \nconsider this mind-set in the broader \ncontext of skilled labor, it suddenly \nseems a bizarre and ahistorical approach \nto choosing tools. In other words, once \nyou put aside the revolutionary rhetoric \nsurrounding all things",

    "text": " relationship with these tools to \nsucceed. Fortunately for our purposes, I \nfound just such an individual in a lanky \nEnglish major turned successful \nsustainable farmer, named (almost too \naptly), Forrest Pritchard.\nForrest Pritchard runs Smith Meadows, \na family farm located an hour west of \nD.C.— one of many farms clustered in \nthe valleys of the Blue Ridge Mountains. \nSoon after taking control of the land \nfrom his parents, as I learned, Pritchard \nmoved the operation away from\n\ntraditional monoculture crops and \ntoward the then novel concept of grass- \nfinished meat. The farm bypasses \nwholesaling—you cannot find Smith \nMeadows steaks in Whole Foods—to \nsell direct to consumers at the bustling \nfarmers’  markets in the Washington, \nD.C., metro area. By all accounts, the \nfarm is thriving in an industry that rarely \nrewards small operations.\nI first encountered Pritchard at our \nlocal farmers’  market in Takoma Park, \nMaryland, where the Smith Meadows \nstand does good business. To see \nPritchard, usually standing a foot taller \nthan most of his suburbanite customers, \nwearing the obligatory faded flannel of\n\nthe farmer, is to see a craf tsman \nconfident in his trade. I introduced \nmyself to him because farming is a skill \ndependent on the careful management of \ntools, and I wanted to understand how a \ncraftsman in a nondigital field \napproaches this crucial task.\n“Haymaking is a good example,” he \ntold me, not long into one of our \nconversations on the topic. “It’s a \nsubject where I can give you the basic \nidea without having to gloss over the \nunderlying economics.”\nWhen Pritchard took over Smith \nMeadows, he explained, the farm made \nits own hay to use as animal feed during \nthe winter months when grazing is\n\nimpossible. Haymaking is done with a \npiece of equipment called a hay baler: a \ndevice you pull behind a tractor that \ncompresses and binds dried grass into \nbales. If you raise animals on the East \nCoast there’s an obvious reason to own \nand operate a hay baler: Your animals \nneed hay. Why spend money to “buy in” \nfeed when you have perfectly good grass \ngrowing for free right in your own soil?",

    "text": " \nIf a farmer subscribed to the any-benefit \napproach used by knowledge workers, \ntherefore, he would definitely buy a hay \nbaler. But as Pritchard explained to me \n(after preemptively apologizing for a \nmoment of snark), if a farmer actually \nadopted such a simplistic mind-set, “I’d\n\nbe counting the days until the ‘For Sale’  \nsign goes up on the property.” Pritchard, \nlike most practitioners of his trade, \ninstead deploys a more sophisticated \nthought process when assessing tools. \nAnd after applying this process to the \nhay baler, Pritchard was quick to sell it: \nSmith Meadows now purchases all the \nhay it uses.\nHere  S  why...\n“Let’s start by exploring the costs of \nmaking hay,” Pritchard said. “First, \nthere’s the actual cost of fuel, and \nrepairs, and the shed to keep the baler. \nYou also have to pay taxes on it.” These \ndirectly measurable costs, however, \nwere the easy part of his decision. It was\n\ninstead the “opportunity costs” that \nrequired more attention. As he \nelaborated: “If I make hay all summer, I \ncan’t be doing something else. For \nexample, I now use that time instead to \nraise boilers [chickens meant for eating]. \nThese generate positive cash flow, \nbecause I can sell them But they also \nproduce manure which I can then use to \nenhance my soil.” Then there’s the \nequally subtle issue of assessing the \nsecondary value of a purchased bale of \nhay. As Pritchard explained: “When I’m \nbuying in hay, I’m trading cash for \nanimal protein, as well as manure (once \nit passes through the animals’  system), \nwhich means I am also getting more\n\nnutrients for my land in exchange for my \nmoney. I’m also avoiding compacting \nsoils by driving heavy machinery over \nmy ground all summer long.”\nWhen making his final decision on \nthe baler, Pritchard moved past the \ndirect monetary costs, which were \nessentially a wash, and instead shifted \nhis attention to the more nuanced issue of \nthe long-term health of his fields. For the \nreasons described previously, Pritchard \nconcluded that buying in hay results in \nhealthier fields. And as he summarized: \n“Soil fertility is my baseline.” By this \ncalculation, the baler had to go.\nNotice the complexity of Pritchard’s \ntool decision. This complexity\n\nunderscores an important reality: The \nnotion that identifying some  benefit is \nsufficient to invest money, time, and \nattention in a tool is near laughable to \npeople in his trade. O f course  a hay \nbaler offers benefits — every  tool at the \nfarm supply store has something useful \nto offer. At the same time, o f course  it \noffers negatives as well. Pritchard \nexpected this decision to be nuanced. He \nbegan with a clear baseline—in his \ncase, that soil health is of fundamental \nimportance to his professional success \n—and then built off this foundation \ntoward a final call on whether to use a \nparticular tool.\nI propose that if you’re a knowledge\n\nworker—especially one interested in \ncultivating a deep work habit—you \nshould treat your tool selection with the \nsame level of care as other skilled \nworkers, such as farmers. Following is \nmy attempt to generalize this assessment \nstrategy. I call it the craftsman approach  \nto tool selection, a name that emphasizes \nthat tools are ultimately aids to the larger \ngoals of one’s craft.\nThe Craftsman Approach to Tool  \nSelection: Identify the core factors that \ndetermine success and happiness in your \nprofessional and personal life. Adopt a tool \nonly if its positive impacts on these factors \nsubstantially outweigh its negative\n\nimpacts.\nNotice that this craftsman approach \nto tool selection stands in opposition to \nthe any-benefit approach. Whereas the \nany-benefit mind-set identifies any \npotential positive impact as justification \nfor using a tool, the craftsman variant \nrequires that these positive impacts \naffect factors at the core of what’s \nimportant to you and that they outweigh \nthe negatives.\nEven though the craftsman approach \nrejects the simplicity of the any-benefit \napproach, it doesn’t ignore the benefits \nthat currently drive people to network \ntools, or make any advance\n\nproclamations about what’s “good” or \n“bad” technology: It simply asks that you \ngive any particular network tool the \nsame type of measured, nuanced \naccounting that tools in other trades have \nbeen subjected to throughout the history \nof skilled labor.\nThe three strategies that follow in this \nrule are designed to grow your comfort \nwith abandoning",

    "text": " \nIf a farmer subscribed to the any-benefit \napproach used by knowledge workers, \ntherefore, he would definitely buy a hay \nbaler. But as Pritchard explained to me \n(after preemptively apologizing for a \nmoment of snark), if a farmer actually \nadopted such a simplistic mind-set, “I’d\n\nbe counting the days until the ‘For Sale’  \nsign goes up on the property.” Pritchard, \nlike most practitioners of his trade, \ninstead deploys a more sophisticated \nthought process when assessing tools. \nAnd after applying this process to the \nhay baler, Pritchard was quick to sell it: \nSmith Meadows now purchases all the \nhay it uses.\nHere  S  why...\n“Let’s start by exploring the costs of \nmaking hay,” Pritchard said. “First, \nthere’s the actual cost of fuel, and \nrepairs, and the shed to keep the baler. \nYou also have to pay taxes on it.” These \ndirectly measurable costs, however, \nwere the easy part of his decision. It was\n\ninstead the “opportunity costs” that \nrequired more attention. As he \nelaborated: “If I make hay all summer, I \ncan’t be doing something else. For \nexample, I now use that time instead to \nraise boilers [chickens meant for eating]. \nThese generate positive cash flow, \nbecause I can sell them But they also \nproduce manure which I can then use to \nenhance my soil.” Then there’s the \nequally subtle issue of assessing the \nsecondary value of a purchased bale of \nhay. As Pritchard explained: “When I’m \nbuying in hay, I’m trading cash for \nanimal protein, as well as manure (once \nit passes through the animals’  system), \nwhich means I am also getting more\n\nnutrients for my land in exchange for my \nmoney. I’m also avoiding compacting \nsoils by driving heavy machinery over \nmy ground all summer long.”\nWhen making his final decision on \nthe baler, Pritchard moved past the \ndirect monetary costs, which were \nessentially a wash, and instead shifted \nhis attention to the more nuanced issue of \nthe long-term health of his fields. For the \nreasons described previously, Pritchard \nconcluded that buying in hay results in \nhealthier fields. And as he summarized: \n“So",

For \nexample, I now use that time instead to \nraise boilers [chickens meant for eating]. \nThese generate positive cash flow, \nbecause I can sell them But they also \nproduce manure which I can then use to \nenhance my soil.” Then there’s the \nequally subtle issue of assessing the \nsecondary value of a purchased bale of \nhay. As Pritchard explained: “When I’m \nbuying in hay, I’m trading cash for \nanimal protein, as well as manure (once \nit passes through the animals’  system), \nwhich means I am also getting more\n\nnutrients for my land in exchange for my \nmoney. I’m also avoiding compacting \nsoils by driving heavy machinery over \nmy ground all summer long.”\nWhen making his final decision on \nthe baler, Pritchard moved past the \ndirect monetary costs, which were \nessentially a wash, and instead shifted",

    "text": " \nhis attention to the more nuanced issue of \nthe long-term health of his fields. For the \nreasons described previously, Pritchard \nconcluded that buying in hay results in \nhealthier fields. And as he summarized: \n“Soil fertility is my baseline.” By this \ncalculation, the baler had to go.\nNotice the complexity of Pritchard’s \ntool decision. This complexity\n\nunderscores an important reality: The \nnotion that identifying some  benefit is \nsufficient to invest money, time, and \nattention in a tool is near laughable to \npeople in his trade. O f course  a hay \nbaler offers benefits — every  tool at the \nfarm supply store has something useful \nto offer. At the same time, o f course  it \noffers negatives as well. Pritchard \nexpected this decision to be nuanced. He \nbegan with a clear baseline—in his \ncase, that soil health is of fundamental \nimportance to his professional success \n—and then built off this foundation \ntoward a final call on whether to use a \nparticular tool.\nI propose that if you’re a knowledge\n\nworker—especially one interested in \ncultivating a deep work habit—you \nshould treat your tool selection with the \nsame level of care as other skilled \nworkers, such as farmers. Following is \nmy attempt to generalize this assessment \nstrategy. I call it the craftsman approach  \nto tool selection, a name that emphasizes \nthat tools are ultimately aids to the larger \ngoals of one’s craft.\nThe Craftsman Approach to Tool  \nSelection: Identify the core factors that \ndetermine success and happiness in your \nprofessional and personal life. Adopt a tool \nonly if its positive impacts on these factors \nsubstantially outweigh its negative\n\nimpacts.\nNotice that this craftsman approach \nto tool selection stands in opposition to \nthe any-benefit approach. Whereas the \nany-benefit mind-set identifies any \npotential positive impact as justification \nfor using a tool, the craftsman variant \nrequires that these positive impacts \naffect factors at the core of what’s \nimportant to you and that they outweigh \nthe negatives.\nEven though the craftsman approach \nrejects the simplicity of the any-benefit \napproach, it doesn’t ignore the benefits \nthat currently drive people to network \ntools, or make any advance\n\nproclamations about what’s “good” or \n“bad” technology: It simply asks that you \ngive any",

For the \nreasons described previously, Pritchard \nconcluded that buying in hay results in \nhealthier fields. And as he summarized: \n“Soil fertility is my baseline.” By this \ncalculation, the baler had to go.\nNotice the complexity of Pritchard’s \ntool decision. This complexity\n\nunderscores an important reality: The \nnotion that identifying some  benefit is \nsufficient to invest money, time, and \nattention in a tool is near laughable to \npeople in his trade. O f course  a hay \nbaler offers benefits — every  tool at the \nfarm supply store has something useful \nto offer. At the same time, o f course  it \noffers negatives as well. Pritchard \nexpected this decision to be nuanced. He \nbegan with a clear baseline—in his \ncase, that soil health is of fundamental \nimportance to his professional success \n—and then built off this foundation \ntoward a final call on whether to use a \nparticular tool.\nI propose that if you’re a knowledge\n\nworker—especially one interested in \ncultivating a deep work habit—you \nshould treat",

    "text": " success \n—and then built off this foundation \ntoward a final call on whether to use a \nparticular tool.\nI propose that if you’re a knowledge\n\nworker—especially one interested in \ncultivating a deep work habit—you \nshould treat your tool selection with the \nsame level of care as other skilled \nworkers, such as farmers. Following is \nmy attempt to generalize this assessment \nstrategy. I call it the craftsman approach  \nto tool selection, a name that emphasizes \nthat tools are ultimately aids to the larger \ngoals of one’s craft.\nThe Craftsman Approach to Tool  \nSelection: Identify the core factors that \ndetermine success and happiness in your \nprofessional and personal life. Adopt a tool \nonly if its positive impacts on these factors \nsubstantially outweigh its negative\n\nimpacts.\nNotice that this craftsman approach \nto tool selection stands in opposition to \nthe any-benefit approach. Whereas the \nany-benefit mind-set identifies any \npotential positive impact as justification \nfor using a tool, the craftsman variant \nrequires that these positive impacts \naffect factors at the core of what’s \nimportant to you and that they outweigh \nthe negatives.\nEven though the craftsman approach \nrejects the simplicity of the any-benefit",

    "text": " particular network tool the \nsame type of measured, nuanced \naccounting that tools in other trades have \nbeen subjected to throughout the history \nof skilled labor.\nThe three strategies that follow in this \nrule are designed to grow your comfort \nwith abandoning the any-benefit mind­\nset and instead applying the more \nthoughtful craftsman philosophy in \ncurating the tools that lay claim to your \ntime and attention. This guidance is \nimportant because the craftsman \napproach is not cut-and-dry. Identifying\n\nwhat matters most in your life, and then \nattempting to assess the impacts of \nvarious tools on these factors, doesn’t \nreduce to a simple formula—this task \nrequires practice and experimentation. \nThe strategies that follow provide some \nstructure for this practice and \nexperimentation by forcing you to \nreconsider your network tools from \nmany different angles. Combined, they \nshould help you cultivate a more \nsophisticated relationship with your \ntools that will allow you to take back \nenough control over your time and \nattention to enable the rest of the ideas in \nPart 2 to succeed.\n\nApply the Law of the Vital \nFew to Your Internet Habits\nMalcolm Gladwell doesn’t use Twitter. \nIn a 2013 interview he explained why: \n“Who says my fans want to hear from me \non Twitter?” He then joked: “I know a \nlot o f people would like to see less of \nme.” Michael Lewis, another mega­\nbestselling author, also doesn’t use the \nservice, explaining in The Wire: “I don’t \ntweet, I don’t Twitter, I couldn’t even \ntell you how to read or where to find a \nTwitter message.” And as mentioned in \nPart 1, the award-winning New Yorker  \nscribe George Packer also avoids the \nservice, and indeed only recently even\n\nsuccumbed to the necessity of owning a \nsmartphone.\nThese three writers don’t think \nTwitter is useless. They’re quick to \naccept that other writers find it useful. \nPacker’s admission of non-Twitter use, \nin fact, was written as a response to an \nunabashedly pro-Twitter article by the \nlate New York Times  media critic David \nCarr, a piece in which Carr effused:\nAnd now, nearly a year later, has  \nTwitter turned my brain to  \nmush? No, I ’ m in narrative on  \nmore things in a given moment  \nthan I  ever thought possible, and  \ninstead o f spending a half-hour\n\nsurfing in search o f illumination,  \nI  get a sense o f the day S news  \nand how people are reacting to it  \nin the time that it takes to wait  \nfo r coffee at Starbucks.\nAt the same time, however, \nGladwell, Lewis, and Packer don’t feel \nlike the service offers them nearly \nenough advantages to offset its negatives \nin their particular circumstances. Lewis, \nfor example, worries that adding more \naccessibility will sap his energy and \nreduce his ability to research and write \ngreat stories, noting: “It’s amazing how \noverly accessible people are. There’s a \nlot of communication in my life that’s not\n\nenriching, it’s impoverishing.” While \nPacker, for his part, worries about \ndistraction, saying: “Twitter is crack for \nmedia addicts.” He goes so far as to \ndescribe Carr’s rave about the service \nas “the most frightening picture of the \nfuture that I’ve read thus far in the new \ndecade.”\nWe don’t have to argue about \nwhether these authors are right in their \npersonal decisions to avoid Twitter (and \nsimilar tools), because their sales \nnumbers and awards speak for\nthemselves. We can instead use these \ndecisions as a courageous illustration of \nthe craftsman approach to tool selection \nin action. In a time when so many\n\nknowledge workers—and especially \nthose in creative fields— are still \ntrapped in the any-benefit mind-set, it’s \nrefreshing to see a more mature \napproach to sorting through such \nservices. But the very rareness of these \nexamples reminds us that mature and \nconfident assessments of this type aren’t \neasy to make. Recall the complexity of \nthe thought process, highlighted earlier, \nthat Forrest Pritchard had to slog through \nto make a decision on his hay baler: For \nmany knowledge workers, and many of \nthe tools in their lives, these decisions \nwill be equally complex. The goal of \nthis strategy, therefore, is to offer some \nstructure to this thought process—a way\n\nto reduce some of the complexity of \ndeciding which tools really matter to \nyou.\nThe first step of this strategy is to \nidentify the main high-level goals in both \nyour professional and your personal life. \nIf you have a family, for example,",

This guidance is \nimportant because the craftsman \napproach is not cut-and-dry. Identifying\n\nwhat matters most in your life, and then \nattempting to assess the impacts of \nvarious tools on these factors, doesn’t \nreduce to a simple formula—this task \nrequires practice and experimentation. \nThe strategies that follow provide some \nstructure for this practice and \nexperimentation by forcing you to \nreconsider your network tools from \nmany different angles. Combined, they \nshould help you cultivate a more \nsophisticated relationship with your \ntools that will allow you to take back \nenough control over your time and \nattention to enable the rest of the ideas in \nPart 2 to succeed.\n\nApply the Law of the Vital \nFew to Your Internet Habits\nMalcolm Gladwell doesn’t use Twitter. \nIn a 2013 interview he explained why: \n“Who says my fans want to hear from me \non Twitter?” He then joked: “I know a \nlot o f people would like to see less of \nme.” Michael Lewis, another mega­\nbestselling author, also doesn’t use the \nservice, explaining in The Wire: “I don’t \ntweet, I don’t Twitter, I couldn’t even \ntell you how to read or where to find a \nTwitter message.” And as mentioned in \nPart 1, the award-winning New Yorker  \nscribe George Packer also avoids the \nservice, and indeed only recently even\n\nsuccumbed to the necessity of owning a \nsmartphone.\nThese three writers don’t think \nTwitter is useless. They’re quick to \naccept that other writers find it useful. \nPacker’s admission of non-Twitter use, \nin fact, was written as a response to an \nunabashedly pro-Twitter article by the \nlate New York Times  media critic David \nCarr, a piece in which Carr effused:\nAnd now, nearly a year later, has  \nTwitter turned my brain to  \nmush?

This guidance is \nimportant because the craftsman \napproach is not cut-and-dry. Identifying\n\nwhat matters most in your life, and then \nattempting to assess the impacts of \nvarious tools on these factors, doesn’t \nreduce to a simple formula—this task \nrequires practice and experimentation. \nThe strategies that follow provide some \nstructure for this practice and \nexperimentation by forcing you to \nreconsider your network tools from \nmany different angles. Combined, they \nshould help you cultivate a more \nsophisticated relationship with your \ntools that will allow you to take back \nenough control over your time and \nattention to enable the rest of the ideas in \nPart 2 to succeed.\n\nApply the Law of the Vital \nFew to Your Internet Habits\nMalcolm Gladwell doesn’t use Twitter.",

    "text": " York Times  media critic David \nCarr, a piece in which Carr effused:\nAnd now, nearly a year later, has  \nTwitter turned my brain to  \nmush? No, I ’ m in narrative on  \nmore things in a given moment  \nthan I  ever thought possible, and  \ninstead o f spending a half-hour\n\nsurfing in search o f illumination,  \nI  get a sense o f the day S news  \nand how people are reacting to it  \nin the time that it takes to wait  \nfo r coffee at Starbucks.\nAt the same time, however, \nGladwell, Lewis, and Packer don’t feel \nlike the service offers them nearly \nenough advantages to offset its negatives \nin their particular circumstances. Lewis, \nfor example, worries that adding more \naccessibility will sap his energy and \nreduce his ability to research and write \ngreat stories, noting: “It’s amazing how \noverly accessible people are. There’s a \nlot of communication in my life that’s not\n\nenriching, it’s impoverishing.” While \nPacker, for his part, worries about \ndistraction, saying: “Twitter is crack for \nmedia addicts.” He goes so far as to \ndescribe Carr’s rave about the service \nas “the most frightening picture of the \nfuture that I’ve read thus far in the new \ndecade.”\nWe don’t have to argue about \nwhether these authors are right in their \npersonal decisions to avoid Twitter (and \nsimilar tools), because their sales \nnumbers and awards speak for\nthemselves. We can instead use these \ndecisions as a courageous illustration of \nthe craftsman approach to tool selection \nin action. In a time when so many\n\nknowledge workers—and especially \nthose in creative fields— are still \ntrapped in the any-benefit mind-set, it’s \nrefreshing to see a more mature \napproach to sorting through such \nservices. But the very rareness of these \nexamples reminds us that mature and \nconfident assessments of this type aren’t \neasy to make. Recall the complexity of \nthe thought process, highlighted earlier, \nthat Forrest Pritchard had to slog through \nto make a decision on his hay baler: For \nmany knowledge workers, and many of \nthe tools in their lives, these decisions \nwill be equally complex. The goal of \nthis strategy, therefore, is to offer some \nstructure to this thought process—a way\n\nto reduce some",

    "text": " in my life that’s not\n\nenriching, it’s impoverishing.” While \nPacker, for his part, worries about \ndistraction, saying: “Twitter is crack for \nmedia addicts.” He goes so far as to \ndescribe Carr’s rave about the service \nas “the most frightening picture of the \nfuture that I’ve read thus far in the new \ndecade.”\nWe don’t have to argue about \nwhether these authors are right in their \npersonal decisions to avoid Twitter (and \nsimilar tools), because their sales \nnumbers and awards speak for\nthemselves. We can instead use these \ndecisions as a courageous illustration of \nthe craftsman approach to tool selection \nin action. In a time when so many\n\nknowledge workers—and especially \nthose in creative fields— are still \ntrapped in the any-benefit mind-set, it’s \nrefreshing to see a more mature \napproach to sorting through such \nservices. But the very rareness of these \nexamples reminds us that mature and \nconfident assessments of this type aren’t \neasy to make. Recall the complexity of \nthe thought process, highlighted earlier, \nthat Forrest Pritchard had to slog through \nto make a decision on his hay baler",

    "text": " of the complexity of \ndeciding which tools really matter to \nyou.\nThe first step of this strategy is to \nidentify the main high-level goals in both \nyour professional and your personal life. \nIf you have a family, for example, then \nyour personal goals might involve \nparenting well and running an organized \nhousehold. In the professional sphere, \nthe details of these goals depend on what \nyou do for a living. In my own work as a \nprofessor, for example, I pursue two \nimportant goals, one centered on being \nan effective teacher in the classroom and \neffective mentor to my graduate students,\n\nand another centered on being an \neffective researcher. While your goals \nwill likely differ, the key is to keep the \nlist limited to what’s most important and \nto keep the descriptions suitably high- \nlevel. (If your goal includes a specific \ntarget—“to reach a million dollars in \nsales” or “to publish a half dozen papers \nin a single year”—then it’s too specific \nfor our purposes here.) When you’re \ndone you should have a small number of \ngoals for both the personal and \nprofessional areas of your life.\nOnce you’ve identified these goals, \nlist for each the two or three most \nimportant activities that help you satisfy \nthe goal. These activities should be\n\nspecific enough to allow you to clearly \npicture doing them. On the other hand, \nthey should be general enough that \nthey’re not tied to a onetime outcome. \nFor example, “do better research” is too \ngeneral (what does it look like to be \n“doing better research”?), while “finish \npaper on broadcast lower bounds in time \nfor upcoming conference submission” is \ntoo specific (it’s a onetime outcome). A \ngood activity in this context would be \nsomething like: “regularly read and \nunderstand the cutting-edge results in my \nfield.”\nThe next step in this strategy is to \nconsider the network tools you currently \nuse. For each such tool, go through the\n\nkey activities you identified and ask \nwhether the use of the tool has a \nsubstantially positive impact , a \nsubstantially negative impact , or little  \nimpact  on your regular and successful \nparticipation in the activity. Now comes \nthe important decision: Keep using this \ntool only if you concluded that it has \nsubstantial positive impacts and that \nthese outweigh the negative impacts.\nTo help illustrate this strategy in \naction, let’s consider a case study. For \nthe purposes of this example, assume \nthat Michael Lewis, if asked, would \nhave produced the following goal and \ncorresponding important activities for \nhis writing career.\n\nProfessional Goal:  To craft well- \nwritten, narrative-driven stories that \nchange the way people understand the \nworld.\nKey Activities Supporting This Goal:\n• Research patiently and deeply.\n• Write carefully and with purpose.\nNow imagine that Lewis was using \nthis goal to determine whether or not to \nuse Twitter. Our strategy requires him to \ninvestigate Twitter’s impact on the key \nactivities he listed that support his goal. \nThere’s no convincing way to argue that \nTwitter would make Lewis substantially \nbetter at either of these activities. Deep\n\nresearch for Lewis, I assume, requires \nhim to spend weeks and months getting \nto know a small number of sources (he’s \na master of the long-form journalism \nskill of drawing out a source’s story \nover many sessions), and careful \nwriting, of course, requires freedom \nfrom distraction. In both cases, Twitter \nat best has no real impact, and at worst \ncould be substantially negative, \ndepending on Lewis’s susceptibility to \nthe service’s addictive attributes. The \nconclusion would therefore be that \nLewis shouldn’t use Twitter.\nYou might argue at this point that \nconfining our example to this single goal \nis artificial, as it ignores the areas where\n\na service like Twitter has its best chance \nof contributing. For writers, in \nparticular, Twitter is often presented as a \ntool to establish connections with your \naudience that ultimately lead to more \nsales. For a writer like Michael Lewis, \nhowever, marketing doesn’t likely merit \nits own goal when he assesses what’s \nimportant in his professional life. This \nfollows because his reputation \nguarantees that he will receive massive \ncoverage in massively influential media \nchannels, if the book is really good. His \nfocus, therefore, is much more \nproductively applied to the goal of \nwriting the best possible book than \ninstead trying to squeeze out a few extra\n\nsales through inefficient author-driven \nmeans. In other words, the question is \nnot whether Twitter has some \nconceivable benefit to Lewis; it’s \ninstead whether Twitter use significantly \nand positively affects the most important \nactivities in his professional life.\nWhat about a less famous writer? In \nthis case, book marketing might play a",

    "text": " of the complexity of \ndeciding which tools really matter to \nyou.\nThe first step of this strategy is to \nidentify the main high-level goals in both \nyour professional and your personal life. \nIf you have a family, for example, then \nyour personal goals might involve \nparenting well and running an organized \nhousehold. In the professional sphere, \nthe details of these goals depend on what \nyou do for a living. In my own work as a \nprofessor, for example, I pursue two \nimportant goals, one centered on being \nan effective teacher in the classroom and \neffective mentor to my graduate students,\n\nand another centered on being an \neffective researcher. While your goals \nwill likely differ, the key is to keep the \nlist limited to what’s most important and \nto keep the descriptions suitably high- \nlevel. (If your goal includes a specific \ntarget—“to reach a million dollars in \nsales” or “to publish a half dozen papers \nin a single year”—then it’s too specific \nfor our purposes here.) When you’re \ndone you should have a small number of \ngoals for both the personal and \nprofessional areas of your life.\nOnce you’ve identified these goals, \nlist for each the two or three most \nimportant activities that help you satisfy \nthe goal. These activities should be\n\nspecific enough to allow you to clearly \npicture doing them. On the other hand, \nthey should be general enough that \nthey’re not tied to a onetime outcome. \nFor example, “do better research” is too \ngeneral (what does it look like to be \n“doing better research”?), while “finish \npaper on broadcast lower bounds in time \nfor upcoming conference submission” is \ntoo specific (it’s a onetime outcome). A \ngood activity in this context would be \nsomething like: “regularly read and \nunderstand the cutting-edge results in my \nfield.”\nThe next step in this strategy is to \nconsider the network tools you currently \nuse. For each such tool, go through the\n\nkey activities you identified and ask \nwhether the use of the tool has a \nsubstantially positive impact , a \nsubstantially negative impact , or little  \nimpact  on your regular and successful \nparticipation in the activity. Now comes \nthe important decision: Keep using this \ntool only if you concluded that it has \nsubstantial positive impacts and that \nthese outweigh the negative impacts.\nTo help illustrate this strategy",

When you’re \ndone you should have a small number of \ngoals for both the personal and \nprofessional areas of your life.\nOnce you’ve identified these goals, \nlist for each the two or three most \nimportant activities that help you satisfy \nthe goal. These activities should be\n\nspecific enough to allow you to clearly \npicture doing them. On the other hand, \nthey should be general enough that \nthey’re not tied to a onetime outcome. \nFor example, “do better research” is too \ngeneral (what does it look like to be \n“doing better research”?), while “finish \npaper on broadcast lower bounds in time \nfor upcoming conference submission” is \ntoo specific (it’s a onetime outcome). A \ngood activity in this context would be \nsomething like: “regularly read and \nunderstand the cutting-edge results in my \nfield.”\nThe next step in this strategy is to \nconsider the network tools you currently \nuse. For each such tool, go through the\n\nkey activities you identified and ask \nwhether the use of the tool has a \nsubstantially positive impact , a \nsubstantially negative impact , or little  \nimpact ",

    "text": " on your regular and successful \nparticipation in the activity. Now comes \nthe important decision: Keep using this \ntool only if you concluded that it has \nsubstantial positive impacts and that \nthese outweigh the negative impacts.\nTo help illustrate this strategy in \naction, let’s consider a case study. For \nthe purposes of this example, assume \nthat Michael Lewis, if asked, would \nhave produced the following goal and \ncorresponding important activities for \nhis writing career.\n\nProfessional Goal:  To craft well- \nwritten, narrative-driven stories that \nchange the way people understand the \nworld.\nKey Activities Supporting This Goal:\n• Research patiently and deeply.\n• Write carefully and with purpose.\nNow imagine that Lewis was using \nthis goal to determine whether or not to \nuse Twitter. Our strategy requires him to \ninvestigate Twitter’s impact on the key \nactivities he listed that support his goal. \nThere’s no convincing way to argue that \nTwitter would make Lewis substantially \nbetter at either of these activities. Deep\n\nresearch for Lewis, I assume, requires \nhim to spend weeks and months getting \nto know a small number of sources (he’s \na master of the long-form journalism \nskill of drawing out a source’s story \nover many sessions), and careful \nwriting, of course, requires freedom \nfrom distraction. In both cases, Twitter \nat best has no real impact, and at worst \ncould be substantially negative, \ndepending on Lewis’s susceptibility to \nthe service’s addictive attributes. The \nconclusion would therefore be that \nLewis shouldn’t use Twitter.\nYou might argue at this point that \nconfining our example to this single goal \nis artificial, as it ignores the areas where\n\na service like Twitter has its best chance \nof contributing. For writers, in \nparticular, Twitter is often presented as a \ntool to establish connections with your \naudience that ultimately lead to more \nsales. For a writer like Michael Lewis, \nhowever, marketing doesn’t likely merit \nits own goal when he assesses what’s \nimportant in his professional life. This \nfollows because his reputation \nguarantees that he will receive massive \ncoverage in massively influential media \nchannels, if the book is really good. His \nfocus, therefore, is much more \nproductively applied to the goal of \nwriting the best possible book than \ninstead trying to squeeze out a few extra\n\nsales through inefficient author-driven \nmeans. In other words, the question is \nnot whether",

The \nconclusion would therefore be that \nLewis shouldn’t use Twitter.\nYou might argue at this point that \nconfining our example to this single goal \nis artificial, as it ignores the areas where\n\na service like Twitter has its best chance \nof contributing. For writers, in \nparticular, Twitter is often presented as a \ntool to establish connections with your \naudience that ultimately lead to more \nsales. For a writer like Michael Lewis, \nhowever, marketing doesn’t likely merit \nits own goal when he assesses what’s \nimportant in his professional life.

    "text": " Twitter has some \nconceivable benefit to Lewis; it’s \ninstead whether Twitter use significantly \nand positively affects the most important \nactivities in his professional life.\nWhat about a less famous writer? In \nthis case, book marketing might play a \nmore primary role in his or her goals. \nBut when forced to identify the two or \nthree most important activities \nsupporting this goal, it’s unlikely that the \ntype o f lightweight one-on-one contact \nenabled by Twitter would make the list. \nThis is the result o f simple math. \nImagine that our hypothetical author\n\ndiligently sends ten individualized \ntweets a day, five days a week—each of \nwhich connects one-on-one with a new \npotential reader. Now imagine that 50 \npercent of the people contacted in this \nmanner become loyal fans who will \ndefinitely buy the author’s next book. \nOver the two-year period it might take to \nwrite this book, this yields two thousand \nsales—a modest boost at best in a \nmarketplace where bestseller status \nrequires two or three times more sales \nper week.  The question once again is not \nwhether Twitter offers some  benefits, but \ninstead whether it offers enough  benefits \nto offset its drag on your time and \nattention (two resources that are\n\nespecially valuable to a writer).\nHaving seen an example of this \napproach applied to a professional \ncontext, let’s next consider the \npotentially more disruptive setting of \npersonal goals. In particular, let’s apply \nthis approach to one of our culture’s \nmost ubiquitous and fiercely defended \ntools: Facebook.\nWhen justifying the use of Facebook \n(or similar social networks), most \npeople cite its importance to their social \nlives. With this in mind, let’s apply our \nstrategy to understand whether Facebook \nmakes the cut due to its positive impact \non this aspect of our personal goals. To \ndo so, we’ll once again work with a\n\nhypothetical goal and key supporting \nactivities.\nPersonal Goal:  To maintain close and \nrewarding friendships with a group of \npeople who are important to me.\nKey Activities Supporting This Goal:\n1. Regularly take the time for \nmeaningful connection with those \nwho are most important to me \n(e.g., a long talk, a meal, joint \nactivity).\n2. Give of myself to those who are \nmost important to me (e.g., \nmaking nontrivial sacrifices that\n\nimprove their lives).\nNot everyone will share this exact \ngoal or supporting activities, but \nhopefully you’ll stipulate that they apply \nto many people. Let’s now step back and \napply our strategy’s filtering logic to the \nexample of Facebook in the context of \nthis personal goal. This service, of \ncourse, offers any number of benefits to \nyour social life. To name a few that are \noften mentioned: It allows you to catch \nup with people you haven’t seen in a \nwhile, it allows you to maintain \nlightweight contact with people you \nknow but don’t run into regularly, it \nallows you to more easily monitor\n\nimportant events in people’s lives (such \nas whether or not they’re married or \nwhat their new baby looks like), and it \nallows you to stumble onto online \ncommunities or groups that match your \ninterests.\nThese are real benefits that Facebook \nundeniably offers, but none of these \nbenefits provide a significant positive \nimpact to the two key activities we \nlisted, both of which are offline and \neffort intensive. Our strategy, therefore, \nwould return a perhaps surprising but \nclear conclusion: O f course Facebook  \noffers benefits to your social life, but  \nnone are important enough to what  \nreally matters to you in this area to\n\njustify giving it access to your time and\njjj\nattention. -\nTo be clear, I’m not arguing that \neveryone should stop using Facebook. \nI’m instead showing that for this specific \n(representative) case study, the strategy \nproposed here would suggest dropping \nthis service. I can imagine, however, \nother plausible scenarios that would \nlead to the opposite conclusion. \nConsider, for example, a college \nfreshman. For someone in this situation, \nit might be more important to establish \nnew friendships than to support existing \nrelationships. The activities this student \nidentifies for supporting his goal of a \nthriving social life, therefore, might\n\ninclude something like, “attend lots of \nevents and socialize with lots of \ndifferent people.” If this is a key activity, \nand you’re on a college campus, then a \ntool like Facebook would have a \nsubstantially positive impact and should  \nbe used.\nTo give another example, consider \nsomeone in the military who’s deployed \noverseas. For this hypothetical soldier, \nkeeping in frequent lightweight touch \nwith friends and family left back home is \na plausible priority, and one",

In \nthis case, book marketing might play a \nmore primary role in his or her goals. \nBut when forced to identify the two or \nthree most important activities \nsupporting this goal, it’s unlikely that the \ntype o f lightweight one-on-one contact \nenabled by Twitter would make the list. \nThis is the result o f simple math. \nImagine that our hypothetical author\n\ndiligently sends ten individualized \ntweets a day, five days a week—each of \nwhich connects one-on-one with a new \npotential reader. Now imagine that 50 \npercent of the people contacted in this \nmanner become loyal fans who will \ndefinitely buy the author’s next book. \nOver the two-year period it might take to \nwrite this book, this yields two thousand \nsales—a modest boost at best in a \nmarketplace where bestseller status \nrequires two or three times more sales \nper week.  The question once again is not \nwhether Twitter offers some  benefits, but \ninstead whether it offers enough  benefits \nto offset its drag on your time and \nattention (two resources that are\n\nespecially valuable to a writer).\nHaving seen an example of this \napproach applied to a professional \ncontext, let’s next consider the \npotentially more disruptive setting of \npersonal goals. In particular, let’s apply \nthis approach to one of our culture’s \nmost ubiquitous and fiercely defended \ntools: Facebook.\nWhen justifying the use of Facebook \n(or similar social networks), most \npeople cite its importance to their social \nlives. With this in mind, let’s apply our \nstrategy to understand whether Facebook \nmakes the cut due to its positive impact \non this aspect of our personal goals. To \ndo so, we’ll once again work with a\n\nhypothetical goal and key supporting \nactivities.\nPersonal Goal:  To maintain close and \nrewarding friendships with a group of \npeople who are important to me.\nKey Activities Supporting This Goal:\n1. Regularly take the time for \nmeaningful connection with those \nwho are most important to me \n(e.g., a long talk, a meal, joint \nactivity).\n2. Give of myself to those who are \nmost important to me (e.g., \nmaking nontrivial sacrifices that\n\nimprove their",

    "text": " Twitter has some \nconceivable benefit to Lewis; it’s \ninstead whether Twitter use significantly \nand positively affects the most important \nactivities in his professional life.\nWhat about a less famous writer? In \nthis case, book marketing might play a \nmore primary role in his or her goals. \nBut when forced to identify the two or \nthree most important activities \nsupporting this goal, it’s unlikely that the \ntype o f lightweight one-on-one contact \nenabled by Twitter would make the list. \nThis is the result o f simple math. \nImagine that our hypothetical author\n\ndiligently sends ten individualized \ntweets a day, five days a week—each of \nwhich connects one-on-one with a new \npotential reader. Now imagine that 50 \npercent of the people contacted in this \nmanner become loyal fans who will \ndefinitely buy the author’s next book. \nOver the two-year period it might take to \nwrite this book, this yields two thousand \nsales—a modest boost at best in a \nmarketplace where bestseller status \nrequires two or three times more sales \nper week.  The question once again is not \nwhether Twitter offers some  benefits, but \ninstead whether it offers enough  benefits \nto",

The question once again is not \nwhether Twitter offers some  benefits, but \ninstead whether it offers enough  benefits \nto offset its drag on your time and \nattention (two resources that are\n\nespecially valuable to a writer).\nHaving seen an example of this \napproach applied to a professional \ncontext, let’s next consider the \npotentially more disruptive setting of \npersonal goals. In particular, let’s apply \nthis approach to one of our culture’s \nmost ubiquitous and fiercely defended \ntools: Facebook.\nWhen justifying the use of Facebook \n(or similar social networks), most \npeople cite its importance to their social \nlives. With this in mind, let’s apply our \nstrategy to understand whether Facebook \nmakes the cut due to its positive impact \non this aspect of our personal goals. To \ndo so, we’ll once again work with a\n\nhypothetical goal and key supporting \nactivities.\nPersonal Goal:  To maintain close and \nrewarding friendships with a group of \npeople who are important to me.\nKey Activities Supporting This Goal:\n1. Regularly take the time for \nmeaningful connection with those \n",

Let’s now step back and \napply our strategy’s filtering logic to the \nexample of Facebook in the context of \nthis personal goal. This service, of \ncourse, offers any number of benefits to \nyour social life. To name a few that are \noften mentioned: It allows you to catch \nup with people you haven’t seen in a \nwhile, it allows you to maintain \nlightweight contact with people you \nknow but don’t run into regularly, it \nallows you to more easily monitor\n\nimportant events in people’s lives (such \nas whether or not they’re married or \nwhat their new baby looks like), and it \nallows you to stumble onto online \ncommunities or groups that match your \ninterests.\nThese are real benefits that Facebook \nundeniably offers, but none of these \nbenefits provide a significant positive \nimpact to the two key activities we \nlisted, both of which are offline and \neffort intensive. Our strategy, therefore, \nwould return a perhaps surprising but \nclear conclusion: O f course Facebook  \noffers benefits to your social life, but  \nnone are important enough to what  \nreally matters to you in this area to\n\njustify giving it access to your time and\njjj\nattention. -\nTo be clear, I’m not arguing that \neveryone should stop using Facebook. \nI’m instead showing that for this specific \n(representative) case study, the strategy \nproposed here would suggest dropping \nthis service. I can imagine, however, \nother plausible scenarios that would \nlead to the opposite conclusion. \nConsider, for example, a college \nfreshman. For someone in this situation, \nit might be more important to establish \nnew friendships than to support existing \nrelationships. The activities this student \nidentifies for supporting his goal of a \nthriving social life, therefore, might\n\ninclude something like, “attend lots of \nevents and socialize with lots of \ndifferent people.” If this is a key activity, \nand you’re on a college campus, then a \ntool like Facebook would have a \nsubstantially positive impact and should",

    "text": "  \nbe used.\nTo give another example, consider \nsomeone in the military who’s deployed \noverseas. For this hypothetical soldier, \nkeeping in frequent lightweight touch \nwith friends and family left back home is \na plausible priority, and one that might \nonce again be best supported through \nsocial networks.\nWhat should be clear from these \nexamples is that this strategy, if applied\n\nas described, will lead many people \nwho currently use tools like Facebook or \nTwitter to abandon them—but not \neveryone. You might, at this point, \ncomplain about the arbitrariness of \nallowing only a small number of \nactivities to dominate your decisions \nabout such tools. As we established \npreviously, for example, Facebook has \nmany benefits to your social life; why \nwould one abandon it just because it \ndoesn’t happen to help the small number \nof activities that we judged most \nimportant? What’s key to understand \nhere, however, is that this radical \nreduction of priorities is not arbitrary, \nbut is instead motivated by an idea that\n\nhas arisen repeatedly in any number of \ndifferent fields, from client profitability \nto social equality to prevention of \ncrashes in computer programs.\nThe Law of the Vital Few *: In many \nsettings, 80 percent of a given effect is due \nto just 20 percent of the possible causes.\nFor example, it might be the case that \n80 percent of a business’s profits come \nfrom just 20 percent of its clients, 80 \npercent of a nation’s wealth is held by \nits richest 20 percent of citizens, or 80 \npercent of computer software crashes \ncome from just 20 percent of the \nidentified bugs. There’s a formal\n\nmathematical underpinning to this \nphenomenon (an 80/20 split is roughly \nwhat you would expect when describing \na power law  distribution over impact—a \ntype of distribution that shows up often \nwhen measuring quantities in the real \nworld), but it’s probably most useful \nwhen applied heuristically as a reminder \nthat, in many cases, contributions to an \noutcome are not evenly distributed.\nMoving forward, let’s assume that \nthis law holds for the important goals in \nyour life. As we noted, many different \nactivities can contribute to your \nachieving these goals. The law of the \nvital few, however, reminds us that the \nmost important 20 percent or so of these\n\nactivities provide the bulk of the benefit. \nAssuming that you could probably list \nsomewhere between ten and fifteen \ndistinct and potentially beneficial \nactivities for each of your life goals, this \nlaw says that it’s the top two or three \nsuch activities—the number that this \nstrategy asks you to focus on—that make \nmost of the difference in whether or not \nyou succeed with the goal.\nEven if you accept this result, \nhowever, you still might argue that you \nshouldn’t ignore the other 80 percent of \npossible beneficial activities. It’s true \nthat these less important activities don’t \ncontribute nearly as much to your goal as \nyour top one or two, but they can\n\nprovide some  benefit, so why not keep \nthem in the mix? As long as you don’t \nignore the more important activities, it \nseems like it can’t hurt to also support \nsome of the less important alternatives.\nThis argument, however, misses the \nkey point that all activities, regardless of \ntheir importance, consume your same \nlimited store of time and attention. If you \nservice low-impact activities, therefore, \nyou’re taking away time you could be \nspending on higher-impact activities. It’s \na zero-sum game. And because your time \nreturns substantially more rewards when \ninvested in high-impact activities than \nwhen invested in low-impact activities, \nthe more of it you shift to the latter, the\n\nlower your overall benefit.\nThe business world understands this \nmath. This is why it’s not uncommon to \nsee a company fire unproductive clients. \nIf 80 percent of their profits come from \n20 percent of their clients, then they \nmake more money by redirecting the \nenergy from low-revenue clients to \nbetter service the small number of \nlucrative contracts—each hour spent on \nthe latter returns more revenue than each \nhour spent on the former. The same holds \ntrue for your professional and personal \ngoals. By taking the time consumed by \nlow-impact activities— like finding old \nfriends on Facebook—and reinvesting in \nhigh-impact activities—like taking a\n\ngood friend out to lunch—you end up \nmore successful in your goal. To \nabandon a network tool using this logic, \ntherefore, is not to miss out on its \npotential small benefits, but is instead to \nget more out of the activities you already \nknow to yield large benefits.\nTo return to where we started,",

For this hypothetical soldier, \nkeeping in frequent lightweight touch \nwith friends and family left back home is \na plausible priority, and one that might \nonce again be best supported through \nsocial networks.\nWhat should be clear from these \nexamples is that this strategy, if applied\n\nas described, will lead many people \nwho currently use tools like Facebook or \nTwitter to abandon them—but not \neveryone. You might, at this point, \ncomplain about the arbitrariness of \nallowing only a small number of \nactivities to dominate your decisions \nabout such tools. As we established \npreviously, for example, Facebook has \nmany benefits to your social life; why \nwould one abandon it just because it \ndoesn’t happen to help the small number \nof activities that we judged most \nimportant? What’s key to understand \nhere, however, is that this radical \nreduction of priorities is not arbitrary, \nbut is instead motivated by an idea that\n\nhas arisen repeatedly in any number of \ndifferent fields, from client profitability \nto social equality to prevention of \ncrashes in computer programs.\nThe Law of the Vital Few *: In many \nsettings, 80 percent of a given effect is due \nto just 20 percent of the possible causes.\nFor example, it might be the case that \n80 percent of a business’s profits come \nfrom just 20 percent of its clients, 80 \npercent of a nation’s wealth is held by \nits richest 20 percent of citizens, or 80 \npercent of computer software crashes \ncome from just 20 percent of the \nidentified bugs. There’s a formal\n\nmathematical underpinning to this \nphenomenon (an 80/20 split is roughly \nwhat you would expect when describing \na power law  distribution over impact—a \ntype of distribution that shows up often \nwhen measuring quantities in the real \nworld), but it’s probably most useful \nwhen applied heuristically as a reminder \nthat, in many cases, contributions to an \noutcome are not evenly distributed.\nMoving forward, let’s assume that \nthis law holds for the important goals in \nyour life. As we noted, many different \nactivities can contribute to your \nachieving these goals. The law of the \nvital few, however, reminds us that the \nmost important 20 percent or so of these\n\nactivities provide the bulk",

You might, at this point, \ncomplain about the arbitrariness of \nallowing only a small number of \nactivities to dominate your decisions \nabout such tools. As we established \npreviously, for example, Facebook has \nmany benefits to your social life; why \nwould one abandon it just because it \ndoesn’t happen to help the small number \nof activities that we judged most \nimportant? What’s key to understand \nhere, however, is that this radical \nreduction of priorities is not arbitrary, \nbut is instead motivated by an idea that\n\nhas arisen repeatedly in any number of \ndifferent fields, from client profitability \nto social equality to prevention of \ncrashes in computer programs.\nThe Law of the Vital Few *:",

    "text": " life. As we noted, many different \nactivities can contribute to your \nachieving these goals. The law of the \nvital few, however, reminds us that the \nmost important 20 percent or so of these\n\nactivities provide the bulk of the benefit. \nAssuming that you could probably list \nsomewhere between ten and fifteen \ndistinct and potentially beneficial \nactivities for each of your life goals, this \nlaw says that it’s the top two or three \nsuch activities—the number that this \nstrategy asks you to focus on—that make \nmost of the difference in whether or not \nyou succeed with the goal.\nEven if you accept this result, \nhowever, you still might argue that you \nshouldn’t ignore the other 80 percent of \npossible beneficial activities. It’s true \nthat these less important activities don’t \ncontribute nearly as much to your goal as \nyour top one or two, but they can\n\nprovide some  benefit, so why not keep \nthem in the mix? As long as you don’t \nignore the more important activities, it \nseems like it can’t hurt to also support \nsome of the less important alternatives.\nThis argument, however, misses the \nkey point that all activities, regardless of \ntheir importance, consume your same \nlimited store of time and attention. If you \nservice low-impact activities, therefore, \nyou’re taking away time you could be \nspending on higher-impact activities. It’s \na zero-sum game. And because your time \nreturns substantially more rewards when \ninvested in high-impact activities than \nwhen invested in low-impact activities, \nthe more of it you shift to the latter, the\n\nlower your overall benefit.\nThe business world understands this \nmath. This is why it’s not uncommon to \nsee a company fire unproductive clients. \nIf 80 percent of their profits come from \n20 percent of their clients, then they \nmake more money by redirecting the \nenergy from low-revenue clients to \nbetter service the small number of \nlucrative contracts—each hour spent on \nthe latter returns more revenue than each \nhour spent on the former. The same holds \ntrue for your professional and personal \ngoals. By taking the time consumed by \nlow-impact activities— like finding old \nfriends on Facebook—and reinvesting in \nhigh-impact activities—like taking a\n\ngood friend out to lunch—you end up \nmore successful in your goal.

    "text": " a network tool using this logic, \ntherefore, is not to miss out on its \npotential small benefits, but is instead to \nget more out of the activities you already \nknow to yield large benefits.\nTo return to where we started, for \nMalcolm Gladwell, Michael Lewis, and \nGeorge Packer, Twitter doesn’t support \nthe 20 percent of activities that generate \nthe bulk of the success in their writing \ncareers. Even though in isolation this \nservice might return some minor \nbenefits, when their careers are viewed \nas a whole, they’re likely more \nsuccessful not using Twitter, and\n\nredirecting that time to more fruitful \nactivities, than if they added it into their \nschedule as one more thing to manage. \nYou should take this same care in \ndeciding which tools you allow to claim \nyour own limited time and attention.\nQuit Social Media\nWhen Ryan Nicodemus decided to \nsimplify his life, one of his first targets \nwas his possessions. At the time, Ryan \nlived alone in a spacious three-bedroom \ncondo. For years, driven by a \nconsumerist impulse, he had been trying \nhis best to fill this ample space. Now it\n\nwas time to reclaim his life from his \nstuff. The strategy he deployed was \nsimple to describe but radical in \nconcept. He spent an afternoon packing \neverything he owned into cardboard \nboxes as if he was about to move. In \norder to transform what he described as \na “difficult undertaking” into something \nless onerous, he called it a “packing \nparty,” explaining: “Everything’s more \nexciting when it’s a party, right?”\nOnce the packing was done, \nNicodemus then spent the next week \ngoing through his normal routine. If he \nneeded something that was packed, he \nwould unpack it and put it back where it \nused to go. At the end of the week, he\n\nnoticed that the vast majority of his stuff \nremained untouched in its boxes.\nSo he got rid of it.\nStuff accumulates in people’s lives, \nin part, because when faced with a \nspecific act of elimination it’s easy to \nworry, “What if I need this one day?,” \nand then use this worry as an excuse to \nkeep the item in question sitting around. \nNicodemus’s packing party provided \nhim with definitive evidence that most of \nhis stuff was not  something he needed, \nand it therefore supported his quest to \nsimplify.\nThe last strategy provided a systematic \nmethod to help you begin sorting through\n\nthe network tools that currently lay claim \nto your time and attention. This strategy \noffers you a different but complementary \napproach to these same issues, and it’s \ninspired by Ryan Nicodemus’s approach \nto getting rid of his useless stuff.\nIn more detail, this strategy asks that \nyou perform the equivalent of a packing \nparty on the social media services that \nyou currently use. Instead of “packing,” \nhowever, you’ll instead ban yourself \nfrom using them for thirty days.  All of \nthem: Facebook, Instagram, Google+, \nTwitter, Snapchat, Vine—or whatever \nother services have risen to popularity \nsince I first wrote these words. Don’t \nformally deactivate these services, and\n\n(this is important) don’t mention online \nthat you’ll be signing off: Just stop using \nthem, cold turkey. If someone reaches \nout to you by other means and asks why \nyour activity on a particular service has \nfallen off, you can explain, but don’t go \nout of your way to tell people.\nAfter thirty days of this self-imposed \nnetwork isolation, ask yourself the \nfollowing two questions about each of \nthe services you temporarily quit:\n1. Would the last thirty days have \nbeen notably better if I had been \nable to use this service?\n2. Did people care that I wasn’t \nusing this service?\n\nIf your answer is “no” to both \nquestions, quit the service permanently. \nIf your answer was a clear “yes,” then \nreturn to using the service. If your \nanswers are qualified or ambiguous, it’s \nup to you whether you return to the \nservice, though I would encourage you to \nlean toward quitting. (You can always \nrejoin later.)\nThis strategy picks specifically on \nsocial media because among the \ndifferent network tools that can claim \nyour time and attention, these services, if \nused without limit, can be particularly \ndevastating to your quest to work \ndeeper. They offer personalized \ninformation arriving on an unpredictable\n\nintermittent schedule—making them\nmassively addictive and therefore \ncapable of severely damaging your \nattempts to schedule and succeed with \nany act of concentration. Given these \ndangers, you might expect that more \nknowledge workers would avoid these \ntools altogether—especially those like \ncomputer programmers or writers",

Even though in isolation this \nservice might return some minor \nbenefits, when their careers are viewed \nas a whole, they’re likely more \nsuccessful not using Twitter, and\n\nredirecting that time to more fruitful \nactivities, than if they added it into their \nschedule as one more thing to manage. \nYou should take this same care in \ndeciding which tools you allow to claim \nyour own limited time and attention.\nQuit Social Media\nWhen Ryan Nicodemus decided to \nsimplify his life, one of his first targets \nwas his possessions. At the time, Ryan \nlived alone in a spacious three-bedroom \ncondo. For years, driven by a \nconsumerist impulse, he had been trying \nhis best to fill this ample space. Now it\n\nwas time to reclaim his life from his \nstuff. The strategy he deployed was \nsimple to describe but radical in \nconcept. He spent an afternoon packing \neverything he owned into cardboard \nboxes as if he was about to move. In \norder to transform what he described as \na “difficult undertaking” into something \nless onerous, he called it a “packing \nparty,” explaining: “Everything’s more \nexciting when it’s a party, right?”\nOnce the packing was done, \nNicodemus then spent the next week \ngoing through his normal routine. If he \nneeded something that was packed, he \nwould unpack it and put it back where it \nused to go. At the end of the week, he\n\nnoticed that the vast majority of his stuff \nremained untouched in its boxes.\nSo he got rid of it.\nStuff accumulates in people’s lives, \nin part, because when faced with a \nspecific act of elimination it’s easy to \nworry, “What if I need this one day?,” \nand then use this worry as an excuse to \nkeep the item in question sitting around. \nNicodemus’s packing party provided \nhim with definitive evidence that most of \nhis stuff was not  something he",

Now it\n\nwas time to reclaim his life from his \nstuff. The strategy he deployed was \nsimple to describe but radical in \nconcept. He spent an afternoon packing \neverything he owned into cardboard \nboxes as if he was about to move. In \norder to transform what he described as \na “difficult undertaking” into something \nless onerous, he called it a “packing \nparty,” explaining: “Everything’s more \nexciting when it’s a party, right?”\nOnce the packing was done, \nNicodemus then spent the next week \ngoing through his normal routine. If he \nneeded something that was packed, he \nwould unpack it and put it back where it \nused to go. At the end of the week, he\n\nnoticed that the vast majority of his stuff \nremained untouched in its boxes.\nSo he got rid of it.\nStuff accumulates in people’s lives, \nin part, because when faced with a \nspecific act of elimination it’s easy to \nworry, “What if",

This strategy \noffers you a different but complementary \napproach to these same issues, and it’s \ninspired by Ryan Nicodemus’s approach \nto getting rid of his useless stuff.\nIn more detail, this strategy asks that \nyou perform the equivalent of a packing \nparty on the social media services that \nyou currently use. Instead of “packing,” \nhowever, you’ll instead ban yourself \nfrom using them for thirty days.  All of \nthem: Facebook, Instagram, Google+, \nTwitter, Snapchat, Vine—or whatever \nother services have risen to popularity \nsince I first wrote these words. Don’t \nformally deactivate these services, and\n\n(this is important) don’t mention online \nthat you’ll be signing off: Just stop using \nthem, cold turkey. If someone reaches \nout to you by other means and asks why \nyour activity on a particular service has \nfallen off, you can explain, but don’t go \nout of your way to tell people.\nAfter thirty days of this self-imposed \nnetwork isolation, ask yourself the \nfollowing two questions about each of \nthe services you temporarily quit:\n1. Would the last thirty days have \nbeen notably better if I had been \nable to use this service?\n2. Did people care that I wasn’t \nusing this service?\n\nIf your answer is “no” to both \nquestions, quit the service permanently. \nIf your answer was a clear “yes,” then \nreturn to using the service. If your \nanswers are qualified or ambiguous, it’s \nup to you whether you return to the \nservice, though I would encourage you to \nlean toward quitting. (You can always \nrejoin later.)\nThis strategy picks specifically on \nsocial media because among the \ndifferent network tools that can claim \nyour time and attention, these services, if \nused without limit, can be particularly \ndevastating to your quest to work \ndeeper. They offer personalized \ninformation arriving on an unpredictable\n\nintermittent schedule—making them\nmassively addictive and therefore",

Given these \ndangers, you might expect that more \nknowledge workers would avoid these \ntools altogether—especially those like \ncomputer programmers or writers whose \nlivelihood explicitly depends on the \noutcome of deep work. But part of what \nmakes social media insidious is that the \ncompanies that profit from your attention \nhave succeeded with a masterful \nmarketing coup: convincing our culture \nthat if you don’t use their products you \nmight miss out.\n\nThis fear that you might miss out has \nobvious parallels to Nicodemus’s fear \nthat the voluminous stuff in his closets \nmight one day prove useful, which is \nwhy I’m suggesting a corrective strategy \nthat parallels his packing party. By \nspending a month without these services, \nyou can replace your fear that you might \nmiss out—on events, on conversations, \non shared cultural experience—with a \ndose of reality. For most people this \nreality will confirm something that \nseems obvious only once you’ve done \nthe hard work of freeing yourself from \nthe marketing messages surrounding \nthese tools: They’re not really all that \nimportant in your life.\n\nThe reason why I ask you to not \nannounce your thirty-day experiment is \nbecause for some people another part of \nthe delusion that binds them to social \nmedia is the idea that people want to  \nhear what you have to say , and that they \nmight be disappointed if you suddenly \nleave them bereft of your commentary. \nI’m being somewhat facetious here in my \nwording, but this underlying sentiment is \nnonetheless common and important to \ntackle. As of this writing, for example, \nthe average number of followers for a \nTwitter user is 208. When you know that \nmore than two hundred people \nvolunteered  to hear what you have to \nsay, it’s easy to begin to believe that\n\nyour activities on these services are \nimportant. Speaking from experience as \nsomeone who makes a living trying to \nsell my ideas to people: This is a \npowerfully addictive feeling!\nBut here’s the reality of audiences in \na social media era. Before these \nservices existed, building an audience of \nany size beyond your immediate friends \nand family required hard, competitive \nwork. In the early 2000s, for example, \nanyone could start a blog, but to gain \neven just a handful of unique visitors per \nmonth required that you actually put in \nthe work to deliver information that’s \nvaluable enough to capture someone’s \nattention. I know this difficulty well. My\n\nfirst blog was started in the fall of 2003. \nIt was called, cleverly enough, Inspiring  \nMoniker.  I used it to muse on my life as \na twenty-one-year-old college student. \nThere were, I’m embarrassed to admit, \nlong stretches where no one  read it (a \nterm I’m using literally). As I learned in \nthe decade that followed, a period in \nwhich I patiently and painstakingly built \nan audience for my current blog, Study  \nHacks,  from a handful of readers to \nhundreds of thousands per month, is that \nearning people’s attention online is hard, \nhard work.\nExcept now it’s not.\nPart of what fueled social media’s \nrapid assent, I contend, is its ability to\n\nshort-circuit this connection between the \nhard work of producing real value and \nthe positive reward of having people \npay attention to you. It has instead \nreplaced this timeless capitalist \nexchange with a shallow collectivist \nalternative: I'll pay attention to what  \nyou say if you pay attention to what I  \nsay—regardless o f its value.  A blog or \nmagazine or television program that \ncontained the content that typically \npopulates a Facebook wall or Twitter \nfeed, for example, would attract, on \naverage, no audience. But when \ncaptured within the social conventions \nof these services, that same content will \nattract attention in the form of likes and\n\ncomments. The implicit agreement \nmotivating this behavior is that in return \nfor receiving (for the most part, \nundeserved) attention from your friends \nand followers, you’ll return the favor by \nlavishing (similarly undeserved) \nattention on them. You “ like ”  my status  \nupdate and I ’ ll “ like”  yours.  This \nagreement gives everyone a simulacrum \nof importance without requiring much \neffort in return.\nBy dropping off these services \nwithout notice you can test the reality of \nyour status as a content producer. For \nmost people and most services, the news \nmight be sobering—no one outside your \nclosest friends and family will likely\n\neven notice you’ve signed off. I \nrecognize that I come across as",

Given these \ndangers, you might expect that more \nknowledge workers would avoid these \ntools altogether—especially those like \ncomputer programmers or writers whose \nlivelihood explicitly depends on the \noutcome of deep work. But part of what \nmakes social media insidious is that the \ncompanies that profit from your attention \nhave succeeded with a masterful \nmarketing coup: convincing our culture \nthat if you don’t use their products you \nmight miss out.\n\nThis fear that you might miss out has \nobvious parallels to Nicodemus’s fear \nthat the voluminous stuff in his closets \nmight one day prove useful, which is \nwhy I’m suggesting a corrective strategy \nthat parallels his packing party. By \nspending a month without these services, \nyou can replace your fear that you might \nmiss out—on events, on conversations, \non shared cultural experience—with a \ndose of reality. For most people this \nreality will confirm something that \nseems obvious only once you’ve done \nthe hard work of freeing yourself from \nthe marketing messages surrounding \nthese tools: They’re not really all that \nimportant in your life.\n\nThe reason why I ask you to not \nannounce your thirty-day experiment is \nbecause for some people another part of \nthe delusion that binds them to social \nmedia is the idea that people want to  \nhear what you have to say , and that they \nmight be disappointed if you suddenly \nleave them bereft of your commentary. \nI’m being somewhat facetious here in my \nwording, but this underlying sentiment is \nnonetheless common and important to \ntackle. As of this writing, for example, \nthe average number of followers for a \nTwitter user is 208. When you know that \nmore than two hundred people \nvolunteered  to hear what you have to \nsay, it’s easy to begin to believe that\n\nyour activities on these services are \nimportant. Speaking from experience as \nsomeone who makes a living trying to \nsell my ideas to people: This is a \npowerfully addictive feeling!\nBut here’s the reality of audiences in \na social media era. Before these \nservices existed, building an audience of \nany size beyond your immediate friends \nand family required hard, competitive \nwork. In the early 2000s, for example, \nanyone could start a blog, but to gain \neven just",

As of this writing, for example, \nthe average number of followers for a \nTwitter user is 208. When you know that \nmore than two hundred people \nvolunteered  to hear what you have to \nsay, it’s easy to begin to believe that\n\nyour activities on these services are \nimportant. Speaking from experience as \nsomeone who makes a living trying to \nsell my ideas to people: This is a \npowerfully addictive feeling!\nBut here’s the reality of audiences in \na social media era.

    "text": " \nservices existed, building an audience of \nany size beyond your immediate friends \nand family required hard, competitive \nwork. In the early 2000s, for example, \nanyone could start a blog, but to gain \neven just a handful of unique visitors per \nmonth required that you actually put in \nthe work to deliver information that’s \nvaluable enough to capture someone’s \nattention. I know this difficulty well. My\n\nfirst blog was started in the fall of 2003. \nIt was called, cleverly enough, Inspiring  \nMoniker.  I used it to muse on my life as \na twenty-one-year-old college student. \nThere were, I’m embarrassed to admit, \nlong stretches where no one  read it (a \nterm I’m using literally). As I learned in \nthe decade that followed, a period in \nwhich I patiently and painstakingly built \nan audience for my current blog, Study  \nHacks,  from a handful of readers to \nhundreds of thousands per month, is that \nearning people’s attention online is hard, \nhard work.\nExcept now it’s not.\nPart of what fueled social media’s \nrapid assent, I contend, is its ability to\n\nshort-circuit this connection between the \nhard work of producing real value and \nthe positive reward of having people \npay attention to you. It has instead \nreplaced this timeless capitalist \nexchange with a shallow collectivist \nalternative: I'll pay attention to what  \nyou say if you pay attention to what I  \nsay—regardless o f its value.  A blog or \nmagazine or television program that \ncontained the content that typically \npopulates a Facebook wall or Twitter \nfeed, for example, would attract, on \naverage, no audience. But when \ncaptured within the social conventions \nof these services, that same content will \nattract attention in the form of likes and\n\ncomments. The implicit agreement \nmotivating this behavior is that in return \nfor receiving (for the most part, \nundeserved) attention from your friends \nand followers, you’ll return the favor by \nlavishing (similarly undeserved) \nattention on them. You “ like ”  my status  \nupdate and I ’ ll “ like”  yours.  This \nagreement gives everyone a simulacrum \nof importance without requiring much \neffort in return.\nBy dropping off these services \nwithout notice you can test the reality of \nyour",

It has instead \nreplaced this timeless capitalist \nexchange with a shallow collectivist \nalternative: I'll pay attention to what  \nyou say if you pay attention to what I  \nsay—regardless o f its value.  A blog or \nmagazine or television program that \ncontained the content that typically \npopulates a Facebook wall or Twitter \nfeed, for example, would attract, on \naverage, no audience. But when \ncaptured within the social conventions \nof these services, that same content will \nattract attention in the form of likes and\n\ncomments. The implicit agreement \nmotivating this behavior is that in return \nfor receiving (for the most part, \nundeserved) attention from your friends \nand followers, you’ll return the favor by \nlavishing (similarly undeserved) \nattention on them.

For \nmost people and most services, the news \nmight be sobering—no one outside your \nclosest friends and family will likely\n\neven notice you’ve signed off. I \nrecognize that I come across as \ncurmudgeonly when talking about this \nissue—is there any other way to tackle \nit?—but it’s important to discuss \nbecause this quest for self-importance \nplays an important role in convincing \npeople to continue to thoughtlessly \nfragment their time and attention.\nFor some people, of course, this \nthirty-day experiment will be difficult \nand generate lots of issues. If you’re a \ncollege student or online personality, for \nexample, the abstention will complicate \nyour life and will be noted. But for most, \nI suspect, the net result of this \nexperiment, if not a massive overhaul in\n\nyour Internet habits, will be a more \ngrounded view of the role social media \nplays in your daily existence. These \nservices aren’t necessarily, as \nadvertised, the lifeblood of our modern \nconnected world. They’re just products, \ndeveloped by private companies, funded \nlavishly, marketed carefully, and \ndesigned ultimately to capture then sell \nyour personal information and attention \nto advertisers. They can be fun, but in \nthe scheme of your life and what you \nwant to accomplish, they’re a \nlightweight whimsy, one unimportant \ndistraction among many threatening to \nderail you from something deeper. Or \nmaybe social media tools are at the core\n\nof your existence. You won’t know \neither way until you sample life without \nthem.\nDon’t Use the Internet to \nEntertain Yourself\nArnold Bennett was an English writer \nborn near the turn of the twentieth \ncentury—a tumultuous time for his home \ncountry’s economy. The industrial \nrevolution, which had been roaring for \ndecades by this point, had wrenched \nenough surplus capital from the empire’s \nresources to generate a new class: the \nwhite-collar worker. It was now\n\npossible to have a job in which you \nspent a set number of hours a week in an \noffice, and in exchange received a \nsteady salary sufficient to support a \nhousehold. Such a lifestyle is blandly \nfamiliar in our current age, but to \nBennett and his contemporaries it was \nnovel and in many ways distressing. \nChief among Bennett’s concerns was that \nmembers of this new class were missing \nout on the opportunities it presented to \nlive a full life.\n“Take the case of a Londoner who \nworks in an office, whose office hours \nare from ten to six, and who spends fifty \nminutes morning and night in travelling \nbetween his house door and his office\n\ndoor,” Bennett writes in his 1910 self­\nhelp classic, How to Live on 24 Hours a  \nDay.  This hypothetical London \nsalaryman, he notes, has a little more \nthan sixteen hours left in the day beyond \nthese work-related hours. To Bennett, \nthis is a lot of time, but most people in \nthis situation tragically don’t realize its \npotential. The “great and profound \nmistake which my typical man makes in \nregard to his day,” he elaborates, is that \neven though he doesn’t particularly \nenjoy his work (seeing it as something to \n“get through”), “he persists in looking \nupon those hours from ten to six as ‘the \nday,’  to which the ten hours preceding \nthem and the six hours following them\n\nare nothing but a prologue and \nepilogue.” This is an attitude that \nBennett condemns as “utterly illogical \nand unhealthy.”\nWhat’s the alternative to this state of \naffairs? Bennett suggests that his typical \nman see his sixteen free hours as a “day \nwithin a day,” explaining, “during those \nsixteen hours he is f ree; he is not a \nwage-earner; he is not preoccupied with \nmonetary cares; he is just as good as a \nman with a private income.” \nAccordingly, the typical man should \ninstead use this time as an aristocrat \nwould: to perform rigorous self-\nimprovement—a task that, according to \nBennett, involves, primarily, reading\n\ngreat literature and poetry.\nBennett wrote about these issues \nmore than a century ago. You might \nexpect that in the intervening decades, a \nperiod in which this middle class \nexploded in size worldwide, our \nthinking about leisure time would have \nevolved. But it has not. If anything, with \nthe rise of the Internet and the low-brow \nattention economy it supports, the \naverage forty-hour-a-week employee— \nespecially those in my tech-savvy \nMillennial generation—has seen the \nquality of his or",

For \nmost people and most services, the news \nmight be sobering—no one outside your \nclosest friends and family will likely\n\neven notice you’ve signed off. I \nrecognize that I come across as \ncurmudgeonly when talking about this \nissue—is there any other way to tackle \nit?—but it’s important to discuss \nbecause this quest for self-importance \nplays an important role in convincing \npeople to continue to thoughtlessly \nfragment their time and attention.\nFor some people, of course, this \nthirty-day experiment will be difficult \nand generate lots of issues. If you’re a \ncollege student or online personality, for \nexample, the abstention will complicate \nyour life and will be noted. But for most, \nI suspect, the net result of this \nexperiment, if not a massive overhaul in\n\nyour Internet habits, will be a more \ngrounded view of the role social media \nplays in your daily existence. These \nservices aren’t necessarily, as \nadvertised, the lifeblood of our modern \nconnected world. They’re just products, \ndeveloped by private companies, funded \nlavishly, marketed carefully, and \ndesigned ultimately to capture then sell \nyour personal information and attention \nto advertisers. They can be fun, but in \nthe scheme of your life and what you \nwant to accomplish, they’re a \nlightweight whimsy, one unimportant \ndistraction among many threatening to \nderail you from something deeper. Or \nmaybe social media tools are at the core\n\nof your existence. You won’t know \neither way until you sample life without \nthem.\nDon’t Use the Internet to \nEntertain Yourself\nArnold Bennett was an English writer \nborn near the turn of the twentieth \ncentury—a tumultuous time for his home \ncountry’s economy. The industrial \nrevolution, which had been roaring for \ndecades by this point, had wrenched \nenough surplus capital from the empire’s \nresources to generate a new class: the \nwhite-collar worker. It was now\n\npossible to have a job in which you \nspent a set number of hours a week in an \noffice, and in exchange received a \nsteady salary sufficient to support a \nhousehold. Such a lifestyle is blandly \nfamiliar in our current age, but to \nBennett and his contemporaries it was \nnovel and in many ways distressing. \nChief among Bennett’s",

    "text": " salary sufficient to support a \nhousehold. Such a lifestyle is blandly \nfamiliar in our current age, but to \nBennett and his contemporaries it was \nnovel and in many ways distressing. \nChief among Bennett’s concerns was that \nmembers of this new class were missing \nout on the opportunities it presented to \nlive a full life.\n“Take the case of a Londoner who \nworks in an office, whose office hours \nare from ten to six, and who spends fifty \nminutes morning and night in travelling \nbetween his house door and his office\n\ndoor,” Bennett writes in his 1910 self­\nhelp classic, How to Live on 24 Hours a  \nDay.  This hypothetical London \nsalaryman, he notes, has a little more \nthan sixteen hours left in the day beyond \nthese work-related hours. To Bennett, \nthis is a lot of time, but most people in \nthis situation tragically don’t realize its \npotential. The “great and profound \nmistake which my typical man makes in \nregard to his day,” he elaborates, is that \neven though he doesn’t particularly \nenjoy his work (seeing it as something to \n“get through”), “he persists in looking \nupon those hours from ten to six as ‘the \nday,’  to which the ten hours preceding \nthem and the six hours following them\n\nare nothing but a prologue and \nepilogue.” This is an attitude that \nBennett condemns as “utterly illogical \nand unhealthy.”\nWhat’s the alternative to this state of \naffairs? Bennett suggests that his typical \nman see his sixteen free hours as a “day \nwithin a day,” explaining, “during those \nsixteen hours he is f ree; he is not a \nwage-earner; he is not preoccupied with \nmonetary cares; he is just as good as a \nman with a private income.” \nAccordingly, the typical man should \ninstead use this time as an aristocrat \nwould: to perform rigorous self-\nimprovement—a task that, according to \nBennett, involves, primarily, reading\n\ngreat literature and poetry.\nBennett wrote about these issues \nmore than a century ago. You might \nexpect that in the intervening decades, a \nperiod in which this middle class \nexploded in size worldwide, our \nthinking about leisure time would have \nevolved. But it has not.

    "text": ", with \nthe rise of the Internet and the low-brow \nattention economy it supports, the \naverage forty-hour-a-week employee— \nespecially those in my tech-savvy \nMillennial generation—has seen the \nquality of his or her leisure time remain \ndegraded, consisting primarily of a blur \nof distracted clicks on least-common- \ndenominator digital entertainment. If\n\nBennett were brought back to life today, \nhe’d likely fall into despair at the lack of \nprogress in this area of human \ndevelopment.\nTo be clear, I’m indifferent to the \nmoral underpinnings behind Bennett’s \nsuggestions. His vision of elevating the \nsouls and minds of the middle class by \nreading poetry and great books feels \nsomewhat antiquated and classist. But \nthe logical foundation of his proposal, \nthat you both should  and can make \ndeliberate use of your time outside \nwork, remains relevant today— \nespecially with respect to the goal of \nthis rule, which is to reduce the impact \nof network tools on your ability to\n\nperform deep work.\nIn more detail, in the strategies \ndiscussed so far in this rule, we haven’t \nspent much time yet on a class of \nnetwork tools that are particularly \nrelevant to the fight for depth: \nentertainment-focused websites designed \nto capture and hold your attention for as \nlong as possible. At the time of this \nwriting, the most popular examples of \nsuch sites include the Huffington Post, \nBuzzFeed, Business Insider, and Reddit. \nThis list will undoubtedly continue to \nevolve, but what this general category of \nsites shares is the use o f carefully \ncrafted titles and easily digestible \ncontent, often honed by algorithms to be\n\nmaximally attention catching.\nOnce you’ve landed on one article in \none of these sites, links on the side or \nbottom of the page beckon you to click \non another, then another. Every available \ntrick of human psychology, from listing \ntitles as “popular” or “trending,” to the \nuse of arresting photos, is used to keep \nyou engaged. At this particular moment, \nfor example, some of the most popular \narticles on BuzzFeed include, “17 Words \nThat Mean Something Totally Different \nWhen Spelled Backward” and “33 Dogs \nWinning at Everything.”\nThese sites are especially harmful \nafter the workday is over, where the \nfreedom in your schedule enables them\n\nto become central to your leisure time. If \nyou’re waiting in line, or waiting for the \nplot to pick up in a TV show, or waiting \nto finish eating a meal, they provide a \ncognitive crutch to ensure you eliminate \nany chance of boredom As I argued in \nRule #2, however, such behavior is \ndangerous, as it weakens your mind’s \ngeneral ability to resist distraction, \nmaking deep work difficult later when \nyou really want to concentrate. To make \nmatters worse, these network tools are \nnot something you join and therefore \nthey’re not something you can remove \nfrom your life by quitting (rendering the \nprevious two strategies irrelevant). \nThey’re always available, just a quick\n\nclick away.\nFortunately, Arnold Bennett \nidentified the solution to this problem a \nhundred years earlier: Put more thought  \ninto your leisure time.  In other words, \nthis strategy suggests that when it comes \nto your relaxation, don’t default to \nwhatever catches your attention at the \nmoment, but instead dedicate some \nadvance thinking to the question of how \nyou want to spend your “day within a \nday.” Addictive websites of the type \nmentioned previously thrive in a \nvacuum: If you haven’t given yourself \nsomething to do in a given moment, \nthey’ll always beckon as an appealing \noption. If you instead fill this free time\n\nwith something of more quality, their \ngrip on your attention will loosen.\nIt’s crucial, therefore, that you figure \nout in advance what you’re going to do \nwith your evenings and weekends before \nthey begin. Structured hobbies provide \ngood fodder for these hours, as they \ngenerate specific actions with specific \ngoals to fill your time. A set program of \nreading, a la Bennett, where you spend \nregular time each night making progress \non a series of deliberately chosen books, \nis also a good option, as is, of course, \nexercise or the enjoyment of good (in­\nperson) company.\nIn my own life, for example, I \nmanage to read a surprising number of\n\nbooks in a typical year, given the \ndemands on my time as a professor, \nwriter, and father (on average, I’m \ntypically reading three to five books at a \ntime). This is possible because one of \nmy favorite preplanned leisure activities \nafter my kids’  bedtime is to read",

If\n\nBennett were brought back to life today, \nhe’d likely fall into despair at the lack of \nprogress in this area of human \ndevelopment.\nTo be clear, I’m indifferent to the \nmoral underpinnings behind Bennett’s \nsuggestions. His vision of elevating the \nsouls and minds of the middle class by \nreading poetry and great books feels \nsomewhat antiquated and classist. But \nthe logical foundation of his proposal, \nthat you both should  and can make \ndeliberate use of your time outside \nwork, remains relevant today— \nespecially with respect to the goal of \nthis rule, which is to reduce the impact \nof network tools on your ability to\n\nperform deep work.\nIn more detail, in the strategies \ndiscussed so far in this rule, we haven’t \nspent much time yet on a class of \nnetwork tools that are particularly \nrelevant to the fight for depth: \nentertainment-focused websites designed \nto capture and hold your attention for as \nlong as possible. At the time of this \nwriting, the most popular examples of \nsuch sites include the Huffington Post, \nBuzzFeed, Business Insider, and Reddit. \nThis list will undoubtedly continue to \nevolve, but what this general category of \nsites shares is the use o f carefully \ncrafted titles and easily digestible \ncontent, often honed by algorithms to be\n\nmaximally attention catching.\nOnce you’ve landed on one article in \none of these sites, links on the side or \nbottom of the page beckon you to click \non another, then another. Every available \ntrick of human psychology, from listing \ntitles as “popular” or “trending,” to the \nuse of arresting photos, is used to keep \nyou engaged. At this particular moment, \nfor example, some of the most popular \narticles on BuzzFeed include, “17 Words \nThat Mean Something Totally Different \nWhen Spelled Backward” and “33 Dogs \nWinning at Everything.”\nThese sites are especially harmful \nafter the workday is over, where the \nfreedom",

If\n\nBennett were brought back to life today, \nhe’d likely fall into despair at the lack of \nprogress in this area of human \ndevelopment.\nTo be clear, I’m indifferent to the \nmoral underpinnings behind Bennett’s \nsuggestions. His vision of elevating the \nsouls and minds of the middle class by \nreading poetry and great books feels \nsomewhat antiquated and classist. But \nthe logical foundation of his proposal, \nthat you both should  and can make \ndeliberate use of your time outside \nwork, remains relevant today— \nespecially with respect to the goal of \nthis rule, which is to reduce the impact \nof network tools on your ability to\n\nperform deep work.\nIn more detail, in the strategies \ndiscussed so far in this rule, we haven’t \nspent much time yet on",

If \nyou’re waiting in line, or waiting for the \nplot to pick up in a TV show, or waiting \nto finish eating a meal, they provide a \ncognitive crutch to ensure you eliminate \nany chance of boredom As I argued in \nRule #2, however, such behavior is \ndangerous, as it weakens your mind’s \ngeneral ability to resist distraction, \nmaking deep work difficult later when \nyou really want to concentrate. To make \nmatters worse, these network tools are \nnot something you join and therefore \nthey’re not something you can remove \nfrom your life by quitting (rendering the \nprevious two strategies irrelevant). \nThey’re always available, just a quick\n\nclick away.\nFortunately, Arnold Bennett \nidentified the solution to this problem a \nhundred years earlier: Put more thought  \ninto your leisure time.  In other words, \nthis strategy suggests that when it comes \nto your relaxation, don’t default to \nwhatever catches your attention at the \nmoment, but instead dedicate some \nadvance thinking to the question of how \nyou want to spend your “day within a \nday.” Addictive websites of the type \nmentioned previously thrive in a \nvacuum: If you haven’t given yourself \nsomething to do in a given moment, \nthey’ll always beckon as an appealing \noption. If you instead fill this free time\n\nwith something of more quality, their \ngrip on your attention will loosen.\nIt’s crucial, therefore, that you figure \nout in advance what you’re going to do \nwith your evenings and weekends before \nthey begin. Structured hobbies provide \ngood fodder for these hours, as they \ngenerate specific actions with specific \ngoals to fill your time. A set program of \nreading, a la Bennett, where you spend \nregular time each night making progress \non a series of deliberately chosen books, \nis also a good option, as is, of course, \nexercise or the enjoyment of good (in­\nperson) company.\nIn my own life, for example, I \nmanage to read a surprising number of\n\nbooks in a typical year, given the \ndemands on my time as",

    "text": " a professor, \nwriter, and father (on average, I’m \ntypically reading three to five books at a \ntime). This is possible because one of \nmy favorite preplanned leisure activities \nafter my kids’  bedtime is to read an \ninteresting book. As a result, my \nsmartphone and computer, and the \ndistractions they can offer, typically \nremain neglected between the end of the \nworkday and the next morning.\nAt this point you might worry that \nadding such structure to your relaxation \nwill defeat the purpose of relaxing, \nwhich many believe requires complete \nfreedom from plans or obligations.\n\nWon’t a structured evening leave you \nexhausted—not refreshed—the next day \nat work? Bennett, to his credit, \nanticipated this complaint. As he argues, \nsuch worries misunderstand what \nenergizes the human spirit:\nWhat? You say that fu ll energy  \ngiven to those sixteen hours will  \nlessen the value o f the business  \neight? Not so. On the contrary, it  \nwill assuredly increase the value  \no f the business eight. One o f the  \nchief things which my typical  \nman has to learn is that the  \nmental faculties are capable o f a  \ncontinuous hard activity; they do\n\nnot tire like an arm or a leg. All  \nthey want is change—not rest,  \nexcept in sleep.\nIn my experience, this analysis is \nspot-on. If you give your mind something \nmeaningful to do throughout all your \nwaking hours, you’ll end the day more \nfulfilled, and begin the next one more \nrelaxed, than if you instead allow your \nmind to bathe for hours in semiconscious \nand unstructured Web surfing.\nTo summarize, if you want to \neliminate the addictive pull of \nentertainment sites on your time and \nattention, give your brain a quality \nalternative. Not only will this preserve\n\nyour ability to resist distraction and \nconcentrate, but you might even fulfill \nArnold Bennett’s ambitious goal of \nexperiencing, perhaps for the first time, \nwhat it means to live, and not just exist.",

    "text": " a professor, \nwriter, and father (on average, I’m \ntypically reading three to five books at a \ntime). This is possible because one of \nmy favorite preplanned leisure activities \nafter my kids’  bedtime is to read an \ninteresting book. As a result, my \nsmartphone and computer, and the \ndistractions they can offer, typically \nremain neglected between the end of the \nworkday and the next morning.\nAt this point you might worry that \nadding such structure to your relaxation \nwill defeat the purpose of relaxing, \nwhich many believe requires complete \nfreedom from plans or obligations.\n\nWon’t a structured evening leave you \nexhausted—not refreshed—the next day \nat work? Bennett, to his credit, \nanticipated this complaint. As he argues, \nsuch worries misunderstand what \nenergizes the human spirit:\nWhat? You say that fu ll energy  \ngiven to those sixteen hours will  \nlessen the value o f the business  \neight? Not so. On the contrary, it  \nwill assuredly increase the value  \no f the business eight. One o f the  \nchief things which my typical  \nman has to learn is that the  \nmental faculties are capable o f a  \ncontinuous hard activity; they do\n\nnot tire like an arm or a leg. All  \nthey want is change—not rest,  \nexcept in sleep.\nIn my experience, this analysis is \nspot-on. If you give your mind something \nmeaningful to do throughout all your \nwaking hours, you’ll end the day more \nfulfilled, and begin the next one more \nrelaxed, than if you instead allow your \nmind to bathe for hours in semiconscious \nand unstructured Web surfing.\nTo summarize, if you want to \neliminate the addictive pull of \nentertainment sites on your time and \nattention, give your brain a quality \nalternative. Not only will this preserve\n\nyour ability to resist distraction and \nconcentrate, but you might even fulfill \nArnold Bennett’s ambitious goal of \nexperiencing, perhaps for the first time, \nwhat it means to live, and not just exist.",

    "text": " a professor, \nwriter, and father (on average, I’m \ntypically reading three to five books at a \ntime). This is possible because one of \nmy favorite preplanned leisure activities \nafter my kids’  bedtime is to read an \ninteresting book. As a result, my \nsmartphone and computer, and the \ndistractions they can offer, typically \nremain neglected between the end of the \nworkday and the next morning.\nAt this point you might worry that \nadding such structure to your relaxation \nwill defeat the purpose of relaxing, \nwhich many believe requires complete \nfreedom from plans or obligations.\n\nWon’t a structured evening leave you \nexhausted—not refreshed—the next day \nat work? Bennett, to his credit, \nanticipated this complaint. As he argues, \nsuch worries misunderstand what \nenergizes the human spirit:\nWhat? You say that fu ll energy  \ngiven to those sixteen hours will  \nlessen the value o f the business  \neight? Not so. On the contrary, it  \nwill assuredly increase the value  \no f the business eight. One o f the  \nchief things which my typical  \nman has to learn is that the  \nmental faculties are capable o f a  \ncontinuous hard activity",

All  \nthey want is change—not rest,  \nexcept in sleep.\nIn my experience, this analysis is \nspot-on. If you give your mind something \nmeaningful to do throughout all your \nwaking hours, you’ll end the day more \nfulfilled, and begin the next one more \nrelaxed, than if you instead allow your \nmind to bathe for hours in semiconscious \nand unstructured Web surfing.\nTo summarize, if you want to \neliminate the addictive pull of \nentertainment sites on your time and \nattention, give your brain a quality \nalternative. Not only will this preserve\n\nyour ability to resist distraction and \nconcentrate, but you might even fulfill \nArnold Bennett’s ambitious goal of \nexperiencing, perhaps for the first time, \nwhat it means to live, and not just exist.",
