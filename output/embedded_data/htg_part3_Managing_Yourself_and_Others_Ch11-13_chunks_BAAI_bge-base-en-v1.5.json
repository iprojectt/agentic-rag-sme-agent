Giving each per­\nson the attention he wants takes time. And you can't satisfy \nall of the people all of the time. If you've decided it's a C to \nattend all the parents' meetings at your daughter's school, \nyou can expect her to be disappointed when you don't go. If \nyou've decided to give up your weekly tennis game because \nit's no longer fun, you can expect your partner to be dis­\ngruntled. If you've decided it's no longer worth your time to \nkeep training an employee who doesn't seem to be catching \non, you can expect him to be upset when you get rid of him. \nIf you postpone delivery of Jones' order to satisfy an emer­\ngency request from the Smith Co., you can expect Jones to \nbe annoyed or apoplectic, and this time you might even lose \nJones' business for good. \nIt's a real dilemma whether or not to put aside an A of \nyour own when asked to do something else. It might take a \nlot less time to do what is a C for you but an A for someone \nimportant to you—perhaps your spouse or your boss—than it \nwould take to explain why you don't consider the demand \nvery urgent On the other hand, you don't always want to do \nother people's A's at the expense of your own. \nYou can never do everything that everyone wants—there \njust isn't time. You must set priorities based on the impor­\ntance to you of the person doing the asking and the conse­\nquences if you don't do what's being asked. If the person \ndoing the asking, or what is being asked, is unimportant to \nyou, you may choose to defer the request (at least the first \ntime around). Some of these requests for action that come \nyour way are soon forgotten or downgraded to C's by the \nasker and don't have to be done at all. \n84 \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LD7B 85 \nLearn to Say \"No\" \nSometimes the best solution is to say \"No\" at the outset \nThis one word, used promptly, properly and with courtesy, \ncan save you a great deal of time. It's important not to let \nother people fritter away your time, but when you say \"No\" \nyou have to make it stick while not seeming ruthless or un­\nfair. And everybody knows how hard that is. \nYou can tell the other person that you appreciate how im­\nportant the activity is to him but you are too busy to help \nhim out now. If it makes you feel better, apologize and men­\ntion one or two of the A's that pre-empt your attention. Per­\nhaps he will see it from your point of view. He might even \napologize to you for intruding on your time. \nSome people have a great deal of trouble saying \"No.\" A \nclient of mine, Ms. Filmore, found that she was spending \nmost of her time on other people's priorities. When we looked \nat the situation together, it was clear to us both that she was \nsaying \"Yes\" because she was afraid to stand up for her own \npriorities. Perhaps her trouble stemmed from childhood. Her \ndomineering parents had always limited her actions and told \nher not only what to do, but when to do it \nAs we talked she began to see that her reluctance to say \n\"No\" wasn't really fair to others. She realized that she would \nsay \"Yes\" when there was little hope of her actually doing \nwhat was asked. In one instance, she disappointed a very im­\nportant person who would have made other arrangements if \nhe'd suspected that a \"Yes\" from Ms. Fillmore meant \n\"Maybe.\" The realization that saying \"Yes,\" and not deliver­\ning, was worse for all concerned than saying \"No,\" helped \nher solve her problem. \nThere are other ways besides Ms. Fillmore's to avoid \nsaying \"No.\" The administrative assistant who vows to fulfill \na request \"Right away\" (whether he intends to or not), the \ncolleague who offers sympathy when action is needed, and \nthe mailroom clerk who claims never to have received your \nrequest in the first place, are all wasting your time and theirs \nbecause they have not learned to say \"No.\" To do this is sim-\n86 ALAN LAKE IN \nply poor ethics, poor business, poor personal relations, and it \ncan make life harder for everyone in the future. \nCompromises that Work \nWhat can you do if the person doing the asking is your",

Giving each per­\nson the attention he wants takes time. And you can't satisfy \nall of the people all of the time. If you've decided it's a C to \nattend all the parents' meetings at your daughter's school, \nyou can expect her to be disappointed when you don't go. If \nyou've decided to give up your weekly tennis game because \nit's no longer fun, you can expect your partner to be dis­\ngruntled. If you've decided it's no longer worth your time to \nkeep training an employee who doesn't seem to be catching \non, you can expect him to be upset when you get rid of him. \nIf you postpone delivery of Jones' order to satisfy an emer­\ngency request from the Smith Co., you can expect Jones to \nbe annoyed or apoplectic, and this time you might even lose \nJones' business for good. \nIt's a real dilemma whether or not to put aside an A of \nyour own when asked to do something else. It might take a \nlot less time to do what is a C for you but an A for someone \nimportant to you—perhaps your spouse or your boss—than it \nwould take to explain why you don't consider the demand \nvery urgent On the other hand, you don't always want to do \nother people's A's at the expense of your own. \nYou can never do everything that everyone wants—there \njust isn't time. You must set priorities based on the impor­\ntance to you of the person doing the asking and the conse­\nquences if you don't do what's being asked. If the person \ndoing the asking, or what is being asked, is unimportant to \nyou, you may choose to defer the request (at least the first \ntime around). Some of these requests for action that come \nyour way are soon forgotten or downgraded to C's by the \nasker and don't have to be done at all. \n84 \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LD7B 85 \nLearn to Say \"No\" \nSometimes the best solution is to say \"No\" at the outset \nThis one word, used promptly, properly and with courtesy, \ncan save you a great deal of time.

Giving each per­\nson the attention he wants takes time. And you can't satisfy \nall of the people all of the time. If you've decided it's a C to \nattend all the parents' meetings at your daughter's school, \nyou can expect her to be disappointed when you don't go. If \nyou've decided to give up your weekly tennis game because \nit's no longer fun, you can expect your partner to be dis­\ngruntled. If you've decided it's no longer worth your time to \nkeep training an employee who doesn't seem to be catching \non, you can expect him to be upset when you get rid of him. \nIf you postpone delivery of Jones' order to satisfy an emer­\ngency request from the Smith Co., you can expect Jones to \nbe annoyed or apoplectic, and this time you might even lose \nJones' business for good. \nIt's a real dilemma whether or not to put aside an A of \nyour own when asked to do something else. It might take a \nlot less time",

It might take a \nlot less time to do what is a C for you but an A for someone \nimportant to you—perhaps your spouse or your boss—than it \nwould take to explain why you don't consider the demand \nvery urgent On the other hand, you don't always want to do \nother people's A's at the expense of your own. \nYou can never do everything that everyone wants—there \njust isn't time. You must set priorities based on the impor­\ntance to you of the person doing the asking and the conse­\nquences if you don't do what's being asked. If the person \ndoing the asking, or what is being asked, is unimportant to \nyou, you may choose to defer the request (at least the first \ntime around). Some of these requests for action that come \nyour way are soon forgotten or downgraded to C's by the \nasker and don't have to be done at all. \n84 \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LD",

It's important not to let \nother people fritter away your time, but when you say \"No\" \nyou have to make it stick while not seeming ruthless or un­\nfair. And everybody knows how hard that is. \nYou can tell the other person that you appreciate how im­\nportant the activity is to him but you are too busy to help \nhim out now. If it makes you feel better, apologize and men­\ntion one or two of the A's that pre-empt your attention. Per­\nhaps he will see it from your point of view. He might even \napologize to you for intruding on your time. \nSome people have a great deal of trouble saying \"No.\" A \nclient of mine, Ms. Filmore, found that she was spending \nmost of her time on other people's priorities. When we looked \nat the situation together, it was clear to us both that she was \nsaying \"Yes\" because she was afraid to stand up for her own \npriorities. Perhaps her trouble stemmed from childhood. Her \ndomineering parents had always limited her actions and told \nher not only what to do, but when to do it \nAs we talked she began to see that her reluctance to say \n\"No\" wasn't really fair to others. She realized that she would \nsay \"Yes\" when there was little hope of her actually doing \nwhat was asked. In one instance, she disappointed a very im­\nportant person who would have made other arrangements if \nhe'd suspected that a \"Yes\" from Ms. Fillmore meant \n\"Maybe.\" The realization that saying \"Yes,\" and not deliver­\ning, was worse for all concerned than saying \"No,\" helped \nher solve her problem. \nThere are other ways besides Ms. Fillmore's to avoid \nsaying \"No.\" The administrative assistant who vows to fulfill \na request \"Right away\" (whether he intends to or not), the \ncolleague who offers sympathy when action is needed, and \nthe mailroom clerk who claims never to have received your \nrequest in the first place, are all wasting your time and theirs \nbecause they have not learned to say \"No.\" To do this is sim-\n",

    "text": "86 ALAN LAKE IN \nply poor ethics, poor business, poor personal relations, and it \ncan make life harder for everyone in the future. \nCompromises that Work \nWhat can you do if the person doing the asking is your \nspouse, your boss, your child, your parent, or your best \nfriend and you don't feel you can out-and-out say \"No\"? You \ncan often satisfy other people and still not completely sacri­\nfice your own priorities if you look for compromises. \nWhen another person asks you to do something for him \nright away, he may well be more interested in speed than \nperfection. If you feel his demands on your time are reason­\nable, look for short-cuts. If your boss unexpectedly asks for a \nquick report on the month's sales, chances are hell settle for \na brief survey provided he gets it right away. If your daugh­\nter asks you on short notice to make her a new dress for a \nparty, propose a quickly-made skirt instead. \nOther people may habitually turn to you for particular \ntasks because you have, in effect, trained them to do so. \nMaybe it used to be your A to pack the family's lunches, but \nnow that the kids are older, you've found an interesting sell­\ning job. You'll have to wean them away from having mother \ndo it, perhaps by rotating the responsibility for preparing \nlunch. In business, you could encourage a demanding cus­\ntomer to go directly to the service department instead of de­\npending on you for help, by explaining that his requests will \nbe handled with greater speed. \nAnother solution to conflicting priorities (his A, your C) is \ndiscussion. If you feel harassed at home, try sitting down \nwith your husband and listing your respective household du­\nties. This will put into perspective how much you are already \ndoing, and perhaps hell see that all the demands on your \ntime are unreasonable. This may never have occurred to him \nbefore, and you can adjust your duties to free more time for \nyour A's. \nWhen you are working in a cooperative effort with an as­\nsociate, start by reviewing your To Do List and his. Look for \nthose items which you both agree have high priority. Then \ntry to enlarge the area of agreement by examining those \nitems to which you have assigned different priorities. Express \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 87 \nyour point of view, and try to convince him that what he \nthought was an A is really a C. Listen to him, too, and try to \nunderstand his viewpoint. Be prepared to change your own \nassessment of the priorities if he can make a convincing case \nthat what you called a C is really an A. \nWhen agreement cannot be reached, trade-offs are a good \nidea. In return for doing his A (although it is of little value \nto you), ask that he do one of your A's. This also works well \nin reverse: \"I won't ask you to do this if you don't ask me to \ndo that\" isn't childish; it can be a handy way to rid yourself \nof time-consuming C's by simple exchange. \nTime-Sharing \nWhen there are several people competing for your time \nand attention, some system that is fair to everyone generally \nworks best. Sally of the steno pool, with half a dozen \"boss­\nes,\" does the work given to her in the order received. If Mr. \nBracken has a special rush job, it gets immediate attention. If \ntwo people in the office need their work \"right away,\" she \ncan't satisfy both demands. But she can set her own priorities, \npoint out the conflict and let them fight it out, or go to her \nsupervisor for a decision. \nTime-sharing, as fairness, can be particularly important to \nchildren, who will often compete for the time and attention \nof parents. For example, at our dinner table there is one \nseat—the one closest to my wife and me—that each of our \nchildren prefers. We'd like to have all our children sit next to \nus all the time but that's a physical impossibility. In the inter­\nest of fair play, we rotate the seat by using a simple numeri­\ncal system, taking the day of the month and dividing it by \nthree. If there's no remainder, it's our youngest child David's \nturn; if there's a remainder of one, our middle child Diane \ngets the seat; and if there's a remainder of two, the seat goes \nto Carol, the eldest. \nAt bedtime we use a different solution that assures each \nchild an equal share of attention. Fortunately they go to bed \nat different times. My wife sets a timer, and just before bed­\ntime",

You \ncan often satisfy other people and still not completely sacri­\nfice your own priorities if you look for compromises. \nWhen another person asks you to do something for him \nright away, he may well be more interested in speed than \nperfection. If you feel his demands on your time are reason­\nable, look for short-cuts. If your boss unexpectedly asks for a \nquick report on the month's sales, chances are hell settle for \na brief survey provided he gets it right away. If your daugh­\nter asks you on short notice to make her a new dress for a \nparty, propose a quickly-made skirt instead. \nOther people may habitually turn to you for particular \ntasks because you have, in effect, trained them to do so. \nMaybe it used to be your A to pack the family's lunches, but \nnow that the kids are older, you've found an interesting sell­\ning job. You'll have to wean them away from having mother \ndo it, perhaps by rotating the responsibility for preparing \nlunch. In business, you could encourage a demanding cus­\ntomer to go directly to the service department instead of de­\npending on you for help, by explaining that his requests will \nbe handled with greater speed. \nAnother solution to conflicting priorities (his A, your C) is \ndiscussion. If you feel harassed at home, try sitting down \nwith your husband and listing your respective household du­\nties. This will put into perspective how much you are already \ndoing, and perhaps hell see that all the demands on your \ntime are unreasonable. This may never have occurred to him \nbefore, and you can adjust your duties to free more time for \nyour A's. \nWhen you are working in a cooperative effort with an as­\nsociate, start by reviewing your To Do List and his. Look for \nthose items which you both agree have high priority. Then \ntry to enlarge the area of agreement by examining those \nitems to which you have assigned different priorities.

You \ncan often satisfy other people and still not completely sacri­\nfice your own priorities if you look for compromises. \nWhen another person asks you to do something for him \nright away, he may well be more interested in speed than \nperfection. If you feel his demands on your time are reason­\nable, look for short-cuts. If your boss unexpectedly asks for a \nquick report on the month's sales, chances are hell settle for \na brief survey provided he gets it right away. If your daugh­\nter asks you on short notice to make her a new dress for a \nparty, propose a quickly-made skirt instead. \nOther people may habitually turn to you for particular \ntasks because you have, in effect, trained them to do so. \nMaybe it used to be your A to pack the family",

If you feel harassed at home, try sitting down \nwith your husband and listing your respective household du­\nties. This will put into perspective how much you are already \ndoing, and perhaps hell see that all the demands on your \ntime are unreasonable.

Listen to him, too, and try to \nunderstand his viewpoint. Be prepared to change your own \nassessment of the priorities if he can make a convincing case \nthat what you called a C is really an A. \nWhen agreement cannot be reached, trade-offs are a good \nidea. In return for doing his A (although it is of little value \nto you), ask that he do one of your A's. This also works well \nin reverse: \"I won't ask you to do this if you don't ask me to \ndo that\" isn't childish; it can be a handy way to rid yourself \nof time-consuming C's by simple exchange. \nTime-Sharing \nWhen there are several people competing for your time \nand attention, some system that is fair to everyone generally \nworks best. Sally of the steno pool, with half a dozen \"boss­\nes,\" does the work given to her in the order received. If Mr. \nBracken has a special rush job, it gets immediate attention. If \ntwo people in the office need their work \"right away,\" she \ncan't satisfy both demands. But she can set her own priorities, \npoint out the conflict and let them fight it out, or go to her \nsupervisor for a decision. \nTime-sharing, as fairness, can be particularly important to \nchildren, who will often compete for the time and attention \nof parents. For example, at our dinner table there is one \nseat—the one closest to my wife and me—that each of our \nchildren prefers. We'd like to have all our children sit next to \nus all the time but that's a physical impossibility. In the inter­\nest of fair play, we rotate the seat by using a simple numeri­\ncal system, taking the day of the month and dividing it by \nthree. If there's no remainder, it's our youngest child David's \nturn; if there's a remainder of one, our middle child Diane \ngets the seat; and if there's a remainder of two, the seat",

    "text": " goes \nto Carol, the eldest. \nAt bedtime we use a different solution that assures each \nchild an equal share of attention. Fortunately they go to bed \nat different times. My wife sets a timer, and just before bed­\ntime, each child receives fifteen minutes of undivided parental \nattention to use in any way he or she wants. \nWhichever of the many strategies you adopt to keep other \n88 ALAN LAKEfN \npeople's requests from swamping you, it pays to be gracious. \nAnd if you make a special effort to be considerate of other \npeople and their time, they will be likely to respect you and \nyour time. \nAnd isn't that what you want—time to do your thing? \n12. HOW TO CREATE QUIET TIME \nFOR YOURSELF \nSo YOU HAVE blocked out time on your calendar for heavy \nthinking. Now the question is: Will you be left alone so you \ncan really concentrate? As any office worker knows, just be­\ncause you decide you want to be alone doesn't mean that vis­\nitors and telephone calls will magically stop intruding. Fur­\nthermore, are you sure you really want everybody to stay \naway from you? Most people need to be in touch with other \npeople to conduct their business. The point is that there are \nways to regulate this traffic. \n\"Do you have a minute?\" usually means \"May I have your \nattention now to talk about something that will take an un­\nspecified length of time?\" So the next time someone asks, \"Do \nyou have a minute?\" you might say, \"Can we really do it in a \nminute?\" or \"Sure, I have a minute now, but if it takes long-\nger we'll have to do it later.\" \nWho is doing all the interrupting in the first place? Are \nthey mostly V.U.P.'s (Very Unimportant Persons)? It pays to \nfind out. The first thing to do, if interruptions are a prob­\nlem, is keep a log of all telephone calls and visitors. Mr. \nJackson, the director of a non-profit foundation, kept such a \nlog for a week. It showed whether these time-snatchers were \nscheduled, who they were, and what they wanted. When he \nreviewed the log he found that the 80/20 rule applied. Eighty \npercent of his interruptions were coming from 20 percent of \nthe interrupters. And by far most of the interruptions were \ncoming from two people: an assistant and another subordi­\nnate. \nThis kind of traffic is easy to regulate, as Til show you \nshortly. But even if your boss is in the habit of calling you \ninto his office in the morning and wipes out your lovingly pol­\nished time plan by giving you an unexpected assignment that \ntakes most of the day, you needn't commit harakiri. Try \nthese ideas instead: \n89 \n90 ALAN LAKE IN \nEncourage your boss to warn you about such tasks the day \nbefore, if at all possible, so that you may plan your time \nmore realistically—not only for your benefit but for his. Is \nyour boss (or client) giving unnecessary priority to tasks that \ncould be adequately handled on a scheduled, non-rush basis, \nand might you point this out tactfully? \nIt's also worth asking yourself whether your boss is in the \nhabit of turning to you for this type of assignment because \nyou have in effect trained him to do so. If so, try being a bit \nless available, or delegate others to handle it instead. The \nsame goes for a demanding customer. If the situation war­\nrants, you may benefit from encouraging him to call the \nservice department or some other person instead of always \ndepending on you. \nMr. Jackson's case presented no great problem. He worked \nout a schedule with his assistant to see him at three scheduled \ntimes during the day: 9:30, 1:30, and 3:30. His assistant was \nto save all business for those times, except for the most urgent \nemergencies. The assistant had gotten into the habit of \njumping up and rushing into Mr. Jackson's office like a fire­\nman whenever anything came up. In the future he was never \nto interrupt Mr. Jackson unless convinced his mission was an \nA-item. \nThe other subordinate presented a different problem. This \nman, Anderson, was insecure in his job. In order to function, \nhe needed continual reassurance that he was doing everything \nright. He was constantly bothering Mr. Jackson with a \nstream of low-priority (vague, but urgent-sounding) matters \nthat he pressured Mr. Jackson to do right away. Also, Ander­\nson was overdependent and unable to make a decision on his \nown. He insisted",

    "text": " goes \nto Carol, the eldest. \nAt bedtime we use a different solution that assures each \nchild an equal share of attention. Fortunately they go to bed \nat different times. My wife sets a timer, and just before bed­\ntime, each child receives fifteen minutes of undivided parental \nattention to use in any way he or she wants. \nWhichever of the many strategies you adopt to keep other \n88 ALAN LAKEfN \npeople's requests from swamping you, it pays to be gracious. \nAnd if you make a special effort to be considerate of other \npeople and their time, they will be likely to respect you and \nyour time. \nAnd isn't that what you want—time to do your thing? \n12. HOW TO CREATE QUIET TIME \nFOR YOURSELF \nSo YOU HAVE blocked out time on your calendar for heavy \nthinking. Now the question is: Will you be left alone so you \ncan really concentrate? As any office worker knows, just be­\ncause you decide you want to be alone doesn't mean that vis­\nitors and telephone calls will magically stop intruding. Fur­\nthermore, are you sure you really want everybody to stay \naway from you? Most people need to be in touch with other \npeople to conduct their business. The point is that there are \nways to regulate this traffic. \n\"Do you have a minute?\" usually means \"May I have your \nattention now to talk about something that will take an un­\nspecified length of time?\" So the next time someone asks, \"Do \nyou have a minute?\" you might say, \"Can we really do it in a \nminute?\" or \"Sure, I have a minute now, but if it takes long-\nger we'll have to do it later.\" \nWho is doing all the interrupting in the first place? Are \nthey mostly V.U.P.'s (Very Unimportant Persons)? It pays to \nfind out. The first thing to do, if interruptions are a prob­\nlem, is keep a log of all telephone calls and visitors. Mr. \nJackson, the director of a non-profit foundation, kept such a \nlog for a week. It showed whether these time-snatchers were \nscheduled, who they were, and what they wanted. When he \nreviewed the log he found that the 80/20 rule applied. Eighty \npercent of his interruptions were coming from 20 percent of \nthe interrupters",

My wife sets a timer, and just before bed­\ntime, each child receives fifteen minutes of undivided parental \nattention to use in any way he or she wants. \nWhichever of the many strategies you adopt to keep other \n88 ALAN LAKEfN \npeople's requests from swamping you, it pays to be gracious. \nAnd if you make a special effort to be considerate of other \npeople and their time, they will be likely to respect you and \nyour time. \nAnd isn't that what you want—time to do your thing? \n12. HOW TO CREATE QUIET TIME \nFOR YOURSELF \nSo YOU HAVE blocked out time on your calendar for heavy \nthinking. Now the question is: Will you be left alone so you \ncan really concentrate? As any office worker knows, just be­\ncause you decide you want to be alone doesn't mean that vis­\nitors and telephone calls will magically stop intruding. Fur­\nthermore, are you sure you really want everybody to stay \naway from you? Most",

Eighty \npercent of his interruptions were coming from 20 percent of \nthe interrupters. And by far most of the interruptions were \ncoming from two people: an assistant and another subordi­\nnate. \nThis kind of traffic is easy to regulate, as Til show you \nshortly. But even if your boss is in the habit of calling you \ninto his office in the morning and wipes out your lovingly pol­\nished time plan by giving you an unexpected assignment that \ntakes most of the day, you needn't commit harakiri.

If so, try being a bit \nless available, or delegate others to handle it instead. The \nsame goes for a demanding customer.

He worked \nout a schedule with his assistant to see him at three scheduled \ntimes during the day: 9:30, 1:30, and 3:30. His assistant was \nto save all business for those times, except for the most urgent \nemergencies. The assistant had gotten into the habit of \njumping up and rushing into Mr. Jackson's office like a fire­\nman whenever anything came up. In the future he was never \nto interrupt Mr. Jackson unless convinced his mission was an \nA-item. \nThe other subordinate presented a different problem.

Also, Ander­\nson was overdependent and unable to make a decision on his \nown. He insisted on droning through all the details even when \nMr. Jackson didn't need them to make a choice. \nOn balance, though, Anderson had done good work, and \nMr. Jackson had never panted to hurt his feelings by telling \nhim to stop bugging him with trivia. Now Mr. Jackson de­\ncided that Anderson's milquetoastish ways were a luxury he \ncould no longer afford. Either Anderson would have to get \nalong better on his own or he could be replaced by someone \nwho didn't require so much of Mr. Jackson's time. Much as \nhe liked Anderson, Jackson couldn't afford the time that he \ncost. Eventually Anderson was transferred to another depart-\nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LD7E 91 \nment where he felt more secure, though the work was not as \nchallenging. \nThe log kept by Mr. Frank, another executive, revealed a \ndifferent pattern. Every two minutes or so he was interrupted \nby one of his many staff members. His solution was to reorga­\nnize, delegate more responsibility to his supervisors, and en­\ncourage his employees to look to the supervisors for answers \nto questions. He established weekly staff meetings, because \nhis log revealed that several people were asking him for in­\nformation requiring coordination with others. Mr. Frank also \nstarted sending background memos to the entire staff on \nroutine matters, since lack of information was creating unnec­\nessary interruptions of his work. \nWhen the Interrupter is a \nFour-Year-Old \nMs. Jones didn't need a log to tell her that her day was \nbeing constantly interrupted by her four-year-old daughter, \nMelinda. When Ms. Jones wanted to find time to finish an ex­\nciting novel, she went into the bedroom, closed the door, and \nbegan reading. Within two minutes Melinda was on \nMommy's lap. Disappointed, Ms. Jones consoled herself with \nthe thought that Melinda would grow up better-adjusted for \nhaving had her mother's attention in her formative years, and \nwent back to dreaming of next year, when Melinda would \nstart a half day of kindergarten and Mommy would have all \nthat time to herself. \nMs. Jones finally decided Melinda could be just as well-ad­\njusted if she had her mother's wholehearted attention only \nsome of the time instead of the half-hearted attention that is \nall any adult can muster when a child is watched without \nletup. After all, if Ms. Jones was in a better humor during \nher time with Melinda, she was sure to be a happier and \nmore creative mother. \nOne day she got the courage to put a latch on the bed­\nroom door, set the kitchen timer for thirty minutes, and told \nMelinda that she was going into her room to read for half an \nhour. She promised to play Fish when the timer bell went off. \nMelinda was to play in her room until it did. \nYou can't imagine the wailing and screams that Melinda \nproduced from her side of the bedroom door, but Ms. Jones \n92 ALAN LAKE IN \nsteeled herself and kept the door closed. She didn't get any \nreading done that first day because she was too anxious about \nthe effect her experiment would have on Melinda, but she set \nthe time for thirty minutes at 10:30 each day that week. By \nthe end of the week Melinda seemed to have adjusted to the \nnew system and played quietly in her room while Ms. Jones \nnot only finished her novel but was halfway through a second \none. \nContact Time vs. Thinking Time \nIf your log reveals that 80 percent of your interruptions \nare from new and/or different people, you obviously can't \nsolve the problem by talking to the key interrupters. If your \njob involves a great deal of public contact, you'd best answer \nthe phone or see the caller. But if you usually perform two \nroles, one requiring public contact and the other thinking \nalone, then you need some way to balance the demands of \nthe two roles so that the contact role doesn't interrupt the \nthinking role to death. \nAlthough he kept telling himself the new revision of his bill­\ning system was important, every time a visitor came his way \nMr. Bean took time out to talk to him—even when it was a \ntrivial matter that could have been handled by a subordinate. \nMr. Bean knew that the system revision was the big A-l, \nand he felt bad each evening when he went home after spend",

After all, if Ms. Jones was in a better humor during \nher time with Melinda, she was sure to be a happier and \nmore creative mother. \nOne day she got the courage to put a latch on the bed­\nroom door, set the kitchen timer for thirty minutes, and told \nMelinda that she was going into her room to read for half an \nhour. She promised to play Fish when the timer bell went off. \nMelinda was to play in her room until it did. \nYou can't imagine the wailing and screams that Melinda \nproduced from her side of the bedroom door, but Ms. Jones \n92 ALAN LAKE IN \nsteeled herself and kept the door closed. She didn't get any \nreading done that first day because she was too anxious about \nthe effect her experiment would have on Melinda, but she set \nthe time for thirty minutes at 10:30 each day that week. By \nthe end of the week Melinda seemed to have adjusted to the \nnew system and played quietly in her room while Ms. Jones \nnot only finished her novel but was halfway through a second \none. \nContact Time vs. Thinking Time \nIf your log reveals that 80 percent of your interruptions \nare from new and/or different people, you obviously can't \nsolve the problem by talking to the key interrupters. If your \njob involves a great deal of public contact, you'd best answer \nthe phone or see the caller. But if you usually perform two \nroles, one requiring public contact and the other thinking \nalone, then you need some way to balance the demands of \nthe two roles so that the contact role doesn't interrupt the \nthinking role to death. \nAlthough he kept telling himself the new revision of his bill­\ning system was important, every time a visitor came his way \nMr. Bean took time out",

    "text": " to talk to him—even when it was a \ntrivial matter that could have been handled by a subordinate. \nMr. Bean knew that the system revision was the big A-l, \nand he felt bad each evening when he went home after spend­\ning little time on it. He blamed the constant interruptions. \nThe truth was that Mr. Bean blew hot and cold on interrup­\ntions. Sometimes he sought them out; at other times he resent­\ned even the important ones. When he was interrupted in the \nmiddle of an intricate part of the revision plan he was an­\nnoyed. Even if a very big customer was on the phone, Mr. \nBean didn't think, \"That's my job calling.\" Instead, he \nshrugged and fumed. \"How can I get my work done?\" \nMr. Bean's solution to the problem of conflicting job func­\ntions was to alternate between them, to the detriment of \nboth. Was there a better way? \nMr. Bean contemplnted not answering the phone and re­\nfusing to see visitors. This would give him time to think, and \nthe system revision would probably get done nicely. But then \nwhat were the risks in not being available?* He might offend \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 93 \nother people who would want and expect to talk to him. His \nstaff might fail to coordinate with him, and mix-ups might re­\nsult. Morale might decline, because he might not learn of \ngripes and complaints until they had built to a crisis propor­\ntion. \nWhat he did do was little better. He allowed anyone to see \nhim any time. But rather than paying careful attention to \ntheir problems, he was often preoccupied with his own inter­\nrupted one. He was nervous and tense about getting back to \nhis work,\" and since he was too \"busy\" to listen carefully, he \nmade visitors sorry they had ever come. \nSet Up Availability Hours \nI suggested that perhaps a better solution would be to \ncreate special \"Availability Hours.\" We're all familiar with \nsigns saying: \"Salesmen seen only Tuesday and Thursday \nfrom 1-4\" or \"The Doctor sees patients only on Monday, \nTuesday and Wednesday.\" Availability Hours are those hours \nduring the week when you're available to associates or others \nwithout appointment. At such times visitors may walk \nthrough your \"open door\" and feel free to discuss business, \nassured that their viewpoint will receive undivided attention. \nMr. Bean decided to set up Availability Hours from 8 to \n9:30 and again from 11 to 12 in the morning, leaving 9:30 \nto 11 as Quiet Time. He instructed the switchboard operator \nto take all routine calls during his Quiet Time so that he \ncould work without interruption. \nQuiet Time Can Backfire \nLuckily, Mr. Bean remembered the case of Mr. Kent, who \nunexpectedly and unilaterally decreed that absolutely no one \nwas to disturb him during Quiet Time between 8 and noon. \nThe results were catastrophic. His subordinates struggled on \ntheir own, and hence made many more mistakes. Morale \ndropped, and his failure to take note of this reduced it even \nfurther. For a time Mr. Kent received congratulations from \nhis boss. He seemed to be doing the right thing. The bravos \ndied down when the state of organizational decline was fully \nappreciated. Eventually Mr. Kent was fired—in effect, be-\n94 ALAN LAKF.rN \ncause of his failure to balance Quiet Time and Availability \nTime. \nSo Mr. Bean discussed his proposed new arrangement with \nhis key people and made changes based on their suggestions. \nSeveral thought they would try a little experimenting on their \nown, because they had also felt the need to get their own \nwork done without interruptions. Mr. Bean made sure that \nthey would bring to his attention any fallout that his pro­\nposed schedule might have on their jobs during the readjust­\nment period. \nHow do you set aside Quiet Time and block out interrup­\ntions? \nIf you're a top executive, it's a cinch: just tell your secre­\ntary to Lake all your calls, turn any emergencies over to your \nExecutive Assistant, and close the door of your private office. \nIf you don't have a secretary or switchboard operator to \ntake your calls, you might tie up your telephone line a half \nhour a day by dialing your own number and leaving the \nphone off the hook so anyone calling you will get a busy sig­\nnal. \nYou also need to keep others from coming by to talk to \nyou during your Quiet Time. \nMr. Bean remained fair game for his colleagues so long as \nthey saw that he was alone and",

He blamed the constant interruptions. \nThe truth was that Mr. Bean blew hot and cold on interrup­\ntions. Sometimes he sought them out; at other times he resent­\ned even the important ones. When he was interrupted in the \nmiddle of an intricate part of the revision plan he was an­\nnoyed. Even if a very big customer was on the phone, Mr. \nBean didn't think, \"That's my job calling.\" Instead, he \nshrugged and fumed. \"How can I get my work done?\" \nMr. Bean's solution to the problem of conflicting job func­\ntions was to alternate between them, to the detriment of \nboth. Was there a better way? \nMr. Bean contemplnted not answering the phone and re­\nfusing to see visitors. This would give him time to think, and \nthe system revision would probably get done nicely.

    "text": " to talk to him—even when it was a \ntrivial matter that could have been handled by a subordinate. \nMr. Bean knew that the system revision was the big A-l, \nand he felt bad each evening when he went home after spend­\ning little time on it. He blamed the constant interruptions. \nThe truth was that Mr. Bean blew hot and cold on interrup­\ntions. Sometimes he sought them out; at other times he resent­\ned even the important ones. When he was interrupted in the \nmiddle of an intricate part of the revision plan he was an­\nnoyed.

Was there a better way? \nMr. Bean contemplnted not answering the phone and re­\nfusing to see visitors. This would give him time to think, and \nthe system revision would probably get done nicely. But then \nwhat were the risks",

    "text": " 1-4\" or \"The Doctor sees patients only on Monday, \nTuesday and Wednesday.\" Availability Hours are those hours \nduring the week when you're available to associates or others \nwithout appointment. At such times visitors may walk \nthrough your \"open door\" and feel free to discuss business, \nassured that their viewpoint will receive undivided attention. \nMr. Bean decided to set up Availability Hours from 8 to \n9:30 and again from 11 to 12 in the morning, leaving 9:30 \nto 11 as Quiet Time. He instructed the switchboard operator \nto take all routine calls during his Quiet Time so that he \ncould work without interruption. \nQuiet Time Can Backfire \nLuckily, Mr. Bean remembered the case of Mr. Kent, who \nunexpectedly and unilaterally decreed that absolutely no one \nwas to disturb him during Quiet Time between 8 and noon. \nThe results were catastrophic. His subordinates struggled on \ntheir own, and hence made many more mistakes. Morale \ndropped, and his failure to take note of this reduced it even \nfurther. For a time Mr. Kent received congratulations from \nhis boss. He seemed to be doing the right thing. The bravos \ndied down when the state of organizational decline was fully \nappreciated. Eventually Mr. Kent was fired—in effect, be-\n94 ALAN LAKF.rN \ncause of his failure to balance Quiet Time and Availability \nTime. \nSo Mr. Bean discussed his proposed new arrangement with \nhis key people and made changes based on their suggestions. \nSeveral thought they would try a little experimenting on their \nown, because they had also felt the need to get their own \nwork done without interruptions. Mr. Bean made sure that \nthey would bring to his attention any fallout that his pro­\nposed schedule might have on their jobs during the readjust­\nment period. \nHow do you set aside Quiet Time and block out interrup­\ntions? \nIf you're a top executive, it's a cinch: just tell your secre­\ntary to Lake all your calls, turn any emergencies over to your \nExecutive Assistant, and close the door of your private office. \nIf you don't have a secretary or switchboard operator to \ntake your calls, you might tie up your telephone line a half \nhour a day by dialing your own number and leaving the \nphone off the hook so anyone calling you",

    "text": " will get a busy sig­\nnal. \nYou also need to keep others from coming by to talk to \nyou during your Quiet Time. \nMr. Bean remained fair game for his colleagues so long as \nthey saw that he was alone and therefore \"not doing anything \nimportant.'' But then he told them about his idea of Quiet \nTime and put a sign on his desk that said \"Quiet Time, please \nreturn at 11:30.\" Whenever someone approached him during \nQuiet Time, he pointed to the sign, asked whether the caller \ncould wait until then, and made sure to get back to the inter­\nrupter promptly at 11:30. \nWhen he was particularly in need of concentration, he \nlooked around for an unused office or conference room. \nSometimes he went to the public library. (A top executive \nconfided to me that when he wanted Quiet Time he hid out \nin the back of a small coffee shop two blocks from his corpo­\nration's headquarters building.) \nHow To Handle the Sociables \nMr. Bean also found from his log that many people just \nstopped by to chat. He was on the main route to the water \ncooler and anyone running away from a difficult job back at \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OP YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 95 \nhis desk found him easy game for a few minutes of relaxing. \nHe therefore shifted his desk to a different angle. Then he \ntook away the extra visitor's chair, because he found that \nwhen two escapees got talking together at his desk it meant a \nminimum of twenty minutes' time wasted. Finally, he tried to \nkeep his head down so that he didn't catch the eyes of pass-\nersby. \nThe next problem Mr. Bean encountered was that he be­\ncame lonesome during Quiet Time. He was so accustomed to \ntalking to people that he kept hoping someone would inter­\nrupt him. Every time the phone rang, even though he knew \nhis secretary would pick it up. he couldn't help wondering \nwho was calling and what they wanted. Although it took a \nlot of willpower, he resisted the tendencies to pick up the \nphone himself or to jump up right afterward to get the mes­\nsage. \nHe found it difficult not to be helpful to whomever came \nhis way, and though his secretary managed to keep many vis­\nitors away, those in his own organization who ignored her \nand marched right into his office with \"Do you have a min-\nute?\"-type questions usually got his attention. \nMr. Bean still found it difficult to say \"no\" to anyone. But \nwhen he tried it a few times, he was surprised: Nothing seri­\nous happened. He found that most of the interrupters were \nsimply in the habit of coming in and really could wait until \nlater—and so could his own need to have other people \naround. Gradually he became more firm. His tone indicated \nhe was not angry with the interrupter, but he was insistent \nthat the other person respect his Quiet Time. \nAlternating Quiet Time with Availability Hours worked \nwell for Mr. Bean and it can work well for you too. \n13. ASK LAKEIN'S QUESTION \nYOUR LIFETIME GOALS STATEMENT, your To Do List, and \nyour Schedule give you substantial control over the way you \nspend your time. Each of these is an extremely valuable plan­\nning tool. But they are not handy for the minute-to-minuto \ndecisions you have to make. \nWho can take fifteen minutes to plan a dozen times a day? \nNobody. You wouldn't get anything done. Which is why I'm \ngoing to hand you a new tool to use quickly and spontane­\nously as many times a day as you need it. It's called \"ask \nLakein's Question.\" Lake ins Question is: what is the best use \nof my time right now? \nAt first you'll have to remind yourself to keep asking \nLakein's Question whenever you're not positive whether \nyou're using your time to best advantage. After a week or so \nit should become second nature to you. \nIf your first answer when you ask Lakein's Question is *1 \ndon't know,\" then the best use of your time is to ask the \nquestion again. If you still get \"I don't know,\" then tell your­\nself: \"I already know that; but I still need a better answer.\" \nI don't mean to turn this into some silly game of hide-\nand-seek. I do suggest to you that if you really don't know \nthe best use of your time, then there's nothing more impor­\ntant than finding out. So do keep asking Lakein's Question \nuntil you get at least some sort of meaningful answer. \nAs soon as you get the first answer, stop.",

But then he told them about his idea of Quiet \nTime and put a sign on his desk that said \"Quiet Time, please \nreturn at 11:30.\" Whenever someone approached him during \nQuiet Time, he pointed to the sign, asked whether the caller \ncould wait until then, and made sure to get back to the inter­\nrupter promptly at 11:30. \nWhen he was particularly in need of concentration, he \nlooked around for an unused office or conference room. \nSometimes he went to the public library. (A top executive \nconfided to me that when he wanted Quiet Time he hid out \nin the back of a small coffee shop two blocks from his corpo­\nration's headquarters building.) \nHow To Handle the Sociables \nMr. Bean also found from his log that many people just \nstopped by to chat. He was on the main route to the water \ncooler and anyone running away from a difficult job back at \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OP YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 95 \nhis desk found him easy game for a few minutes of relaxing. \nHe therefore shifted his desk to a different angle. Then he \ntook away the extra visitor's chair, because he found that \nwhen two escapees got talking together at his desk it meant a \nminimum of twenty minutes' time wasted. Finally, he tried to \nkeep his head down so that he didn't catch the eyes of pass-\nersby. \nThe next problem Mr. Bean encountered was that he be­\ncame lonesome during Quiet Time. He was so accustomed to \ntalking to people that he kept hoping someone would inter­\nrupt him. Every time the phone rang, even though he knew \nhis secretary would pick it up. he couldn't help wondering \nwho was calling and what they wanted. Although it took a \nlot of willpower, he resisted the tendencies to pick up the \nphone himself or to jump up right afterward to get the mes­\nsage. \nHe found it difficult not to be helpful to whomever came \nhis way, and though his secretary managed to keep many vis­\nitors away, those in his own organization who ignored her \nand marched right",

But then he told them about his idea of Quiet \nTime and put a sign on his desk that said \"Quiet Time, please \nreturn at 11:30.\" Whenever someone approached him during \nQuiet Time, he pointed to the sign, asked whether the caller \ncould wait until then, and made sure to get back to the inter­\nrupter promptly at 11:30. \nWhen he was particularly in need of concentration, he \nlooked around for an unused office or conference room. \nSometimes he went to the public library.

But \nwhen he tried it a few times, he was surprised: Nothing seri­\nous happened. He found that most of the interrupters were \nsimply in the habit of coming in and really could wait until \nlater—and so could his own need to have other people \naround. Gradually he became more firm. His tone indicated \nhe was not angry with the interrupter, but he was insistent \nthat the other person respect his Quiet Time. \nAlternating Quiet Time with Availability Hours worked \nwell for Mr. Bean and it can work well for you too. \n13. ASK LAKEIN'S QUESTION \nYOUR LIFETIME GOALS STATEMENT, your To Do List, and \nyour Schedule give you substantial control over the way you \nspend your time. Each of these is an extremely valuable plan­\nning tool. But they are not handy for the minute-to-minuto \ndecisions you have to make. \nWho can take fifteen minutes to plan a dozen times a day? \nNobody. You wouldn't get anything done. Which is why I'm \ngoing to hand you a new tool to use quickly and spontane­\nously as many times a day as you need it. It's called \"ask \nLakein's Question.\" Lake ins Question is: what is the best use \nof my time right now? \nAt first you'll have to remind yourself to keep asking \nLakein's Question whenever you're not positive whether \nyou're using your time to best advantage. After a week or so \nit should become second nature to you. \nIf your first answer when you ask Lakein's Question is *1 \ndon't know,\" then the best use of your time is to ask the \nquestion again. If you still get \"I don't know,\" then tell your­\nself: \"I already know that; but I still need a better answer.\" \nI don't mean to turn this into some silly game of hide-\nand-seek. I do suggest to you that if you really don't know \nthe best use",

But \nwhen he tried it a few times, he was surprised: Nothing seri­\nous happened. He found that most of the interrupters were \nsimply in the habit of coming in and really could wait until \nlater—and so could his own need to have other people \naround. Gradually he became more firm. His tone indicated \nhe was not angry with the interrupter, but he was insistent \nthat the other person respect his Quiet Time. \nAlternating Quiet Time with Availability Hours worked \nwell for Mr. Bean and it can work well for you too. \n13. ASK LAKEIN'S QUESTION \nYOUR LIFETIME GOALS STATEMENT, your To Do List, and \nyour Schedule give you substantial control over the way you \nspend your time. Each of these is an extremely valuable plan",

Each of these is an extremely valuable plan­\nning tool. But they are not handy for the minute-to-minuto \ndecisions you have to make. \nWho can take fifteen minutes to plan a dozen times a day? \nNobody. You wouldn't get anything done. Which is why I'm \ngoing to hand you a new tool to use quickly and spontane­\nously as many times a day as you need it. It's called \"ask \nLakein's Question.\" Lake ins Question is: what is the best use \nof my time right now? \nAt first you'll have to remind yourself to keep asking \nLakein's Question whenever you're not positive whether \nyou're using your time to best advantage. After a week or so \nit should become second nature to you. \nIf your first answer when you ask Lakein's Question is *1 \ndon't know,\" then the best use of your time is to ask the \nquestion again. If you still get \"I don't know,\" then tell your­\nself",

    "text": " of your time, then there's nothing more impor­\ntant than finding out. So do keep asking Lakein's Question \nuntil you get at least some sort of meaningful answer. \nAs soon as you get the first answer, stop. \nAlmost invariably, the first (and spontaneous) answer to \nLakein's Question is the best, and you should accept it. But a \nmistake is always a possibility. So take just a moment to \nmake your \"go/no-go\" decision. Your intuition may have \ntaken the morning off. If you feel you can't act on your first \nanswer, it's best to come up with an acceptable alternative at \nonce. \nLike all new habits, asking Lakein's Question takes a bit of \n96 \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 97 \npractice. As you adopt this routine, you'll find that your con­\nfidence increases, and that you come up consistently with \ngood answers the first time around. \nAsk Lakem's Question All the Time! \nA particularly good time to ask Lakem's Question is when \nyou have been interrupted by a visitor or telephone call (as­\nsuming that the interruption is desirable or necessary in the \nfirst place). When it's over, check whether you should go \nback to what you were doing or on to something new. \nAlso ask Lakein's Question when you notice that you are \nbecoming distracted. Are you listening to a conversation in \nthe next office? Wondering who just walked down the hall? \nDaydreaming about next year's vacation? Pop the question! \nAlso ask when you intuitively feel you may not be making \nthe best use of your time. Or you detect a tendency to pro­\ncrastinate. Or when you pause momentarily in the middle of \ndoing an A-l. Or when you find yourself shuffling paper \nrather than processing it. \nAsk it when you're torn between two different projects. \nWhen you run out of steam. Or at points where it seems \nnatural to make the transition to something else. \nTo help you remember to ask Lakein's Question, put up \nsigns around you saying \"What is the best use of my time \nnow?\" and \"Ask Lakein's Question\" printed on them. The \nsigns can be as visible as you wish. How about a large sign \ndirectly across from where you normally sit? How about \nusing them as posters all over the house? Or if you want the \nsigns to be less conspicuous, how about in a drawer or in \nyour private notebook? You might even get some stationery \nwith the question printed on it. (I once had pencils made up \nfor my clients with Lakein's Question inscribed on them.) \nEven if you know what the A-l is and have started it, you \ncan still ask Lakein's Question, but be a little more specific: \nWhat is the best use of my time now on the A-l? What part \nshall I do, and how shall I do it?\" \nConsider simplifying the task. Consider making it easier or \nfaster. Should you phone or visit that slow-poke in the other \ndepartment? Would it be better to write a letter to that \nlong-winded customer so he doesn't gab on forever on the \n98 ALAN LAKE IN \nphone—or do you really need a give-and-take discussion with \nhim to get a quick decision? \nA fast work place is also a strength. The ability to work \nvery rapidly and perform well pays off, so check your work \npace periodically by asking Lakein's Question. Maybe you're \nstill hung up on last week's details. It happens. \nYou can also waste time on items that were once A's—but \nare A's no longer. Is that big order likely to be canceled? Has \nthe deadline changed? Is that difficult account executive \nabout to get fired? A former A may decline in value to B and \nthen CZ not only with the passing of time, but also with the \ndegree of its completion. The 80/20 rule suggests that 80 per­\ncent of the value is often gained during the first 20 percent \nof your work time on a certain task. Being a perfectionist \nmay mean that you're working much too hard to get only \nminimum value. \nWhen Perfectionism Helps— \nand When It Doesn't \nPerfectionism is worth approaching when 80 percent of the \nvalue comes from the last 20 percent of the effort. For exam­\nple: the construction of a dam, bringing home the family's \nfavorite groceries, unstopping a plugged-up sink, remember­\ning your wedding anniversary every year. \nPerfectionism is a waste of time on such labors as ironing \nevery last wrinkle out of a sheet or re-checking a low-prior­\nity letter for",

    "text": " of your time, then there's nothing more impor­\ntant than finding out. So do keep asking Lakein's Question \nuntil you get at least some sort of meaningful answer. \nAs soon as you get the first answer, stop. \nAlmost invariably, the first (and spontaneous) answer to \nLakein's Question is the best, and you should accept it. But a \nmistake is always a possibility. So take just a moment to \nmake your \"go/no-go\" decision. Your intuition may have \ntaken the morning off. If you feel you can't act on your first \nanswer, it's best to come up with an acceptable alternative at \nonce. \nLike all new habits, asking Lakein's Question takes a bit of \n96 \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 97 \npractice. As you adopt this routine, you'll find that your con­\nfidence increases, and that you come up consistently with \ngood answers the first time around. \nAsk Lakem's Question All the Time! \nA particularly good time to ask Lakem's Question is when \nyou have been interrupted by a visitor or telephone call (as­\nsuming that the interruption is desirable or necessary in the \nfirst place). When it's over, check whether you should go \nback to what you were doing or on to something new. \nAlso ask Lakein's Question when you notice that you are \nbecoming distracted. Are you listening to a conversation in \nthe next office? Wondering who just walked down the hall? \nDaydreaming about next year's vacation? Pop the question! \nAlso ask when you intuitively feel you may not be making \nthe best use of your time. Or you detect a tendency to pro­\ncrastinate. Or when you pause momentarily in the middle of \ndoing an A-l. Or when you find yourself shuffling paper \nrather than processing it. \nAsk it when you're torn between two different projects. \nWhen you run out of steam. Or at points where it seems \nnatural to make the transition to something else. \nTo help you remember to ask Lakein's Question, put up \nsigns around you saying \"What is the best use of my time \nnow?\" and \"Ask Lakein's Question\" printed on them. The \nsigns can be as visible as you wish. How about a large sign \ndirectly across from where you normally sit? How about \nusing them as posters all over",

When it's over, check whether you should go \nback to what you were doing or on to something new. \nAlso ask Lakein's Question when you notice that you are \nbecoming distracted. Are you listening to a conversation in \nthe next office? Wondering who just walked down the hall? \nDaydreaming about next year's vacation? Pop the question! \nAlso ask when you intuitively feel you may not be making \nthe best use of your time. Or you detect a tendency to pro­\ncrastinate. Or when you pause momentarily in the middle of \ndoing an A-l. Or when you find yourself shuffling paper \nrather than processing it. \nAsk it when you're torn between two different projects. \nWhen you run out of steam. Or at points where it seems \nnatural to make the transition to something else. \nTo help you remember to ask Lakein's Question, put up \nsigns around you saying \"What is the best use of my time \n",

How about \nusing them as posters all over the house? Or if you want the \nsigns to be less conspicuous, how about in a drawer or in \nyour private notebook? You might even get some stationery \nwith the question printed on it. (I once had pencils made up \nfor my clients with Lakein's Question inscribed on them.) \nEven if you know what the A-l is and have started it, you \ncan still ask Lakein's Question, but be a little more specific: \nWhat is the best use of my time now on the A-l? What part \nshall I do, and how shall I do it?\" \nConsider simplifying the task. Consider making it easier or \nfaster. Should you phone or visit that slow-poke in the other \ndepartment? Would it be better to write a letter to that \nlong-winded customer so he doesn't gab on forever on the \n98 ALAN LAKE IN \nphone—or do you really need a give-and-take discussion with \nhim to get a quick decision? \nA fast work place is also a strength. The ability to work \nvery rapidly and perform well pays off, so check your work \npace periodically by asking Lakein's Question. Maybe you're \nstill hung up on last week's details. It happens. \nYou can also waste time on items that were once A's—but \nare A's no longer. Is that big order likely to be canceled? Has \nthe deadline changed? Is that difficult account executive \nabout to get fired? A former A may decline in value to B and \nthen CZ not only with the passing of time, but also with the \ndegree of its completion. The 80/20 rule suggests that 80 per­\ncent of the value is often gained during the first 20 percent \nof your work time on a certain task. Being a perfectionist \nmay mean that you're working much too hard to get only \nminimum value. \nWhen Perfectionism Helps— \nand When It Doesn't \nPerfectionism is worth approaching when 80 percent of the \nvalue comes from the last 20 percent of the effort.

The ability to work \nvery rapidly and perform well pays off, so check your work \npace periodically by asking Lakein's Question. Maybe you're \nstill hung up on last week's details.

The 80/20 rule suggests that 80 per­\ncent of the value is often gained during the first 20 percent \nof your work time on a certain task.

    "text": " sink, remember­\ning your wedding anniversary every year. \nPerfectionism is a waste of time on such labors as ironing \nevery last wrinkle out of a sheet or re-checking a low-prior­\nity letter for typing errors. Once you get immersed in some \nactivities, they seem to acquire a momentum of their own. \nYou may then be carried along without control, drifting with \nthe tide. \nOne way to combat this drift is to set yourself control \npoints for reviewing your progress. Check every fifteen min­\nutes or half an hour—or go on until 3:30 and then review. \nOne way to remember to do this is to use a kitchen timer. If \nyou're not benefiting from continued effort, stop and change \nto do something else. \nYou can also set the timer to help you meet deadlines. If \nyou need to get something done in half an hour, set the timer \naccordingly. If you find the ticking annoying, put it in the \nbottom drawer; then you'll hear only the bell. Suppose the \ntimer rings and you're still not finished? To protect yourself, \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 99 \ndon't set the timer for thirty minutes; set it for twenty. Then \nyou can re-set priorities after twenty minutes. Are you sure \nyou're on the right track? You might want to set the timer \nfor another fifteen minutes as a reminder that the project is \nprobably not worth any more time. \nDo you suspect diminishing returns? Are you being need­\nlessly perfectionistic? Ask Lakein's Question. If you're not \nsure whether it is worth finishing something (or worth contin­\nuing), I suggest that you stop. If you don't come back to it, \nthen in fact you were done. If you feel uncomfortable the \nnext day about having stopped and you want to continue, go \nback to it But pretty soon . . . right! Ask Lakein's Question \nagain.",

    "text": " sink, remember­\ning your wedding anniversary every year. \nPerfectionism is a waste of time on such labors as ironing \nevery last wrinkle out of a sheet or re-checking a low-prior­\nity letter for typing errors. Once you get immersed in some \nactivities, they seem to acquire a momentum of their own. \nYou may then be carried along without control, drifting with \nthe tide. \nOne way to combat this drift is to set yourself control \npoints for reviewing your progress. Check every fifteen min­\nutes or half an hour—or go on until 3:30 and then review. \nOne way to remember to do this is to use a kitchen timer. If \nyou're not benefiting from continued effort, stop and change \nto do something else. \nYou can also set the timer to help you meet deadlines. If \nyou need to get something done in half an hour, set the timer \naccordingly. If you find the ticking annoying, put it in the \nbottom drawer; then you'll hear only the bell. Suppose the \ntimer rings and you're still not finished? To protect yourself, \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 99 \ndon't set the timer for thirty minutes; set it for twenty. Then \nyou can re-set priorities after twenty minutes. Are you sure \nyou're on the right track? You might want to set the timer \nfor another fifteen minutes as a reminder that the project is \nprobably not worth any more time. \nDo you suspect diminishing returns? Are you being need­\nlessly perfectionistic? Ask Lakein's Question. If you're not \nsure whether it is worth finishing something (or worth contin­\nuing), I suggest that you stop. If you don't come back to it, \nthen in fact you were done. If you feel uncomfortable the \nnext day about having stopped and you want to continue, go \nback to it But pretty soon . . . right! Ask Lakein's Question \nagain.",

Once you get immersed in some \nactivities, they seem to acquire a momentum of their own. \nYou may then be carried along without control, drifting with \nthe tide. \nOne way to combat this drift is to set yourself control \npoints for reviewing your progress. Check every fifteen min­\nutes or half an hour—or go on until 3:30 and then review. \nOne way to remember to do this is to use a kitchen timer. If \nyou're not benefiting from continued effort, stop and change \nto do something else. \nYou can also set the timer to help you meet deadlines. If \nyou need to get something done in half an hour, set the timer \naccordingly. If you find the ticking annoying, put it in the \nbottom drawer; then you'll hear only the bell. Suppose the \ntimer rings and you're still not finished? To protect yourself, \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 99 \ndon't set the timer for",
