THE REAL PRICE OF DELAY \nWHEN YOU'RE AT DECISION TIME and suspect you're about \nto procrastinate on an unpleasant A-l, taking a moment to \ncontemplate the consequences of delay can often get you \nback on the track. Let me tell you about a woman who hated \nto write thank-you notes. \nAnne Davis receives a birthday gift from out of town. She \ntells herself that she must take a few minutes right away and \ndrop Aunt Mary a note. A few lines will do: \"I got the \nsweater. It looks beautiful and is just my size. Thank you so \nvery much.\" \nBut Ms. Davis, being something of a perfectionist, really \ndoesn't want to settle for such an insipid note—she'd like to \nwrite something with more verve. After alL she doesn't want \nAunt Mary to think that her four years of college were a to­\ntal waste 1 She doesn't feel up to being eloquent at the mo­\nment (and, of course, she has a hundred other things to do), \nso she puts off thanking Aunt Mary for now. \nTwo weeks pass before she faces up to the fact that she \nstill has not written to Aunt Mary. By this time, she figures, \nAunt Mary is getting somewhat impatient. Well, she'll make \nup for the delay by sending off a charming two-page letter \ntelling her all about how often she wears the sweater, how \nwell it goes with several of her skirts, how comfortable it is, \nand how many compliments she has received from friends. \nShe doesn't have time to write such a long letter now . . . but \nshe tells herself she'll be sure to get around to it very soon. \nTwo more weeks go by, and now Ms. Davis is feeling very \nangry with herself. She is so ashamed, and so afraid of what \nAunt Mary must think of her. Surely she'll tell everyone in \nthe family what a lazy, ungrateful niece she has! Ms. Davis \nwill have to think up some pretty good excuses. \"Everytime I \nsit down to write you, the phone rings,\" or \"This has been \nthe busiest month of my life\" will perhaps do the trick. \n134 \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 135 \nHopefully, if she fills her letter with enough personal anec­\ndotes about her hectic life, Aunt Mary will forgive her. \nHow the Problem Escalates \nAt this point, writing the thank-you note has become very \nimportant and very unpleasant. It's not surprising that Ms. \nDavis hates writing thank-you notes! She starts worrying \nabout the letter whenever she has an odd moment. She con­\nstructs the note in her head while taking a shower and while \ntaking out the garbage, but this doesn't bring her any closer \nto getting the letter written. \nMs. Davis starts feeling terribly guilty—so guilty, in fact, \nthe thought of the letter makes her sick. In order to avoid \nthis, she now blocks out of her mind any thought of the un­\nwritten note. \nFinally one day the unwritten note comes back to haunt \nher, and Ms. Davis acknowledges to herself that it is Deci­\nsion Time. Should she: (1) write a ten-page letter bringing \nAunt Mary up-to-date on life with the Davis family for the \nlast two years, and off-handedly sneak in a thank-you for the \nsweater? (2) wait another nine months and if Aunt Mary \nsends another birthday present (hopefully she won't!) thank \nher for both presents at the same time? (3) pretend she \nnever received the sweater? (4) wait until she goes back \nhome for a visit, and then impress Aunt Mary with how she \nremembered the sweater after all these years and was waiting \nto thank her in person? (5) telephone Aunt Mary long-dis­\ntance and after a half an hour of chit-chat (at considerable \ncost) to soften her up, thank her? or (6) give up any hope of \never being able to face Aunt Mary again because how can \nshe ever explain why she couldn't find five minutes to write \na quick note the week the sweater arrived? \nWhat Is the Price of Delay? \nMs. Davis's delay in thanking Aunt Mary cost her many \nminutes of anguish. She would have suffered less had she \nslowed down and made a deliberate effort to recall the conse­\nquences of her past delays: Her Aunt had felt slighted before \n136 ALAN LAKEIN \nand her own mother had written an admonishing letter about \nit. She knew from prior experience how each week of pro­\ncrastination in writing a thank-you note escalated both the \nsize of the task and",

THE REAL PRICE OF DELAY \nWHEN YOU'RE AT DECISION TIME and suspect you're about \nto procrastinate on an unpleasant A-l, taking a moment to \ncontemplate the consequences of delay can often get you \nback on the track. Let me tell you about a woman who hated \nto write thank-you notes. \nAnne Davis receives a birthday gift from out of town. She \ntells herself that she must take a few minutes right away and \ndrop Aunt Mary a note. A few lines will do: \"I got the \nsweater. It looks beautiful and is just my size. Thank you so \nvery much.\" \nBut Ms. Davis, being something of a perfectionist, really \ndoesn't want to settle for such an insipid note—she'd like to \nwrite something with more verve. After alL she doesn't want \nAunt Mary to think that her four years of college were a to­\ntal waste 1 She doesn't feel up to being eloquent at the mo­\nment (and, of course, she has a hundred other things to do), \nso she puts off thanking Aunt Mary for now. \nTwo weeks pass before she faces up to the fact that she \nstill has not written to Aunt Mary. By this time, she figures, \nAunt Mary is getting somewhat impatient. Well, she'll make \nup for the delay by sending off a charming two-page letter \ntelling her all about how often she wears the sweater, how \nwell it goes with several of her skirts, how comfortable it is, \nand how many compliments she has received from friends. \nShe doesn't have time to write such a long letter now . . . but \nshe tells herself she'll be sure to get around to it very soon. \nTwo more weeks go by, and now Ms. Davis is feeling very \nangry with herself. She is so ashamed, and so afraid of what \nAunt Mary must think of her. Surely she'll tell everyone in \nthe family what a lazy, ungrateful niece she has! Ms. Davis \nwill have to think up some pretty good excuses. \"Everytime I \nsit down to write you, the phone rings,\" or \"This has been \nthe busiest month of my life\" will perhaps do the trick. \n134 \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 135 \nHopefully, if she fills her letter with enough personal anec­\ndotes",

It's not surprising that Ms. \nDavis hates writing thank-you notes! She starts worrying \nabout the letter whenever she has an odd moment. She con­\nstructs the note in her head while taking a shower and while \ntaking out the garbage, but this doesn't bring her any closer \nto getting the letter written. \nMs. Davis starts feeling terribly guilty—so guilty, in fact, \nthe thought of the letter makes her sick. In order to avoid \nthis, she now blocks out of her mind any thought of the un­\nwritten note. \nFinally one day the unwritten note comes back to haunt \nher, and Ms. Davis acknowledges to herself that it is Deci­\nsion Time. Should she: (1) write a ten-page letter bringing \nAunt Mary up-to-date on life with the Davis family for the \nlast two years, and off-handedly sneak in a thank-you for the \nsweater? (2) wait another nine months and if Aunt Mary \nsends another birthday present (hopefully she won't!) thank \nher for both presents at the same time? (3) pretend she \nnever received the sweater? (4) wait until she goes back \nhome for a visit, and then impress Aunt Mary with how she \nremembered the sweater after all these years and was waiting \nto thank her in person? (5) telephone Aunt Mary long-dis­\ntance and after a half an hour of chit-chat (at considerable \ncost) to soften her up, thank her? or (6) give up any hope of \never being able to face Aunt Mary again because how can \nshe ever explain why she couldn't find five minutes to write \na quick note the week the sweater arrived? \nWhat Is the Price of Delay? \nMs. Davis's delay in thanking Aunt Mary cost her many \nminutes of anguish. She would have suffered less had she \nslowed down and made a deliberate effort to recall the conse­\nquences of her past delays: Her Aunt had felt slighted before \n",

It's not surprising that Ms. \nDavis hates writing thank-you notes! She starts worrying \nabout the letter whenever she has an odd moment. She con­\nstructs the note in her head while taking a shower and while \ntaking out the garbage, but this doesn't bring her any closer \nto getting the letter written. \nMs. Davis starts feeling terribly guilty—so guilty, in fact, \nthe thought of the letter makes her sick. In order to avoid \nthis, she now blocks out of her mind any thought of the un­\nwritten note. \nFinally one day the unwritten note comes back to haunt \nher, and Ms. Davis acknowledges to herself that it is Deci­\nsion Time. Should she: (1) write a ten-page letter bringing \nAunt Mary up-to-date on",

Should she: (1) write a ten-page letter bringing \nAunt Mary up-to-date on life with the Davis family for the \nlast two years, and off-handedly sneak in a thank-you for the \nsweater? (2) wait another nine months and if Aunt Mary \nsends another birthday present (hopefully she won't!) thank \nher for both presents at the same time? (3) pretend she \nnever received the sweater? (4) wait until she goes back \nhome for a visit, and then impress Aunt Mary with how she \nremembered the sweater after all these years and was waiting \nto thank her in person? (5) telephone Aunt Mary long-dis­\ntance and after a half an hour of chit-chat (at considerable \ncost) to soften her up, thank her? or (6) give up any hope of \never being able to face Aunt Mary again because how can \nshe ever explain why she couldn't find five minutes to write \na quick note the week the sweater arrived? \nWhat Is the Price of Delay? \nMs. Davis",

She knew from prior experience how each week of pro­\ncrastination in writing a thank-you note escalated both the \nsize of the task and the discomfort level. How much better to \nwrite the note now than to endure such suffering again. \nBefore you consider delaying in such situations, slow down. \nTake a minute or two to consider the consequences that will \nfollow. \nAcknowledge that if past experience and present resolve \nare any indication, this is not something that will go away. \nYou are going to do this task eventually. The question is not \n\"Will I do it?\" but \"When?\" Ask yourself, \"Since I am going \nto do it eventually, do I really want to pay the price of de­\nlay?\" \nWhat is this price you'll have to pay? While it's different in \nvarious situations, the following guidelines are generally true. \nFor one thing, if a task is not something that will go away, \nthe actual work required may increase as time passes (as \nwith the thank-you note). Also, it will keep haunting you un­\ntil you do it. Here are some other situations where procras­\ntination creates trouble and extra work. You can: \nput off filing your paperwork so long that every time you \nneed a piece of paper you have to hunt through a huge \"to \nbe filed\" stack, \ndelay changing your car's motor oil until you need a $375 \nengine repair two months after the manufacturer's guarantee \nexpires, \nput off sweeping crumbs from the back of the pantry so \nthat you come home one day to find your crumbs gone and \nthousands of ants in their place, \ndelay action of replacing the unreliable widget section until \nsuddenly you are swamped with customer complaints and \nmust spend more time answering complaints than fixing the \nwidget section would ever have taken—and you still have to \nfix the widget section. \nEven when the task seems to remain identical whether you \ndo it now or later, its impact on you can be substantially dif­\nferent \nSuppose you feel so tense and nervous about asking your \nboss for a raise that you put it off until tomorrow. Tomor­\nrow, when you think about it again, you feel every bit aa \nanxious, if not more so. And every time you think about it \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 137 \nyou not only remind yourself what a nasty scene you may \nprovoke by your request, but you summon up all the emo­\ntions associated with this nastiness. In other words, every \ntime you think about the task and put it off, you suffer some \nof the same pain as if you had actually done it \nYou still don't know whether you'll get a raise, so you'll \nhave to think about it further and again suffer pain. More­\nover, there is a tendency for your anxiety to increase each \ntime you think about it. Does it make sense to put off doing \nsomething because you feel tense and nervous about it—and \nthen feel tense and nervous anyway? \nNext time you're tempted to procrastinate on an unpleas­\nant A-l, slow down. Why suffer all the pain associated with \nthinking about it and get none of the benefits? You've sur­\nvived every nasty situation you've faced. Sometimes—be hon­\nest now—didn't you worry unnecessarily? Didn't some of \nthose experiences turn out to be tolerable and even occasion­\nally pleasant? And even when there was real discomfort \ndidn't it often stop quicker than you had imagined? \nConsider the Risks \nCan you really afford to risk delaying a large, important \nproject until the last minute? Suppose you aren't feeling well \nwhen the last minute comes? Or you face an unexpectedly \nlarge number of unavoidable interruptions? Or another crisis \ncomes up that must be dealt with immediately? Or the proj­\nect turns out to require more hours than you had originally \nestimated? When you delay a project until close to the dead­\nline there is always the risk that you'll run short of time and \nhave to submit inadequate work or miss the deadline. \nThe college student who assesses the risk of delay has to \ndecide whether his term paper is an A, B, or C priority. The \nstudent who is more interested in dates, sports, politics or \nrecreational reading might well give the term paper a C-prior-\nity until the last minute, but he pays the price when his pro­\nfessor gives the paper only a C-grade. \nMany people say, \"I deliberately put things off until the \nlast minute because I know I work best under pressure. If I \nwait until the deadline is really close, I'm more effective. I \n138 ALAN",

She knew from prior experience how each week of pro­\ncrastination in writing a thank-you note escalated both the \nsize of the task and the discomfort level. How much better to \nwrite the note now than to endure such suffering again. \nBefore you consider delaying in such situations, slow down. \nTake a minute or two to consider the consequences that will \nfollow. \nAcknowledge that if past experience and present resolve \nare any indication, this is not something that will go away. \nYou are going to do this task eventually. The question is not \n\"Will I do it?\" but \"When?\" Ask yourself, \"Since I am going \nto do it eventually, do I really want to pay the price of de­\nlay?\" \nWhat is this price you'll have to pay? While it's different in \nvarious situations, the following guidelines are generally true. \nFor one thing, if a task is not something that will go away, \nthe actual work required may increase as time passes (as \nwith the thank-you note). Also, it will keep haunting you un­\ntil you do it. Here are some other situations where procras­\ntination creates trouble and extra work. You can: \nput off filing your paperwork so long that every time you \nneed a piece of paper you have to hunt through a huge \"to \nbe filed\" stack, \ndelay changing your car's motor oil until you need a $375 \nengine repair two months after the manufacturer's guarantee \nexpires, \nput off sweeping crumbs from the back of the pantry so \nthat you come home one day to find your crumbs gone and \nthousands of ants in their place, \ndelay action of replacing the unreliable widget section until \nsuddenly you are swamped with customer complaints and \nmust spend more time answering complaints than fixing the \nwidget section would ever have taken—and you still have to \nfix the widget section. \nEven when the task seems to remain identical whether you \ndo it now or later, its impact on you can be substantially dif­\nferent \nSuppose you feel so tense and nervous about asking your \nboss for a raise that you put it off until tomorrow. Tomor­\nrow, when you think about it again, you feel every bit aa \nanxious, if not more so. And every time you think about it \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF",

And every time you think about it \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 137 \nyou not only remind yourself what a nasty scene you may \nprovoke by your request, but you summon up all the emo­\ntions associated with this nastiness. In other words, every \ntime you think about the task and put it off, you suffer some \nof the same pain as if you had actually done it \nYou still don't know whether you'll get a raise, so you'll \nhave to think about it further and again suffer pain. More­\nover, there is a tendency for your anxiety to increase each \ntime you think about it. Does it make sense to put off doing \nsomething because you feel tense and nervous about it—and \nthen feel tense and nervous anyway? \nNext time you're tempted to procrastinate on an unpleas­\nant A-l, slow down. Why suffer all the pain associated with \nthinking about it and get none of the benefits? You've sur­\nvived every nasty situation you've faced. Sometimes—be hon­\nest now—didn't you worry unnecessarily? Didn't some of \nthose experiences turn out to be tolerable and even occasion­\nally pleasant? And even when there was real discomfort \ndidn't it often stop quicker than you had imagined? \nConsider the Risks \nCan you really afford to risk delaying a large, important \nproject until the last minute? Suppose you aren't feeling well \nwhen the last minute comes? Or you face an unexpectedly \nlarge number of unavoidable interruptions? Or another crisis \ncomes up that must be dealt with immediately? Or the proj­\nect turns out to require more hours than you had originally \nestimated? When you delay a project until close to the dead­\nline there is always the risk that you'll run short of time and \nhave to submit inadequate work or miss the deadline. \nThe college student who assesses the risk of delay has to \ndecide whether his term paper is an A, B, or C priority. The \nstudent who is more interested in dates, sports, politics or \nrecreational reading might well give the term paper a C-prior-\nity until the last minute, but he pays the price when his pro­\nfessor gives the paper only",

In other words, every \ntime you think about the task and put it off, you suffer some \nof the same pain as if you had actually done it \nYou still don't know whether you'll get a raise, so you'll \nhave to think about it further and again suffer pain. More­\nover, there is a tendency for your anxiety to increase each \ntime you think about it. Does it make sense to put off doing \nsomething because you feel tense and nervous about it—and \nthen feel tense and nervous anyway? \nNext time you're tempted to procrastinate on an unpleas­\nant A-l, slow down. Why suffer all the pain associated with \nthinking about it and get none of the benefits? You've sur­\nvived every nasty situation you've faced",

If I \nwait until the deadline is really close, I'm more effective. I \n138 ALAN LAKEIN \nwaste less time, I get better ideas. I don't lose by delay; I \ngain!** \nIf you've made a clear-headed assessment of your work \nhabits and are convinced that such is the case, I say, fine! \nMany people do work best under pressure. For others, too \nmuch pressure can be devastating. Whether you're a college \nstudent putting off a term paper until the last minute, a \nhomemaker putting off packing valuable china and stemware \nfor the move to the new house, or an executive putting off \npreparing your fall sales campaign, you must assess your own \nwork habits and determine how you function best. \nDo you really work well under pressure? Consider the col­\nlege student with his term-paper problem. There are a num­\nber of reasons why the quality of his work is not as likely to \nbe as high as if he had more time. Valuable reference mate­\nrial or interviews may be left out because of time pressures. \nIdeas that require investigation cannot be explored when \nthere's no time to investigate. A last-minute effort means that \naccuracy may have to be dispensed with. No rewriting is pos­\nsible and so the prose style will suffer. \nAsk yourself if you perhaps spend more time by delaying \nuntil the last minute? Working overtime on a crash program \nleads to physical and mental fatigue. Thinking becomes fuzzy. \nHours may be lost solving a problem that a clear mind could \npenetrate in minutes. \nEmotions may eat up extra time, too. It takes time to \nworry about whether you're ever going to start the project; \nwhether your work is going to be good enough; whether \nyou're going to make the deadline. Do you feel anger at \nyourself for putting yourself in such a position? Regret at not \nbeing able to go to a show tonight? Disappointment that \nyou're really not giving yourself a chance to show your abil­\nity to do good work under more favorable circumstances? \nThe Drawbacks of Pressure \nThe need to expedite routine parts of a project when every \nminute counts often forces you to do work yourself which \ncould have been done by others had you budgeted your time \nbetter. You'll have.to do the typing, photocopying, collating, \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 139 \nstapling, and other clerical work, because there's no secretary \nat 3 A.M. to help you. \nBesides, do you like working well under pressure? Or do \nyou feel a slave to deadlines? Do you experience last-minute \npanic about whether or not you will finish an important proj­\nect on time? Do you wonder if there isn't some other way— \na relaxed, in-control-of-the-situation approach? \nDo you find that you behave badly toward other people \nwhen you're under pressure? Do you make other people mis­\nerable by your demands for priority of your work over \ntheirs? Remember, people may not think your project is the \nmost important \nIf your backlog and new demands continually create pres­\nsure without letup and you don't like it perhaps you're in the \nwrong job. But if the pressure is self-inflicted by your own \nperpetual procrastination, then maybe you can do something \nabout it \nDo you work well only under pressure? Maybe you thrive \non the feeling of exhilaration that comes from the total in­\nvolvement demanded in meeting a last-minute deadline. But \nwhat happens when the pressure is off? Do you find the time \nbetween deadlines woefully flat and stale? Puttering around, \nshuffling papers, doing trivia and giving the pressure a chance \nto build up isn't much fun. True, you can use the time be­\ntween deadlines to goof off, recover from the last crisis, \nprepare yourself for the next crisis—which is all to the good. \nBut if you feel you're fully alive only when under great pres­\nsure, and feel let down in the in-between periods, then you \nmay want to try some changes. Ideally, you want to be flex­\nible enough to make good use of your time whatever the situ-\nation. \nHere's a suggestion to help you avoid deadline mania: \nDon't wait quite so long before plunging in. Give yourself \na little more lead time before the deadline. Try to start a \nlittle sooner, even though the pressure is not full-blown. As \nyou learn to decrease the amount of pressure you need to \nwork well, I think you'll find that you're increasing",

I don't lose by delay; I \ngain!** \nIf you've made a clear-headed assessment of your work \nhabits and are convinced that such is the case, I say, fine! \nMany people do work best under pressure. For others, too \nmuch pressure can be devastating. Whether you're a college \nstudent putting off a term paper until the last minute, a \nhomemaker putting off packing valuable china and stemware \nfor the move to the new house, or an executive putting off \npreparing your fall sales campaign, you must assess your own \nwork habits and determine how you function best. \nDo you really work well under pressure? Consider the col­\nlege student with his term-paper problem. There are a num­\nber of reasons why the quality of his work is not as likely to \nbe as high as if he had more time. Valuable reference mate­\nrial or interviews may be left out because of time pressures. \nIdeas that require investigation cannot be explored when \nthere's no time to investigate. A last-minute effort means that \naccuracy may have to be dispensed with. No rewriting is pos­\nsible and so the prose style will suffer. \nAsk yourself if you perhaps spend more time by delaying \nuntil the last minute? Working overtime on a crash program \nleads to physical and mental fatigue. Thinking becomes fuzzy. \nHours may be lost solving a problem that a clear mind could \npenetrate in minutes. \nEmotions may eat up extra time, too. It takes time to \nworry about whether you're ever going to start the project; \nwhether your work is going to be good enough; whether \nyou're going to make the deadline. Do you feel anger at \nyourself for putting yourself in such a position? Regret at not \nbeing able to go to a show tonight? Disappointment that \nyou're really not giving yourself a chance to show your abil­\nity to do good work under more favorable circumstances? \nThe Drawbacks of Pressure \nThe need to expedite routine parts of a project when every \nminute counts often forces you to do work yourself which \ncould have been done by",

You'll have.to do the typing, photocopying, collating, \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 139 \nstapling, and other clerical work, because there's no secretary \nat 3 A.M. to help you. \nBesides, do you like working well under pressure? Or do \nyou feel a slave to deadlines? Do you experience last-minute \npanic about whether or not you will finish an important proj­\nect on time? Do you wonder if there isn't some other way— \na relaxed, in-control-of-the-situation approach? \nDo you find that you behave badly toward other people \nwhen you're under pressure? Do you make other people mis­\nerable by your demands for priority of your work over \ntheirs? Remember, people may not think your project is the \nmost important \nIf your backlog and new demands continually create pres­\nsure without letup and you don't like it perhaps you're in the \nwrong job. But if the pressure is self-inflicted by your own \nperpetual procrastination, then maybe you can do something \nabout it \nDo you work well only under pressure? Maybe you thrive \non the feeling of exhilaration that comes from the total in­\nvolvement demanded in meeting a last-minute deadline. But \nwhat happens when the pressure is off? Do you find the time \nbetween deadlines woefully flat and stale? Puttering around, \nshuffling papers, doing trivia and giving the pressure a chance \nto build up isn't much fun. True, you can use the time be­\ntween deadlines to goof off, recover from the last crisis, \nprepare yourself for the next crisis—which is all to the good. \nBut if you feel you're fully alive only when under great pres­\nsure, and feel let down in the in-between periods, then you \nmay want to try some changes. Ideally, you want to be flex­\nible enough to make good use of your time whatever the situ-\nation. \nHere's a suggestion to help you avoid deadline mania: \nDon't wait quite so long before plunging in. Give yourself \na little more",

    "text": " lead time before the deadline. Try to start a \nlittle sooner, even though the pressure is not full-blown. As \nyou learn to decrease the amount of pressure you need to \nwork well, I think you'll find that you're increasing your \nwillpower. You'll find you've gained a new sense of freedom \nand self-confidence. You'll feel more relaxed and in control \nof your time (and your life). \n20. LEARN TO STRESS THE BENEFITS \nTM NOW GOING to describe a technicrae called \"Stress the \nBenefits\" to help you muster enthusiasm at Decision Time for \nany unappetizing A-l. \nConsider Mr. O'Henry, who had an idea that he thought \nwould save his organization several thousand dollars a year. \nNormally he would have submitted his idea immediately to \nhis company's suggestion system. But this time he delayed \nsubmitting his proposal, because he knew that, if adopted, it \nmight mean cutting back on the work assigned to one of his \nco-workers. \nThe improvement Mr. O'Henry envisioned was tricky. \nThere was a certain amount of risk involved. His supervisor \nhad already given his opinion on the suggestion: \"We tried \nthat nine years ago. It didn't work then and it wont work \nnow.\" \nThe risk of failure, the possible resentment of his co­\nworker, and the hassle with his supervisor had kept him from \nformally presenting his suggestion until now. Still, Mr. \nO'Henry was convinced that, everything considered, submit­\nting his proposal was the A-l. \nHe managed finally to sell himself on submitting the pro­\nposal by listing all the benefits he could expect. The benefits \nwere of two types: (1) pluses that would start when the A-l \nwas done and (2) minuses that would stop when the A-l was \ndone. \nThe pluses included the following: a cash bonus of 20 per­\ncent of the first year's savings (at least $1,250), self-satisfac­\ntion for a well done, and recognition from the management \n(leading to promotion, more interesting and enjoyable work, \nand a higher salary). \nThe minuses that would stop when the A-l was done in­\ncluded: worrying every night about whether to submit the \nsuggestion form (worry could lead to ulcers, spending time in \n140 \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 141 \nhospital, using savings to pay hospital bills, etc.), avoiding his \nco-worker because of ambivalent feelings toward him, hating \nhis supervisor for blocking his progress in the company. \nOnce he started to Stress the Benefits, the A-l began to \nlook so attractive that he was able to put possible drawbacks \nout of his mind, and go eagerly on with the suggestion form. \nHow to Reward Yourself \nIt's particularly valuable to Stress the Benefits as you plow \nthrough a long or complex job. Sometimes it's even necessary \nto exaggerate (balloon) the benefits in the middle of a hard \nA-l. \nIf you've already considered all the benefits you'll reap \nfrom the A-l and still find yourself having a hard time ac­\ncomplishing it, then you may have to try adding outside ben­\nefits. The new benefits are like a rider to a Congressional bill \nthat contains \"sweeteners\" to induce wavering Congressmen \nto vote for the bill. \nSuppose you have to go on a business trip. It's particularly \nunappealing to you. You may be able to make it more palat­\nable by tacking a few days on the end of your trip to take \nyour wife to that ski resort you've been thinking of visiting. \nYou've gone beyond stressing the normal benefits (more \nmoney, possible promotion, etc.). You've added a \"rider\" to \ninspire you to do your A-l—take that very important busi­\nness trip. \nYou can give yourself a reward for working on a task as a \nway to coax yourself along. Plan to work until eleven o'clock \nand then take a break to read the news magazine you've been \nwaiting to look at—or sleep late the next morning. \nGive yourself a reward when you reach various milestones \nalong the way of a larger project: when all the data for a \nsurvey comes; after you've interviewed six people to replace \nyour assistant; after you've got a first draft of the plans for \nthe new plant. If you work on the annual report today, \nyou're entitled to go out for a drink after work. These are all \nways of rewarding yourself. \nRewards on final completion are important too. After I \nfinish writing this book I'll take a vacation-\nIt also helps to relate an immediate reward to your Life-\n142 ALAN LAKE IN",

As \nyou learn to decrease the amount of pressure you need to \nwork well, I think you'll find that you're increasing your \nwillpower. You'll find you've gained a new sense of freedom \nand self-confidence. You'll feel more relaxed and in control \nof your time (and your life). \n20. LEARN TO STRESS THE BENEFITS \nTM NOW GOING to describe a technicrae called \"Stress the \nBenefits\" to help you muster enthusiasm at Decision Time for \nany unappetizing A-l. \nConsider Mr. O'Henry, who had an idea that he thought \nwould save his organization several thousand dollars a year. \nNormally he would have submitted his idea immediately to \nhis company's suggestion system. But this time he delayed \nsubmitting his proposal, because he knew that, if adopted, it \nmight mean cutting back on the work assigned to one of his \nco-workers. \nThe improvement Mr. O'Henry envisioned was tricky. \nThere was a certain amount of risk involved. His supervisor \nhad already given his opinion on the suggestion: \"We tried \nthat nine years ago. It didn't work then and it wont work \nnow.\" \nThe risk of failure, the possible resentment of his co­\nworker, and the hassle with his supervisor had kept him from \nformally presenting his suggestion until now. Still, Mr. \nO'Henry was convinced that, everything considered, submit­\nting his proposal was the A-l. \nHe managed finally to sell himself on submitting the pro­\nposal by listing all the benefits he could expect. The benefits \nwere of two types: (1) pluses that would start when the A-l \nwas done and (2) minuses that would stop when the A-l was \ndone. \nThe pluses included the following: a cash bonus of 20 per­\ncent of the first year's savings (at least $1,250), self-satisfac­\ntion for a well done, and recognition from the management \n(leading to promotion, more interesting and enjoyable work, \nand a higher salary). \nThe minuses that would stop when the A-l was done in­\ncluded: worrying every night about whether to submit the \nsuggestion form (worry could lead to ulcers, spending time in \n140 \nHOW TO GET",

Sometimes it's even necessary \nto exaggerate (balloon) the benefits in the middle of a hard \nA-l. \nIf you've already considered all the benefits you'll reap \nfrom the A-l and still find yourself having a hard time ac­\ncomplishing it, then you may have to try adding outside ben­\nefits. The new benefits are like a rider to a Congressional bill \nthat contains \"sweeteners\" to induce wavering Congressmen \nto vote for the bill. \nSuppose you have to go on a business trip. It's particularly \nunappealing to you. You may be able to make it more palat­\nable by tacking a few days on the end of your trip to take \nyour wife to that ski resort you've been thinking of visiting. \nYou've gone beyond stressing the normal benefits (more \nmoney, possible promotion, etc.). You've added a \"rider\" to \ninspire you to do your A-l—take that very important busi­\nness trip. \nYou can give yourself a reward for working on a task as a \nway to coax yourself along. Plan to work until eleven o'clock \nand then take a break to read the news magazine you've been \nwaiting to look at—or sleep late the next morning. \nGive yourself a reward when you reach various milestones \nalong the way of a larger project: when all the data for a \nsurvey comes; after you've interviewed six people to replace \nyour assistant; after you've got a first draft of the plans for \nthe new plant. If you work on the annual report today, \nyou're entitled to go out for a drink after work.",

    "text": " These are all \nways of rewarding yourself. \nRewards on final completion are important too. After I \nfinish writing this book I'll take a vacation-\nIt also helps to relate an immediate reward to your Life-\n142 ALAN LAKE IN \ntime Goals. You can say, \"Well, now, if I do this I'm going \nto keep my job, and I'm going to get promoted.\" Then you \ncan build up the reward in your mind. If you have a good set \nof Lifetime Goals you can probably think of many more con­\nnections between doing this A-l and achieving some Lifetime \nGoals. Again, you're Stressing the Benefits. \nAnother way of keeping the value of the task in front of \nyou is to give yourself a little taste in advance of what will \nhappen if you do keep working on the A-l. Remember that \nvacation I have promised myself for when I finish my book? \nWell, long before I actually finish TU go down to our travel \nagent and make the airline, hotel, and car-rental reservations. \nThen I'll go back and keep on writing. I get further along on \nmy A-l by Stressing the Benefits. \nAnother way to get yourself to do unpleasant A-l's is to \nturn the whole task into a game. Let's say painting your liv­\ning room took you and your wife ten hours four years ago. \nHave you improved with age? See if you can shave some \ntime off that ten hours. If you're a secretary with a particular \nreport to be done every so often, see if you can type it \nflawlessly this time. Keep a little piece of paper noting how \nmany errors you made last time and see if you can beat that \n. score. \nIf it's a rather routine job, see how much of it you can \nknock off in fifteen minutes, or how nonchalant you can be \nwhile doing it. Anything that will help you get the task done \nis valuable. It helps you complete the task by varying the \nincentive, and even artificial incentives can help. Stress the \nBenefits and move closer to getting the A-l done. \n21. HOW TO GET BACK AFTER \nYOU'VE ESCAPED \nIN all my discussion of procrastination I've assumed that, \nonce you've done a good job of planning, you're clear in your \nown mind about what your A-l is. You may go right ahead \nand do it or you may not. My clients have found that the \ntechniques I've explained in the last several chapters will \nsignificantly increase the will to \"do it now\" and throttle \ndown procrastination. \nBut still, everyone procrastinates on occasion. So now I'd \nlike to show you what is really happening when you don't do \nthe A-l, when you deliberately or not-so-deliberately decide \nto put off the really important activity. \nIf you're not doing the A-l, you're doing something else \ninstead. This \"something else,\" whatever its intrinsic value \n(which may be very high), is in part appealing because it is \nan Escape from doing or thinking about the A-l. \nEveryone has favorite Escapes. Escapes can be A's, B's, \nC's, or watching the girls go by. If you're at work, an Escape \ngenerally needs to be something that gives others the impres­\nsion that you're busy and productive. In a private office or at \nhome you have somewhat more leeway. You can even take a \nnap. \nSeven Common Mistakes \nHere is a run-down of some of the most common Escapes. \nAs you read through them, ask yourself how many of these \nescape routes you use when running away from the A-l. \nIndulging yourself. Doing something you really enjoy. \nBuying a new hat or tie or book. Taking the rest of the day \noff to play golf. Getting a suntan. Going to the movies. \nSleeping. Taking a bath or shower and leisurely grooming \nyourself. \n143 \n144 ALAN LAKE IN \nSocializing. Visiting with others. Lingering on the tele­\nphone. Renewing an acquaintance with an old friend. Making \nsmall talk every chance you get. \nReading. Catching up on the backlog of unread periodicals \nstacked on the side table. Skimming through material previ­\nously relegated to a bottom drawer as not really worth read­\ning. Spending two hours on The Wall Street Journal, or \ntrying to make a dent in your pile of unread copies of the \nSunday New York Times or Book-of-the-Month Club selec­\ntions. \nDoing it yourself. Baking your own bread. Spending an \nhour taking notes on a reference book rather than photo­\ncopying the three essential pages. Adding a long",

    "text": " These are all \nways of rewarding yourself. \nRewards on final completion are important too. After I \nfinish writing this book I'll take a vacation-\nIt also helps to relate an immediate reward to your Life-\n142 ALAN LAKE IN \ntime Goals. You can say, \"Well, now, if I do this I'm going \nto keep my job, and I'm going to get promoted.\" Then you \ncan build up the reward in your mind. If you have a good set \nof Lifetime Goals you can probably think of many more con­\nnections between doing this A-l and achieving some Lifetime \nGoals. Again, you're Stressing the Benefits. \nAnother way of keeping the value of the task in front of \nyou is to give yourself a little taste in advance of what will \nhappen if you do keep working on the A-l. Remember that \nvacation I have promised myself for when I finish my book? \nWell, long before I actually finish TU go down to our travel \nagent and make the airline, hotel, and car-rental reservations. \nThen I'll go back and keep on writing. I get further along on \nmy A-l by Stressing the Benefits. \nAnother way to get yourself to do unpleasant A-l's is to \nturn the whole task into a game. Let's say painting your liv­\ning room took you and your wife ten hours four years ago. \nHave you improved with age? See if you can shave some \ntime off that ten hours. If you're a secretary with a particular \nreport to be done every so often, see if you can type it \nflawlessly this time. Keep a little piece of paper noting how \nmany errors you made last time and see if you can beat that \n. score. \nIf it's a rather routine job, see how much of it you can \nknock off in fifteen minutes, or how nonchalant you can be \nwhile doing it.

You may go right ahead \nand do it or you may not. My clients have found that the \ntechniques I've explained in the last several chapters will \nsignificantly increase the will to \"do it now\" and throttle \ndown procrastination. \nBut still, everyone procrastinates on occasion. So now I'd \nlike to show you what is really happening when you don't do \nthe A-l, when you deliberately or not-so-deliberately decide \nto put off the really important activity. \nIf you're not doing the A-l, you're doing something else \ninstead. This \"something else,\" whatever its intrinsic value \n(which may be very high), is in part appealing because it is \nan Escape from doing or thinking about the A-l. \nEveryone has favorite Escapes. Escapes can be A's, B's, \nC's, or watching the girls go by. If you're at work, an Escape \ngenerally needs to be something that gives others the impres­\nsion that you're busy and productive. In a private office or at \nhome you have somewhat more leeway. You can even take a \nnap. \nSeven Common Mistakes \nHere is a run-down of some of the most common Escapes. \nAs you read through them, ask yourself how many of these \nescape routes you use when running away from the A-l. \nIndulging yourself. Doing something you really enjoy. \nBuying a new hat or tie or book. Taking the rest of the day \noff to play golf. Getting a suntan. Going to the movies. \nSleeping. Taking a bath or shower and leisurely grooming \nyourself. \n143 \n144 ALAN LAKE IN \nSocializing. Visiting with others. Lingering on the tele­\nphone. Renewing an acquaintance with an old friend. Making \nsmall talk every chance you get. \nReading. Catching up on the backlog of unread periodicals \nstacked on the side table. Skimming through material previ­\nously relegated to a bottom drawer as not really worth read­\ning. Spending two hours on The Wall Street Journal, or \ntrying to make a dent in your pile of unread copies of the \nSunday New York Times",

Spending an \nhour taking notes on a reference book rather than photo­\ncopying the three essential pages. Adding a long string of \nnumbers by hand rather than walking over to the adding \nmachine. Doing something that could be delegated. Spending \nyour time solving other people's problems. Delving into as­\npects of the job that don't really concern you. \nOverdoing it. Supervising employees so closely that they \ncan't get their work done. Keeping every visitor an extra fif­\nteen minutes while you talk about your mimosa, butterfly col­\nlection, arthritis, or lack of time. Being so diligent in giving \nyour boss progress reports that you have little time to make \nprogress. Rearranging your desk, inside and out, to be the \nvery model of neatness and efficiency. \nRunning away. If you're in headquarters, organizing a field \ntrip. If in the field, going to headquarters. Expediting some­\nthing that doesn't need it: hand-carrying a memo to another \nbranch office; paying your telephone bill in person. Taking a \nlong coffee break; extending your lunch hour; taking time for \na cocktail or shopping. \nDaydreaming. Planning how you're going to spend your \nweekend. Worrying about all the things left undone at work. \nWondering how you're going to spend the extra money from \nyour hoped-for promotion. Recalling what a witty remark \nyou made at a party yesterday. \nNo doubt you can add to this list some of your own special \nfavorites. Please remember, I'm not saying that there is any­\nthing wrong with indulging yourself, reading, socializing, day­\ndreaming. Quite the contrary; much of the fun in life comes \nfrom such things. Indeed, that is precisely why they are so \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LD7E 145 \nappealing. The problem is you're trained to these escapes \nwhen you should be doing the A-l. \nOther Escapes are more subtle and less readily recognized \nas such. Perhaps you dabble around the periphery of the A-l, \nspending too much time on irrelevant details rather than \ngoing to the heart of the matter. Or as Ms. Gill did with her \nneedlepoint project, you spend so much time getting ready to \nbegin the A-l that you have no time left to do it. \nFinally, there are what might be called the Emotional Es­\ncapes: feeling guilty, getting angry, worrying. Indulging in \nsuch feelings is a very common way of escaping from the A-\n1. To ask yourself whether perhaps you took the wrong job, \nmarried the wrong spouse, or bought the wrong house may \nwell be useful. But if you wallow in such thoughts, ifs time \nto ask Lakein's Question. \nAdmit When You're Wasting Time \nSome Escapes are undoubtedly worth doing and are excel­\nlent uses of time: getting organized, making lists, improving \nmorale, socializing, taking the day off, doing the A-2 or A-3, \ncatching up on reading. Therefore, it is easy to tell yourself \nyou're really making good use of your time, even though you \nare not doing the A-l. And perhaps you are. But you're not \nmaking the best use of your time. \nThe best use of your time—as you've already decided—is \nto do the A-l. Anything else is a comparative waste of time. \nConsider one of my clients, a research scientist. He kept \nprocrastinating on a difficult research study that had a very \nhigh priority. Despite his efforts to get involved and to con­\nvince himself how important it was, he kept stalling. At my \nsuggestion, he began to take a careful look at each Decision \nTime when he chose to avoid the A-l and turned to some­\nthing else. \nAt first, he felt like a helpless observer. It seemed as if the \nprocrastination process was operating in spite of anything he \ncould do. Rather than be discouraged at this point, he con­\nsoled himself with the knowledge that he was trying to under­\nstand the dynamics of the process, which is the first step \ntoward controlling it. \nAfter several days of closely watching his actions at Deci-\n146 ALAN LAKEIN \nsion Time, he found certain patterns emerging. The thought \nof doing the A-l was always followed immediately by feel­\nings of inadequacy and tension. Most of the time he then \nquickly turned to making improvements on an old and famil­\niar research problem. He would talk to someone about some \naspect of this other study, or rethink and rewrite portions \nthat needed",

Or as Ms. Gill did with her \nneedlepoint project, you spend so much time getting ready to \nbegin the A-l that you have no time left to do it. \nFinally, there are what might be called the Emotional Es­\ncapes: feeling guilty, getting angry, worrying. Indulging in \nsuch feelings is a very common way of escaping from the A-\n1. To ask yourself whether perhaps you took the wrong job, \nmarried the wrong spouse, or bought the wrong house may \nwell be useful. But if you wallow in such thoughts, ifs time \nto ask Lakein's Question. \nAdmit When You're Wasting Time \nSome Escapes are undoubtedly worth doing and are excel­\nlent uses of time: getting organized, making lists, improving \nmorale, socializing, taking the day off, doing the A-2 or A-3, \ncatching up on reading. Therefore, it is easy to tell yourself \nyou're really making good use of your time, even though you \nare not doing the A-l. And perhaps you are. But you're not \nmaking the best use of your time. \nThe best use of your time—as you've already decided—is \nto do the A-l. Anything else is a comparative waste of time. \nConsider one of my clients, a research scientist. He kept \nprocrastinating on a difficult research study that had a very \nhigh priority. Despite his efforts to get involved and to con­\nvince himself how important it was, he kept stalling. At my \nsuggestion, he began to take a careful look at each Decision \nTime when he chose to avoid the A-l and turned to some­\nthing else. \nAt first, he felt like a helpless observer. It seemed as if the \nprocrastination process was operating in spite of anything he \ncould do. Rather than be discouraged at this point, he con­\nsoled himself with the knowledge that he was trying to under­\nstand the dynamics of the process, which is the first step \ntoward controlling it. \nAfter several days of closely watching his actions at Deci-\n146 ALAN LAKEIN \nsion Time, he found certain patterns emerging.

    "text": " around the periphery of the A-l, \nspending too much time on irrelevant details rather than \ngoing to the heart of the matter. Or as Ms. Gill did with her \nneedlepoint project, you spend so much time getting ready to \nbegin the A-l that you have no time left to do it. \nFinally, there are what might be called the Emotional Es­\ncapes: feeling guilty, getting angry, worrying. Indulging in \nsuch feelings is a very common way of escaping from the A-\n1. To ask yourself whether perhaps you took the wrong job, \nmarried the wrong spouse, or bought the wrong house may \nwell be useful. But if you wallow in such thoughts, ifs time \nto ask Lakein's Question. \nAdmit When You're Wasting Time \nSome Escapes are undoubtedly worth doing and are excel­\nlent uses of time: getting organized, making lists, improving \nmorale, socializing, taking the day off, doing the A-2 or A-3, \ncatching up on reading. Therefore, it is easy to tell yourself \nyou're really making good use of your time, even though you \nare not doing the A-l. And perhaps you are.",

But you're not \nmaking the best use of your time. \nThe best use of your time—as you've already decided—is \nto do the A-l. Anything else is a comparative waste of time. \nConsider one of my clients, a research scientist. He kept \nprocrastinating on a difficult research study that had a very \nhigh priority. Despite his efforts to get involved and to con­\nvince himself how important it was, he kept stalling. At my \nsuggestion, he began to take a careful look at each Decision \nTime when he chose to avoid the A-l and turned to some­\nthing else. \nAt first, he felt like a helpless observer. It seemed as if the \nprocrastination process was operating in spite of anything he \ncould do. Rather than be discouraged at this point, he con­\nsoled himself with the knowledge that he was trying to under­\nstand the dynamics of the process, which is the first step \ntoward controlling it.",

He would talk to someone about some \naspect of this other study, or rethink and rewrite portions \nthat needed polishing. He felt completely on top of the situa­\ntion. He was not doing the A-l, but he was doing something \nimportant and productive. \nIn the back of his mind, however, was the nagging thought \nthat he was rationalizing. He was not perfecting the old re­\nport because it was essential (it was worth doing, but not \nnow). He was doing it because it provided an easy Escape \nfrom the A-l. \nOn my recommendation, every time he found himself \nworking on the old project he repeated silently over and over \nto himself, *Tm wasting my time.\" During the next week or \nso he admitted to himself dozens of times \"I'm wasting my \ntime.\" \nAt first, saying this didn't stop him from turning to an Es­\ncape. Then the words began to make a difference. He ac­\nknowledged that he really was wasting his time. The benefits \nhe before associated with doing the Escape tasks had now \nlost much of their appeal. \nAs he realized more and more that he was wasting his \nown time, the tide began to change. Instead of letting the \nprocrastination process run him, he told himself that he \ndidn't have to waste his time. lust as he had chosen to do Es­\ncapes, he could choose to do the A-l. It really was a black \nand white choice—Escape vs. the A-l. As he became able to \nsee his problem in these terms he began to reject Escape \nand zeroed in on the A-l with increasing frequency. \nThe real payoff came when, several months later, a new \nand even more difficult research study was offered to him. \nHaving learned how his Escape mechanism worked, he was \nable to stop procrastinating and get involved in the new \nproject almost immediately. \nFve found that saying over and over *Tm wasting my \ntime\" works very well for women who choose ever-present \nroutine household chores over some challenging project they \nhave included in their Lifetime Goals Statement. If a woman \nreally wants to play the piano, every time she dusts the piano \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 147 \nshe should admit to herself, \"I am wasting my tune.\" If you \nuse the \"I'm wasting my time\" warning signal, you will find it \nincreasingly difficult to rationalize detours. Above all, you'll \naccept that it's you who is in control and makes the choices. \nEven when you achieve a high level of control, so that \nyour chances of choosing the A-l at Decision Time are good, \nyou won't always succeed. But if you can recognize when you \nare wasting your time, you'll definitely increase your chances \nfurther. \nHow to Cut Off Your Escape Routes \nAnother way to make sure you'll choose the A-l at Deci­\nsion Time is to cut off all your Escape routes. The principle \nis simple and is often used by people who are trying to lose \nweight or stop smoking. If you keep all candy or cigarettes \nout of the house, you make it that much harder to give in \nto the craving for them. Every time you crave candy or a \ncigarette after dinner, you have to make a special trip to the \nstore. Your reluctance to bundle up to go out in the cold \nmay exceed your longing for candy or a cigarette. \nShould you perhaps cancel the subscription to the mediocre \nmagazine you always turn to as an Escape from the A-l? If \nyou can't bring yourself to that, how about hiding it in a \ndrawer? At least then it won't have as much chance of dis­\ntracting you as when it's sitting on your desk. \nIf you're a housewife and your mornings are full of A's \nthat never seem to get done, then tactfully avoid your cof­\nfee-mate across the court. Sure, it's great fun talking to her \nbut this delightful Escape prevents you from accomplishing \nthe A-l. \nPerhaps your downfall is the two-martini lunch that ren­\nders you useless for the balance of the afternoon. If the most \nimportant thing you can do is have lunch and a few drinks \nwhile you regale an important client then by all means do it; \nit's your A-l. But if it's really an Escape from something im­\nportant you have to do this afternoon, then it might be a \ngood idea to think twice. As a compromise, why not go to \nlunch with a teetotaler? That way you can still enjoy lunch. \nYou'll probably",

He would talk to someone about some \naspect of this other study, or rethink and rewrite portions \nthat needed polishing. He felt completely on top of the situa­\ntion. He was not doing the A-l, but he was doing something \nimportant and productive. \nIn the back of his mind, however, was the nagging thought \nthat he was rationalizing. He was not perfecting the old re­\nport because it was essential (it was worth doing, but not \nnow). He was doing it because it provided an easy Escape \nfrom the A-l. \nOn my recommendation, every time he found himself \nworking on the old project he repeated silently over and over \nto himself, *Tm wasting my time.\" During the next week or \nso he admitted to himself dozens of times \"I'm wasting my \ntime.\" \nAt first, saying this didn't stop him from turning to an Es­\ncape. Then the words began to make a difference. He ac­\nknowledged that he really was wasting his time. The benefits \nhe before associated with doing the Escape tasks had now \nlost much of their appeal. \nAs he realized more and more that he was wasting his \nown time, the tide began to change. Instead of letting the \nprocrastination process run him, he told himself that he \ndidn't have to waste his time. lust as he had chosen to do Es­\ncapes, he could choose to do the A-l. It really was a black \nand white choice—Escape vs. the A-l. As he became able to \nsee his problem in these terms he began to reject Escape \nand zeroed in on the A-l with increasing frequency. \nThe real payoff came when, several months later, a new \nand even more difficult research study was offered to him. \nHaving learned how his Escape mechanism worked, he was \nable to stop procrastinating and get involved in the new \nproject almost immediately. \nFve found that saying over and over *Tm wasting my \ntime\" works very well for women who choose ever-present \nroutine household chores over some challenging project they \nhave included in their Lifetime Goals Statement.

The benefits \nhe before associated with doing the Escape tasks had now \nlost much of their appeal. \nAs he realized more and more that he was wasting his \nown time, the tide began to change. Instead of letting the \nprocrastination process run him, he told himself that he \ndidn't have to waste his time. lust as he had chosen to do Es­\ncapes, he could choose to do the A-l. It really was a black \nand white choice—Escape vs. the A-l. As he became able to \nsee his problem in these terms he began to reject Escape \nand zeroed in on the A-l with increasing frequency. \nThe real payoff came when, several months later, a new \nand even more difficult research study was offered to him. \nHaving learned how his Escape mechanism worked, he was \nable to stop procrastinating and get involved in the new \nproject almost immediately. \nFve found that saying over and over *Tm wasting my \ntime\" works very well for women who choose ever-present \nroutine",

If a woman \nreally wants to play the piano, every time she dusts the piano \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 147 \nshe should admit to herself, \"I am wasting my tune.\" If you \nuse the \"I'm wasting my time\" warning signal, you will find it \nincreasingly difficult to rationalize detours. Above all, you'll \naccept that it's you who is in control and makes the choices. \nEven when you achieve a high level of control, so that \nyour chances of choosing the A-l at Decision Time are good, \nyou won't always succeed. But if you can recognize when you \nare wasting your time, you'll definitely increase your chances \nfurther. \nHow to Cut Off Your Escape Routes \nAnother way to make sure you'll choose the A-l at Deci­\nsion Time is to cut off all your Escape routes. The principle \nis simple and is often used by people who are trying to lose \nweight or stop smoking. If you keep all candy or cigarettes \nout of the house, you make it that much harder to give in \nto the craving for them. Every time you crave candy or a \ncigarette after dinner, you have to make a special trip to the \nstore. Your reluctance to bundle up to go out in the cold \nmay exceed your longing for candy or a cigarette. \nShould you perhaps cancel the subscription to the mediocre \nmagazine you always turn to as an Escape from the A-l? If \nyou can't bring yourself to that, how about hiding it in a \ndrawer? At least then it won't have as much chance of dis­\ntracting you as when it's sitting on your desk. \nIf you're a housewife and your mornings are full of A's \nthat never seem to get done, then tactfully avoid your cof­\nfee-mate across the court. Sure, it's great fun talking to her \nbut this delightful Escape prevents you from accomplishing \nthe A-l. \nPerhaps your downfall is the two-martini lunch that ren­\nders you useless for the balance of the afternoon. If the most \nimportant thing you can do is have lunch and a few drinks \nwhile you regale an important client then by all means do it; \nit's your A-l. But if it's really an Escape from something im­\nport",

If you keep all candy or cigarettes \nout of the house, you make it that much harder to give in \nto the craving for them. Every time you crave candy or a \ncigarette after dinner, you have to make a special trip to the \nstore. Your reluctance to bundle up to go out in the cold \nmay exceed your longing for candy or a cigarette. \nShould you perhaps cancel the subscription to the mediocre \nmagazine you always turn to as an Escape from the A-l? If \nyou can't bring yourself to that, how about hiding it in a \ndrawer? At least then it won't have as much chance of dis­\ntracting you as when it's sitting on your desk. \nIf you're a housewife and your mornings are full of A's \nthat never seem to get done, then tactfully avoid your cof­\nfee-mate across the court. Sure, it's great fun talking to her \nbut this delightful Escape prevents you from accomplishing \nthe A-l. \nPerhaps your downfall is the two-martini lunch that ren­\nders you useless for the balance of the afternoon.

That way you can still enjoy lunch. \nYou'll probably moderate your alcoholic intake, allowing you \nto go after that A-l this afternoon. \n148 ALAN LAKEIN \nIf your Escape is going to the supermarket three times a \nweek, make it a rule that you'll go only once. To make sure \nthat you really won't need to go, do something concrete \nabout those meal-planning, stocking and freezing ideas you've \nbeen contemplating for years. If you forget something or run \nout, try to make do. \nThe Great Escape for nearly everybody is television. Lib­\nerate yourself! Give your set away and then stalk your A-ll \nOne final suggestion along these lines: You might want to \ngive your secretary a list of your favorite Escapes. lust the \nfact that you know she has the list may prevent you from \nutilizing these dodges except in the most severe cases. \nYon Can Procrastinate Positively \nIt's just possible that you've tried all the suggestions Tve \nmade about how to stop procrastinating—without success. \nO.K. If you have to procrastinate, I'm going to show you \nhow to do it positively. \nSit in a chair and do nothing. That's right—nothing. Don't \nread a book, don't shuffle papers, don't tackle your knitting, \ndon't watch TV—just sit completely still. \nIf you sit doing nothing for fifteen or twenty minutes \n(don't cheat—you must do absolutely nothing), you should \nbecome very uneasy. That A-l is staring you right in the \nface. And you're doing nothing. Precious minutes that you \ncan use accomplishing a lifetime goal are slipping by. And \nyou're sitting in a chair—doing nothing. Whenever I find my­\nself procrastinating, this is the technique I use. Believe me, \nafter ten minutes I'm off and running on my A-l, \n22. HOW TO DO BETTER NEXT TIME \nTo get the most out of the suggestions and techniques I've \ndescribed, a good deal of stick-to-itiveness or will-power is \ncalled for. You'll need willpower to: \n(1) plan when you're feeling harried and over­\nwhelmed; \n(2) keep yourself involved in a project even though \nsome of the instant tasks you try lead to a dead \nend; \n(3) avoid your favorite Escapes when you have an \nimportant but unpleasant A-l to do; \n(4) maintain a positive attitude in spite of previous \n\"failures\"; \n(5) do something every day on your Lifetime Goals; \n(6) overcome fears, real or imagined; \n(7) resist doing a very easy (but unimportant) task \nthat is right in front of you. \nEveryone knows that \"Where there's a will, there's a way.** \nAnd everyone has some willpower. But how do you develop \nall the willpower you really need? I'll now show you how to \ntake the willpower you already have and build on it so that \nit will be available to you when you need it most \nYou probably did many things today even though you \ndidn't want to do them: got up out of bed, caught the 7:51 \nto work, dictated that awkward letter, ordered the Diet Spe­\ncial at lunch, smiled cheerfully at Mrs. McPlump, who tried \nto tell you about her backache again, restrained your anger \nwhen your son came home with a rip in his best jacket, went \nto the PTA meeting when you really wanted to stay home \nout of the rain, held that yoga position an extra minute even \nthough your foot cramped. \n149 \n150 ALAN LAKEIN \nTry These Wfflpower-Boflding Exercises \nWell begin by doing some willpower-building exercises. At \nfirst well make them easy. The mistake most people make \nwhen they try to develop willpower is that they push too hard. \nWhen you go on a weight-lifting program, you don't start \nby lifting two-hundred-pound weights. If you'll set yourself \neasy tasks, you'll accomplish them. You wouldn't try to ride a \nbucking bronco if you didn't know how to ride a horse. Yet, \nyou're making the same mistake if you try to gather enough \nwillpower to lose thirty pounds off the bat. How about start­\ning with three? \nGood teachers know that children learn best when their \nwork is at the proper level so they can make steady growth. \nStudies show that learning a new skill in industry is greatly \nfacilitated if early efforts meet with success.

That way you can still enjoy lunch. \nYou'll probably moderate your alcoholic intake, allowing you \nto go after that A-l this afternoon. \n148 ALAN LAKEIN \nIf your Escape is going to the supermarket three times a \nweek, make it a rule that you'll go only once. To make sure \nthat you really won't need to go, do something concrete \nabout those meal-planning, stocking and freezing ideas you've \nbeen contemplating for years. If you forget something or run \nout, try to make do. \nThe Great Escape for nearly everybody is television. Lib­\nerate yourself! Give your set away and then stalk your A-ll \nOne final suggestion along these lines: You might want to \ngive your secretary a list of your favorite Escapes. lust the \nfact that you know she has the list may prevent you from \nutilizing these dodges except in the most severe cases. \nYon Can Procrastinate Positively \nIt's just possible that you've tried all the suggestions Tve \nmade about how to stop procrastinating—without success. \nO.K. If you have to procrastinate, I'm going to show you \nhow to do it positively. \nSit in a chair and do nothing. That's right—nothing. Don't \nread a book, don't shuffle papers, don't tackle your knitting, \ndon't watch TV—just sit completely still. \nIf you sit doing nothing for fifteen or twenty minutes \n(don't cheat—you must do absolutely nothing), you should \nbecome very uneasy. That A-l is staring you right in the \nface. And you're doing nothing. Precious minutes that you \ncan use accomplishing a lifetime goal are slipping by. And \nyou're sitting in a chair—doing nothing. Whenever I find my­\nself procrastinating, this is the technique I use. Believe me, \nafter ten minutes I'm off and running on my A-l, \n22. HOW TO DO BETTER NEXT TIME \nTo get the most out of the suggestions and techniques I've \ndescribed, a good deal of stick-to-itiveness or will-power is \ncalled for. You'll need willpower to: \n(1) plan when you're feeling harried and over­\nwhelmed; \n",

You'll need willpower to: \n(1) plan when you're feeling harried and over­\nwhelmed; \n(2) keep yourself involved in a project even though \nsome of the instant tasks you try lead to a dead \nend; \n(3) avoid your favorite Escapes when you have an \nimportant but unpleasant A-l to do; \n(4) maintain a positive attitude in spite of previous \n\"failures\"; \n(5) do something every day on your Lifetime Goals; \n(6) overcome fears, real or imagined; \n(7) resist doing a very easy (but unimportant) task \nthat is right in front of you. \nEveryone knows that \"Where there's a will, there's a way.** \nAnd everyone has some willpower. But how do you develop \nall the willpower you really need? I'll now show you how to \ntake the willpower you already have and build on it so that \nit will be available to you when you need it most \nYou probably did many things today even though you \ndidn't want to do them: got up out of bed, caught the 7:51 \nto work, dictated that awkward letter, ordered the Diet Spe­\ncial at lunch, smiled cheerfully at Mrs. McPlump, who tried \nto tell you about her backache again, restrained your anger \nwhen your son came home with a rip in his best jacket, went \nto the PTA meeting when you really wanted to stay home \nout of the rain, held that yoga position an extra minute even \nthough your foot cramped. \n149 \n150 ALAN LAKEIN \nTry These Wfflpower-Boflding Exercises \nWell begin by doing some willpower-building exercises. At \nfirst well make them easy. The mistake most people make \nwhen they try to develop willpower is that they push too hard. \nWhen you go on a weight-lifting program, you don't start \nby lifting two-hundred-pound weights. If you'll set yourself \neasy tasks, you'll accomplish them. You wouldn't try to ride a \nbucking bronco if you didn't know how to ride a horse. Yet, \nyou're making the same mistake if you try to gather enough \nwillpower to lose thirty pounds off the bat. How about start­\ning with three",

    "text": "? \nGood teachers know that children learn best when their \nwork is at the proper level so they can make steady growth. \nStudies show that learning a new skill in industry is greatly \nfacilitated if early efforts meet with success. The Royal Cana­\ndian Air Force exercises build gradually from day to day so \nthat the exerciser is hardly aware of the increased effort re­\nquired to do the next day's exercise; yet the cumulative effect \nover several months is significant. \nTherefore, I suggest that if you want to increase your will­\npower you begin by practicing in easy situations before ap­\nplying the willpower you're building to do more and more \ndifficult tasks. \nNormally, the only time when people consciously test their \nwillpower is when they need it. But if you apply it only when \nthe task is difficult and you need all the help you can get, it \nwill not be surprising if you fail fairly often. \nThe will is like a wild horse. If you want to train a wild \nhorse to do productive work, you obviously can't tame it by \nrunning away. You have to keep in contact with the horse. \nThere's really only one way to succeed: To get on that horse \nand stay on. Try to ride it. You may have to pick yourself off \nthe ground several times, but stick with it. The idea is to stay \nwith it even if the horse is going in the wrong direction. \nSuppose the horse is heading for its favorite spot far out in \nthe pasture. It's on a course that will take it between two \ntrees. You're not able to get it to do an about-face, but you \nmay be able to alter its course. If you continue this process \npatiently, you'll eventually be able to get the horse to go \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 151 \nHow to Wean Yourself Away from TV \nAt this point you've changed nothing about your actions. \nYou're still doing something contrary to what you want to \ndo, and you can't stop yourself. Claim credit for the decision. \nGo ahead, don't be afraid. Recognize that your will was in­\nvolved when you stayed in bed late or turned from your let­\nters to the TV. \nThe first step is to train yourself to become less compulsive \nabout \"reflex\" actions like watching television. But it's impor­\ntant to start small and selectively. Is there at least some part \nof the evening's entertainment you could give up? \nYou could decide that you'll turn down the sound during where you want it to go. You now have it \"under control.** \nHaving reached this stage, you can begin to turn its energy \ntoward productive work. \nIncreasing your willpower is like taming a wild horse. The \nkey is to move forward in gradual stages, as I shall explain. \nIt's an easy procedure. Indeed, it may seem too easy. Don't \ndiscount its potency because it doesn't demand much of you \nat first. Try it, you'll like it! And what's more, you'll find it \nextremely valuable. Here how it works. \nA person generally feels the need for willpower when he \nhas rationally decided to do one thing, yet is strongly pushed \nor pulled by the desire to do something else instead. You \nplan to get up early and take an invigorating hike, but stay in \nbed instead. Or you decide to spend the evening writing let­\nters instead of watching TV, but find yourself drawn away \nfrom the letters toward an interesting program. In the face \nof some desire to the contrary, sticking with your initial deci­\nsion can be very difficult. \nThe next time you find yourself giving in to such a desire \nrather than persisting with your rational decision, make a \nclear mental note of it Admit that you're the one who de­\ncided to stay in bed or to watch TV. Take credit for the \"un­\nwanted\" decision. \nGranted, the decision may not have been one over which \nyou had much control—you may have been acting as much \nfrom compulsion as from choice. Still, you did make a deci­\nsion of sorts, and it did lead you directly to some action. \n152 ALAN LAKEIN \nall the deodorant, toothpaste, and aspirin commercials. It \nisn't long before the first toothpaste ad appears. True to your \nplan, you get up and turn the sound down. Then you get up \nagain when the commercial is over and turn the sound up. \nYou do this twice more and decide you're tired of bouncing \nup and down. You say to yourself, \"I think this was a neat \nplan, but I will not turn the sound off any more tonight",

The Royal Cana­\ndian Air Force exercises build gradually from day to day so \nthat the exerciser is hardly aware of the increased effort re­\nquired to do the next day's exercise; yet the cumulative effect \nover several months is significant. \nTherefore, I suggest that if you want to increase your will­\npower you begin by practicing in easy situations before ap­\nplying the willpower you're building to do more and more \ndifficult tasks. \nNormally, the only time when people consciously test their \nwillpower is when they need it. But if you apply it only when \nthe task is difficult and you need all the help you can get, it \nwill not be surprising if you fail fairly often. \nThe will is like a wild horse. If you want to train a wild \nhorse to do productive work, you obviously can't tame it by \nrunning away. You have to keep in contact with the horse. \nThere's really only one way to succeed: To get on that horse \nand stay on. Try to ride it. You may have to pick yourself off \nthe ground several times, but stick with it. The idea is to stay \nwith it even if the horse is going in the wrong direction. \nSuppose the horse is heading for its favorite spot far out in \nthe pasture. It's on a course that will take it between two \ntrees. You're not able to get it to do an about-face, but you \nmay be able to alter its course. If you continue this process \npatiently, you'll eventually be able to get the horse to go \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 151 \nHow to Wean Yourself Away from TV \nAt this point you've changed nothing about your actions. \nYou're still doing something contrary to what you want to \ndo, and you can't stop yourself. Claim credit for the decision. \nGo ahead, don't be afraid. Recognize that your will was in­\nvolved when you stayed in bed late or turned from your let­\nters to the TV. \nThe first step is to train yourself to become less compulsive \nabout \"reflex\" actions like watching television.

The Royal Cana­\ndian Air Force exercises build gradually from day to day so \nthat the exerciser is hardly aware of the increased effort re­\nquired to do the next day's exercise; yet the cumulative effect \nover several months is significant. \nTherefore, I suggest that if you want to increase your will­\npower you begin by practicing in easy situations before ap­\nplying the willpower you're building to do more and more \ndifficult tasks. \nNormally, the only time when people consciously test their \nwillpower is when they need it. But if you apply it only when \nthe task is difficult and you need all the help you can get, it \nwill not be surprising if you fail fairly often. \nThe will is like a wild horse. If you want to train a wild \nhorse to do productive work, you obviously can't tame it by \nrunning away. You have to keep in contact with the horse. \nThere's really only one way to succeed: To get",

But it's impor­\ntant to start small and selectively. Is there at least some part \nof the evening's entertainment you could give up? \nYou could decide that you'll turn down the sound during where you want it to go. You now have it \"under control.** \nHaving reached this stage, you can begin to turn its energy \ntoward productive work. \nIncreasing your willpower is like taming a wild horse. The \nkey is to move forward in gradual stages, as I shall explain. \nIt's an easy procedure. Indeed, it may seem too easy. Don't \ndiscount its potency because it doesn't demand much of you \nat first. Try it, you'll like it! And what's more, you'll find it \nextremely valuable. Here how it works. \nA person generally feels the need for willpower when he \nhas rationally decided to do one thing, yet is strongly pushed \nor pulled by the desire to do something else instead. You \nplan to get up early and take an invigorating hike, but stay in \nbed instead. Or you decide to spend the evening writing let­\nters instead of watching TV, but find yourself drawn away \nfrom the letters toward an interesting program. In the face \nof some desire to the contrary, sticking with your initial deci­\nsion can be very difficult. \nThe next time you find yourself giving in to such a desire \nrather than persisting with your rational decision, make a \nclear mental note of it Admit that you're the one who de­\ncided to stay in bed or to watch TV. Take credit for the \"un­\nwanted\" decision. \nGranted, the decision may not have been one over which \nyou had much control—you may have been acting as much \nfrom compulsion as from choice. Still, you did make a deci­\nsion of sorts, and it did lead you directly to some action. \n152 ALAN LAKEIN \nall the deodorant, toothpaste, and aspirin commercials. It \nisn't long before the first toothpaste ad appears. True to your \nplan, you get up and turn the sound down. Then you get up \nagain when the commercial is over",

But it's impor­\ntant to start small and selectively. Is there at least some part \nof the evening's entertainment you could give up? \nYou could decide that you'll turn down the sound during where you want it to go. You now have it \"under control.** \nHaving reached this stage, you can begin to turn its energy \ntoward productive work. \nIncreasing your willpower is like taming a wild horse. The \nkey is to move forward in gradual stages, as I shall explain. \nIt's an easy procedure. Indeed, it may seem too easy. Don't \ndiscount its potency because it doesn't demand much of you \nat first. Try it, you'll like it! And what's more, you'll find it \nextremely valuable. Here how it works. \nA person generally feels the need for willpower when he \nhas rationally decided to do one thing, yet is strongly pushed \nor pulled by the desire to do something else instead. You \nplan to get up early",

    "text": " Here how it works. \nA person generally feels the need for willpower when he \nhas rationally decided to do one thing, yet is strongly pushed \nor pulled by the desire to do something else instead. You \nplan to get up early and take an invigorating hike, but stay in \nbed instead. Or you decide to spend the evening writing let­\nters instead of watching TV, but find yourself drawn away \nfrom the letters toward an interesting program. In the face \nof some desire to the contrary, sticking with your initial deci­\nsion can be very difficult. \nThe next time you find yourself giving in to such a desire \nrather than persisting with your rational decision, make a \nclear mental note of it Admit that you're the one who de­\ncided to stay in bed or to watch TV. Take credit for the \"un­\nwanted\" decision. \nGranted, the decision may not have been one over which \nyou had much control—you may have been acting as much \nfrom compulsion as from choice. Still, you did make a deci­\nsion of sorts, and it did lead you directly to some action. \n152 ALAN LAKEIN \nall the deodor",

    "text": " and turn the sound up. \nYou do this twice more and decide you're tired of bouncing \nup and down. You say to yourself, \"I think this was a neat \nplan, but I will not turn the sound off any more tonight.\" Af­\nter all, enough is enough. When the next commercial comes \nalong, you just sit there and congratulate yourself on not get­\nting up again. \nThe next day you begin again with the same plan, and this \ntime you get up six times before pooping out. Again you re­\nfuse to turn the sound down after that However, during a \nparticularly obnoxious commercial about midnight you find \nyourself starting to get up again. Now you cannot lose! If \nyou get up and turn it off, congratulate yourself on your will­\npower in going back to your original plan. If you do not turn \nit off, congratulate yourself on your willpower in resisting the \ndesire to turn it off and sticking to your revised decision not \nto get up again. \nInterpret whatever you do as exactly what you wanted to \ndo. This shows you're truly in control of your actions. \nThe next night, try a different strategy. This time turn off \nevery alternate bathroom products commercial. If you miss \none, don't be the least concerned. Simply tell yourself, \"I re­\nserve the right to change my mind and I've decided that ITl \nmake an exception in this case.\" Your making an exception \nalso helps to demonstrate that you're not an inflexible ma­\nchine but a thinking, feeling, spontaneous person. Be proud \nof it! Interpret all your actions as positive, as exactly what \nyou want to do. \nAfter a couple of weeks, turn the sound up and down on \nother kinds of commercials (margarine, coffee, automobile). \nYou're beginning to become more aware of how many differ­\nent kinds of commercials there are and how annoying they \ncan be. You're also starting to suspect that there must be a \nlot of things around that are more fun than watching TV \ncommercials. You can confirm this if you experiment by lis­\ntening carefully to every word of every commercial the next \nnight without exception. Notice how much willpower you've \nbuilt up to be able to listen closely to something that you are \nnow really beginning to dislike. \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 153 \nOne of my clients was particularly ingenious in developing \nhis willpower while watching TV. In his first experiments he \ndeliberately waited a few seconds until after the commercial \nwas over and he did not turn the sound back up until after \nthe program had actually resumed. He gradually extended \nthis soundless time from two seconds to five and then to fif­\nteen. Next he experimented with turning the whole set off \nwhen a bathroom product commercial came on, and read a \nmagazine while it was off. Sometimes he decided to finish \nreading the page before returning to a program that was not \none of his favorites. He continued experimenting and enlarg­\ning his area of freedom and the muscle of his willpower. He \nstarted turning the set on later and later in the evening. \nWithin six weeks he was able to turn the set off during half-\nhour segments which he knew from past experience would \nonly be disappointing programs. And all this time his ability \nto acquire increased control over his time-wasting urges \nmade him feel better about himself. \nWhen you attempt to develop your willpower remember: \ndon't try to push yourself too far, between extending your ca­\npabilities gradually and stretching yourself so far mat you \nbreak. Don't push yourself beyond your limits of endurance. \nThink in terms of extending your capabilities gradually, \nrather than stretching yourself to the breaking point \nA Couple of Extra Minutes Help \nAfter you demonstrate your willpower in little ways, on lit­\ntle tasks, on easy things, turn gradually to more difficult ones. \nIf you must confront a very difficult task, don't be concerned \nwith conquering it Be satisfied if you put up a little better \nfight than you might have six months ago. When you develop \nwillpower, time is on your side if you improve just a little \nevery day. \nGradually you are developing the internal self-discipline, \nthe internal desire to make good use of your time. This is \nmore important than the desire to do a particular Escape or \nto avoid a particular A-l. Little by Utile you are getting \nmore control over your time and over your life. \nThe better your willpower, the less trouble you'll experi­\nence when you want to get involved in a project You'll have \n154 ALAN LAKE IN \ndeveloped the habit of being committed to doing the best you \ncan on whatever is in front of you.

You say to yourself, \"I think this was a neat \nplan, but I will not turn the sound off any more tonight.\" Af­\nter all, enough is enough. When the next commercial comes \nalong, you just sit there and congratulate yourself on not get­\nting up again. \nThe next day you begin again with the same plan, and this \ntime you get up six times before pooping out. Again you re­\nfuse to turn the sound down after that However, during a \nparticularly obnoxious commercial about midnight you find \nyourself starting to get up again. Now you cannot lose! If \nyou get up and turn it off, congratulate yourself on your will­\npower in going back to your original plan. If you do not turn \nit off, congratulate yourself on your willpower in resisting the \ndesire to turn it off and sticking to your revised decision not \nto get up again. \nInterpret whatever you do as exactly what you wanted to \ndo. This shows you're truly in control of your actions. \nThe next night, try a different strategy. This time turn off \nevery alternate bathroom products commercial. If you miss \none, don't be the least concerned. Simply tell yourself, \"I re­\nserve the right to change my mind and I've decided that ITl \nmake an exception in this case.\" Your making an exception \nalso helps to demonstrate that you're not an inflexible ma­\nchine but a thinking, feeling, spontaneous person. Be proud \nof it! Interpret all your actions as positive, as exactly what \nyou want to do. \nAfter a couple of weeks, turn the sound up and down on \nother kinds of commercials (margarine, coffee, automobile). \nYou're beginning to become more aware of how many differ­\nent kinds of commercials there are and how annoying they \ncan be. You're also starting to suspect that there must be a \nlot of things around that are more fun than watching TV \ncommercials. You can confirm this if you experiment by lis­\ntening carefully to every word of every commercial the next \nnight without exception. Notice how much willpower you've \nbuilt up to be able to listen closely to something that you are \nnow really beginning to dislike. \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 153 \nOne of",

When the next commercial comes \nalong, you just sit there and congratulate yourself on not get­\nting up again. \nThe next day you begin again with the same plan, and this \ntime you get up six times before pooping out.

If \nyou get up and turn it off, congratulate yourself on your will­\npower in going back to your original plan. If you do not turn \nit off, congratulate yourself on your willpower in resisting the \ndesire to turn it off and sticking to your revised decision not \nto get up again. \nInterpret whatever you do as exactly what you wanted to \ndo. This shows you're truly in control of your actions. \nThe next night, try a different strategy. This time turn off \n",

    "text": " next \nnight without exception. Notice how much willpower you've \nbuilt up to be able to listen closely to something that you are \nnow really beginning to dislike. \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 153 \nOne of my clients was particularly ingenious in developing \nhis willpower while watching TV. In his first experiments he \ndeliberately waited a few seconds until after the commercial \nwas over and he did not turn the sound back up until after \nthe program had actually resumed. He gradually extended \nthis soundless time from two seconds to five and then to fif­\nteen. Next he experimented with turning the whole set off \nwhen a bathroom product commercial came on, and read a \nmagazine while it was off. Sometimes he decided to finish \nreading the page before returning to a program that was not \none of his favorites. He continued experimenting and enlarg­\ning his area of freedom and the muscle of his willpower. He \nstarted turning the set on later and later in the evening. \nWithin six weeks he was able to turn the set off during half-\nhour segments which he knew from past experience would \nonly be disappointing programs.

Notice how much willpower you've \nbuilt up to be able to listen closely to something that you are \nnow really beginning to dislike. \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 153 \nOne of my clients was particularly ingenious in developing \nhis willpower while watching TV. In his first experiments he \ndeliberately waited a few seconds until after the commercial \nwas over and he did not turn the sound back up until after \nthe program had actually resumed. He gradually extended \nthis soundless time from two seconds to five and then to fif­\nteen. Next he experimented with turning the whole set off \nwhen a bathroom product commercial came on, and read a \nmagazine while it was off. Sometimes he decided to finish \nreading the page before returning to a program that was not \none of his favorites. He continued experimenting and enlarg­\ning his area of freedom and the muscle of his willpower. He \nstarted turning the set on later and later in the evening. \nWithin six weeks he was able to turn the set off during half-\nhour segments which he knew from past experience would \nonly be disappointing programs. And all this time his ability \nto acquire increased control over his time-wasting",

Don't push yourself beyond your limits of endurance. \nThink in terms of extending your capabilities gradually, \nrather than stretching yourself to the breaking point \nA Couple of Extra Minutes Help \nAfter you demonstrate your willpower in little ways, on lit­\ntle tasks, on easy things, turn gradually to more difficult ones. \nIf you must confront a very difficult task, don't be concerned \nwith conquering it Be satisfied if you put up a little better \nfight than you might have six months ago.

You'll be a do-it-now per­\nson on whatever the A-l turns out to be. \nAlthough you recognize the limits on your endurance, try \nto go another sixty seconds before quitting your jogging. Al­\nthough you can't yet resist seconds on Mom's apple pie, you \ncan ask her to make the second piece a bit smaller than \nusual. Although you don't like raking the leaves, you realize \nyou're stuck with it and try not to make yourself quite as un­\nhappy as usual. What's the use of complaining to yourself ev-\nerytime the rake misses a leaf and you have to go back \nagain? \nTry to spend a couple of extra minutes on an unpleasant A \nbefore calling it a day. Cut back a couple of minutes on the \nC, even if it's your pet project. Don't turn to the TV for es­\ncape from an unpleasant A. Remember: a little more will \ncan eventually build up to a lot more willpower. \n23. DO YOUR BEST AND \nCONSIDER IT A SUCCESS \nARE YOU WILLING TO SPEND every evening this week to \nmake a start on attaining a lifetime goal even though success \nis not assured? If you don't try, you guarantee failure. If you \ndo try you have the chance to succeed, but failure is still a \npossibility. What to do? \nMost people spend their lives minimizing losses rather than \nmaximizing gains. For example, take reading the Sunday pa­\nper. Do you read every page because you're afraid you will \nmiss something? The more you move away from the front \npage, and those sections that you know interest you, the less \nnews you will find. The result: You waste time reading much \nthat doesn't really interest you, when you could have played \nwith the kids, read a book or worked in your darkroom. \nSome people use up valuable time by endlessly weighing \npros and cons for fear of taking a wrong step. Making \"mis­\ntakes\" can be a great time-saver. You find out what works by \ntrying. You get rid of unrealistic goals by having tried and \nfailed to accomplish them. For the rest of your life you \nmight have continued to cherish the dream of writing poetry. \nBut now that you've spent several evenings working steadily \nat it, you can assure yourself that given your personality, po­\netry is impossible—at least for the present. Forget it and find \na more realistic goal instead. What may seem defeating at \nfirst is really constructive: You're building bridges that will \neventually take you closer to where you really want to be. \nStudies have shown that people who hoped (and strived) \nfor success were happier and accomplished more than those \nwho feared (and expected) failure. If you're willing to accept \nthe initial failures on your way to success, you'll find the en­\nergy you need to keep digging until you hit pay dirt. Don't be \ndiscouraged by \"mistakes.\" Trial and error is part of being \nhuman. Think that each \"mistake\" is bringing you a little \ncloser to eventual success. \n155 \n156 ALAN LAKEIN \nI like to call this process **trial and success.\" I recall a par­\nticularly difficult period in my life when things just weren't \ngoing well. I kept telling myself that there were only a lim­\nited number of \"mistakes\" possible on my project and that \neach \"mistake\" I made brought me closer to what ultimately \nwould work. The important thing was not to make the same \n\"mistake\" too often. Sure enough, I finally saw the light— \nlong after I had hoped to be done with my job and after \nmuch more effort than I ever imagined at the beginning. \nFrom then on, things went better and better. With that ex­\nperience behind me, I continually look for new areas to make \ndo. It was trial and success. \nWhen you do something you've never done before, no mat­\nter how poorly it turns out, you're on your way to doing it \nbetter the next time. Whatever happens, you're further along \nthan if you had never done it at all. If it seems hard to ac­\ncept failure at first, remind yourself of that comforting \nsaying: \"If a thing is worth doing, it's worth doing badly I\" \nThe Value of Trial and Success \nA dance company was practicing for a new ballet and the \nleading man held the ballerina incorrectly. The effort looked \nvery ungraceful. The director asked the man whether he \nwished to repeat the movement. The",

You'll be a do-it-now per­\nson on whatever the A-l turns out to be. \nAlthough you recognize the limits on your endurance, try \nto go another sixty seconds before quitting your jogging. Al­\nthough you can't yet resist seconds on Mom's apple pie, you \ncan ask her to make the second piece a bit smaller than \nusual. Although you don't like raking the leaves, you realize \nyou're stuck with it and try not to make yourself quite as un­\nhappy as usual.

Do you read every page because you're afraid you will \nmiss something? The more you move away from the front \npage, and those sections that you know interest you, the less \nnews you will find. The result: You waste time reading much \nthat doesn't really interest you, when you could have played \nwith the kids, read a book or worked in your darkroom. \nSome people use up valuable time by endlessly weighing \npros and cons for fear of taking a wrong step. Making \"mis­\ntakes\" can be a great time-saver. You find out what works by \ntrying. You get rid of unrealistic goals by having tried and \nfailed to accomplish them.

DO YOUR BEST AND \nCONSIDER IT A SUCCESS \nARE YOU WILLING TO SPEND every evening this week to \nmake a start on attaining a lifetime goal even though success \nis not assured? If you don't try, you guarantee failure. If you \ndo try you have the chance to succeed, but failure is still a \npossibility.

    "text": "\ntakes\" can be a great time-saver. You find out what works by \ntrying. You get rid of unrealistic goals by having tried and \nfailed to accomplish them. For the rest of your life you \nmight have continued to cherish the dream of writing poetry. \nBut now that you've spent several evenings working steadily \nat it, you can assure yourself that given your personality, po­\netry is impossible—at least for the present. Forget it and find \na more realistic goal instead. What may seem defeating at \nfirst is really constructive: You're building bridges that will \neventually take you closer to where you really want to be. \nStudies have shown that people who hoped (and strived) \nfor success were happier and accomplished more than those \nwho feared (and expected) failure. If you're willing to accept \nthe initial failures on your way to success, you'll find the en­\nergy you need to keep digging until you hit pay dirt. Don't be \ndiscouraged by \"mistakes.\" Trial and error is part of being \nhuman. Think that each \"mistake\" is bringing you a little \ncloser to eventual success. \n155 \n156 ALAN LAKEIN \nI like to call this process **trial and success.\" I recall a par­\nticularly difficult period in my life when things just weren't \ngoing well. I kept telling myself that there were only a lim­\nited number of \"mistakes\" possible on my project and that \neach \"mistake\" I made brought me closer to what ultimately \nwould work. The important thing was not to make the same \n\"mistake\" too often. Sure enough, I finally saw the light— \nlong after I had hoped to be done with my job and after \nmuch more effort than I ever imagined at the beginning. \nFrom then on, things went better and better. With that ex­\nperience behind me, I continually look for new areas to make \ndo. It was trial and success. \nWhen you do something you've never done before, no mat­\nter how poorly it turns out, you're on your way to doing it \nbetter the next time. Whatever happens, you're further along \nthan if you had never done it at all. If it seems hard to ac­\ncept failure at first, remind yourself of that comforting \nsaying: \"If a thing is worth doing, it's worth doing badly I\" \nThe Value of Trial",

    "text": "\ntakes\" can be a great time-saver. You find out what works by \ntrying. You get rid of unrealistic goals by having tried and \nfailed to accomplish them. For the rest of your life you \nmight have continued to cherish the dream of writing poetry. \nBut now that you've spent several evenings working steadily \nat it, you can assure yourself that given your personality, po­\netry is impossible—at least for the present. Forget it and find \na more realistic goal instead. What may seem defeating at \nfirst is really constructive: You're building bridges that will \neventually take you closer to where you really want to be. \nStudies have shown that people who hoped (and strived) \nfor success were happier and accomplished more than those \nwho feared (and expected) failure. If you're willing to accept \nthe initial failures on your way to success, you'll find the en­\nergy you need to keep digging until you hit pay dirt. Don't be \ndiscouraged by \"mistakes.\" Trial and error is part of being \nhuman. Think that each \"mistake\" is bringing you a little \ncloser to eventual success. \n155 \n156 ALAN LAKEIN \nI like to call this",

Think that each \"mistake\" is bringing you a little \ncloser to eventual success. \n155 \n156 ALAN LAKEIN \nI like to call this process **trial and success.\" I recall a par­\nticularly difficult period in my life when things just weren't \ngoing well. I kept telling myself that there were only a lim­\nited number of \"mistakes\" possible on my project and that \neach \"mistake\" I made brought me closer to what ultimately \nwould work. The important thing was not to make the same \n\"mistake\" too often. Sure enough, I finally saw the light— \nlong after I had hoped to be done with my job and after \nmuch more effort than I ever imagined at the beginning. \nFrom then on, things went better and better. With that ex­\nperience behind me, I continually look for new areas to make \ndo. It was trial and success. \nWhen you do something you've never done before, no mat­\nter how poorly it turns out, you're on your way to doing it \nbetter the next time. Whatever happens, you're further along \nthan if",

    "text": " and Success \nA dance company was practicing for a new ballet and the \nleading man held the ballerina incorrectly. The effort looked \nvery ungraceful. The director asked the man whether he \nwished to repeat the movement. The dancer replied, \"No. It's \nnot necessary. Now I know what to do.\" The failure made \nthe rehearsal a success. The dancer now knew what he had to \ndo. It was trial and success. \nIn scientific research multiple \"failures\" commonly lead to \nsuccess. The combined unsuccessful experiments of Marie \nCurie, Alexander Fleming, and Louis Pasteur run into the \nthousands. It would have been easy for any one of them to \ngive up after the first hundred failures or so, but today we \nmight have no radium, no penicillin, and no pasteurized milk. \nOr take the following extraordinary personal history of \nfailure: \nLost job, 1832; defeated for legislature, 1832; failed in \nbusiness, 1833; elected to legislature, 1834; sweetheart died, \n1835; had nervous breakdown, 1836; defeated for Speaker, \n1838; defeated for nomination for Congress, 1843; elected to \nCongress, 1846; lost renomination, 1848; rejected for land \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 157 \nofficer, 1849; defeated for Senate, 1854; defeated for nomi­\nnation for Vice-President, 1856; again defeated for Senate, \n1858; but in 1860 Abraham Lincoln was elected President of \nthe United States. \nLife can only be led on a \"best efforts\" basis. To look back \nand say \"I could have done better\" is not realistic. O.K., so \nyou might have wished to do better. And you can imagine \nhaving done better. But the fact that you didn't means that, \nunder the circumstances, you couldn't. \nSo don't let failure stop you from trying. Don't waste time \nworrying about what went \"wrong.\" You can learn something \nfrom every experience. Remember: You're older and wiser \nthan the last time you dealt with a similar situation, even if it \nwas only fifteen minutes ago. \nThe habits of a lifetime cannot be changed in a few days. \nIt takes time—sometimes a year or two. There is no \"Open \nSesame\" to getting control of your time and your life. But \nyou can make much progress toward realizing your everyday \nand life goals in even a short time. I encourage you to begin \nas soon as you finish this page. I've seen remarkable results \nwhen people apply the techniques IVe recommended. \nYou too can get more enjoyment from every minute, be \nmore successful in your career and personal life, and accom­\nplish more with less effort. Today can mark a real turning \npoint for you. You can get more time out of your life. \nSo what is the best use of your time right now? \nAPPENDIX \nHow I Save Time \n1. I count all my time as \"On-Time\" and try to get satis­\nfaction (not necessarily accomplishment) out of every \nminute. \n2. I try to enjoy whatever I am doing. \n3. I'm a perennial optimist. \n4. I build on successes. \n5. I don't waste time regretting my failures. \n6. I don't waste my time feeling guilty about what I dont \ndo. \n7. I remind myself: \"There is always enough time for the \nimportant things.\" If it's important 111 make the time to \ndoit \n8. I try to find a new technique each day that I can use to \nhelp gain time. \n9. I get up at 5 a.m. during the week (and go to bed \nearly). \n10. I have a light lunch so I don't get sleepy in the after­\nnoon. \n11. I don't read newspapers or magazines (except occasion­\nally). I do glance at the headlines at the newsstands to \nkeep up on the world. \n12. I skim books quickly looking for ideas. \n13. I don't own a television set. (My family and I went to a \nmotel to watch the moon walks and we rented a set for \nthe political conventions.) \n14. I have my office close enough to my home to be able to \nwalk to work. But when I'm lazy or in a hurry I drive. \n15. I examine old habits for possible elimination or stream­\nlining. \n16. I've given up forever all \"waiting time.** If I have to \n158 \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 159 \nwait I consider it a \"gift of time\" to relax,",

    "text": " and Success \nA dance company was practicing for a new ballet and the \nleading man held the ballerina incorrectly. The effort looked \nvery ungraceful. The director asked the man whether he \nwished to repeat the movement. The dancer replied, \"No. It's \nnot necessary. Now I know what to do.\" The failure made \nthe rehearsal a success. The dancer now knew what he had to \ndo. It was trial and success. \nIn scientific research multiple \"failures\" commonly lead to \nsuccess. The combined unsuccessful experiments of Marie \nCurie, Alexander Fleming, and Louis Pasteur run into the \nthousands. It would have been easy for any one of them to \ngive up after the first hundred failures or so, but today we \nmight have no radium, no penicillin, and no pasteurized milk. \nOr take the following extraordinary personal history of \nfailure: \nLost job, 1832; defeated for legislature, 1832; failed in \nbusiness, 1833; elected to legislature, 1834; sweetheart died, \n1835; had nervous breakdown, 1836; defeated for Speaker, \n1838; defeated for nomination for Congress, 1843; elected to \nCongress, 1846; lost renomination, 1848; rejected for land \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 157 \nofficer, 1849; defeated for Senate, 1854; defeated for nomi­\nnation for Vice-President, 1856; again defeated for Senate, \n1858; but in 1860 Abraham Lincoln was elected President of \nthe United States. \nLife can only be led on a \"best efforts\" basis. To look back \nand say \"I could have done better\" is not realistic. O.K., so \nyou might have wished to do better. And you can imagine \nhaving done better. But the fact that you didn't means that, \nunder the circumstances, you couldn't. \nSo don't let failure stop you from trying. Don't waste time \nworrying about what went \"wrong.\" You can learn something \nfrom every experience. Remember: You're older and wiser \nthan the last time you dealt with a similar situation, even if it \nwas only fifteen minutes ago. \nThe habits of a lifetime cannot be changed in a few days. \nIt takes time—sometimes a year or two.

    "text": " and Success \nA dance company was practicing for a new ballet and the \nleading man held the ballerina incorrectly. The effort looked \nvery ungraceful. The director asked the man whether he \nwished to repeat the movement. The dancer replied, \"No. It's \nnot necessary. Now I know what to do.\" The failure made \nthe rehearsal a success. The dancer now knew what he had to \ndo. It was trial and success. \nIn scientific research multiple \"failures\" commonly lead to \nsuccess. The combined unsuccessful experiments of Marie \nCurie, Alexander Fleming, and Louis Pasteur run into the \nthousands. It would have been easy for any one of them to \ngive up after the first hundred failures or so, but today we \nmight have no radium, no penicillin, and no pasteurized milk. \nOr take the following extraordinary personal history of \nfailure: \nLost job, 1832; defeated for legislature, 1832; failed in \nbusiness, 1833; elected to legislature, 1834; sweetheart died, \n1835; had nervous breakdown, 1836; defeated for Speaker, \n1838; defeated for nomination for Congress, 1843;",

I've given up forever all \"waiting time.** If I have to \n158 \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 159 \nwait I consider it a \"gift of time\" to relax, plan or do \nsomething I would not otherwise have done. \n17. I keep my watch 3 minutes fast, to get a head start on \nthe day. \n18. I carry blank 3x5 index cards in my pocket to jot down \nnotes and ideas. \n19. I revise my lifetime goals list once a month. \n20. I review my lifetime goals list every day and identify ac­\ntivities to do each day to further my goals. \n21. I put signs in my office reminding me of my goals. \n22. I keep my long-term goals in mind even while doing \nthe smallest task. \n23. I always plan first thing in the morning and set priorities \nfor the day. \n24. I keep a list of specific items to be done each day, ar­\nrange them in priority order, and then do my best to get \nthe important ones done as soon as possible. \n25. I schedule my time months in advance in such a way \nthat each month offers variety and balance as well as \n\"open time\" reserved for \"hot\" projects. \n26. I give myself time off and special rewards when I've \ndone the important things. \n27. I do first things first. \n28. I work smarter rather than harder. \n29. I try to do only A's, never B's and Cs. \n30. I have confidence in my judgment of priorities and \nstick to them in spite of difficulties. \n31. I ask myself, \"Would anything terrible happen if I didn't \ndo this priority item?\" If the answer is no, I don't do it. \n32. If I seem to procrastinate I ask myself: \"What am I \navoiding?\"—and then I try to confront that thing head-\non. \n33. I always use the 80/20 rule. \n34. I start with the most profitable parts of large projects \nand often find it is not necessary to do the rest. \n35. I cut off nonproductive activities as quickly as possible. \n36. I give myself enough time to concentrate on high prior­\nity items. \n37. I have developed the ability to concentrate well for long \nstretches of time (sometimes with the aid of coffee). \n38. I concentrate on one thing at a time. \n160 ALAN LAKEIN \n39. I focus my efforts on items that will have the best \nlong-term benefits. \n40. I keep pushing and am persistent when I sense I have \na winner. \n41. I have trained myself to go down my To Do List without \nskipping over the difficult items. \n42. I do much of my thinking on paper. \n43. I work alone creatively in the morning and use the af­\nternoons for meetings, if necessary. \n44. I set deadlines for myself and others. \n45. I try to listen actively in every discussion. \n46. I try not to waste other people's time (unless it's some­\nthing that really matters to me). \n47. I delegate everything I possibly can to others. \n48. I make use of specialists to help me with special prob­\nlems. \n49. I have someone screen my mail and phone calk and \nhandle all routine matters. \n50. I generate as little paperwork as possible and throw \naway anything I possibly can. \n51. I handle each piece of paper only once. \n52. I write replies to most letters right on the piece of paper. \n53. I keep my desk top cleared for action, and put the most \nimportant thing in the center of my desk. \n54. I have a place for everything (so I waste as little time \nas possible looking for things). \n55. I save up all trivia for a three-hour session once a \nmonth. \n56. I try not to think of work on weekends. \n57. I relax and \"do nothing*' rather frequently. \n58. I recognize that inevitably some of my time will be \nspent on activities outside my control and don't fret \nabout it \n59. I keep small talk to a minimum during work hours. \n60. I look for action steps to be taken now to further my \ngoals. \n61. I'm continually asking myself: \"What is the best use of \nmy time right now?\"",

I keep my watch 3 minutes fast, to get a head start on \nthe day. \n18. I carry blank 3x5 index cards in my pocket to jot down \nnotes and ideas. \n19. I revise my lifetime goals list once a month. \n20. I review my lifetime goals list every day and identify ac­\ntivities to do each day to further my goals. \n21. I put signs in my office reminding me of my goals. \n22. I keep my long-term goals in mind even while doing \nthe smallest task. \n23. I always plan first thing in the morning and set priorities \nfor the day. \n24. I keep a list of specific items to be done each day, ar­\nrange them in priority order, and then do my best to get \nthe important ones done as soon as possible. \n25. I schedule my time months in advance in such a way \nthat each month offers variety and balance as well as \n\"open time\" reserved for \"hot\" projects. \n26. I give myself time off and special rewards when I've \ndone the important things. \n27. I do first things first. \n28. I work smarter rather than harder. \n29. I try to do only A's, never B's and Cs. \n30. I have confidence in my judgment of priorities and \nstick to them in spite of difficulties. \n31. I ask myself, \"Would anything terrible happen if I didn't \ndo this priority item?\" If the answer is no, I don't do it. \n32. If I seem to procrastinate I ask myself: \"What am I \navoiding?\"—and then I try to confront that thing head-\non. \n33. I always use the 80/20 rule. \n34. I start with the most profitable parts of large projects \nand often find it is not necessary to do the rest. \n35. I cut off nonproductive activities as quickly as possible. \n36. I give myself enough time to concentrate on high prior­\nity items. \n37. I have developed the ability to concentrate well for long \nstretches",

I give myself time off and special rewards when I've \ndone the important things. \n27. I do first things first. \n28. I work smarter rather than harder. \n29. I try to do only A's, never B's and Cs. \n30. I have confidence in my judgment of priorities and \nstick to them in spite of difficulties. \n31. I ask myself, \"Would anything terrible happen if I didn't \ndo this priority item?\" If the answer is no, I don't do it. \n32. If I seem to procrastinate I ask myself: \"What am I \navoiding?\"—and then I try to confront that thing head-\non. \n33. I always use the 80/20 rule. \n34.
