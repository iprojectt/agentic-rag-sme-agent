    "text": "The Power of Outcome Focusing \nTHE POWER OF directing our mental and imaginative p rocesses to \ncreate change has been studied and promoted in thou sands of \ncontexts—from the early \"positive thinking\" books t o recent dis- \ncoveries in advanced neurophysiology. \nMy own interest has been in applying of the princip le in \nterms of practical reality: Does it help get things  done? And if so, \nhow do we best utilize it in managing the work of o ur lives? Can \nwe really use this information in ways that allow u s to produce \nwhat we want to have happen with less effort? The a nswer has \nbeen a resounding yes. \nFocus and the Fast Track \nOver the years I have seen the application of the m ethod pre- \nsented in this book create profound results for peo ple in their day- \nto-day worlds. As you begin to use it habitually as  your primary \nmeans of addressing all situations—from processing e-mails, to \nbuying a house or a company, to structuring meeting s or having \nconversations with your kids—your personal producti vity can go \nthrough the roof. \nMany of the professionals I have worked with who in te- \ngrated this method now find themselves experiencing  enhanced \nor even new jobs and careers. These processes reall y work in the \narena of the ordinary things we must deal with dail y—the stuff \nof \n249 \n250 THE POWER OF THE KEY PRINCIPLES  |  PART THREE \nour work. When you demonstrate to yourself and to o thers an \nincreasing ability to get things done \"in the trenc hes,\" you proba- \nbly won't stay in the same trench for very long.* I t's been inspiring \nfor me to learn and coach others how to deal with t he immediate \nrealities down where the rubber hits the road—and h ow to tie in \nthe power of positive imagery to practical experien ces in all our \ndaily lives. \nThe \"fast track\" alluded to in the section heading above is a \nbit of misnomer. For some, slowing down, getting ou t of the squir- \nrel cage, and taking care of themselves may be the major change \nprecipitated by this methodology. The bottom line i s it makes you \nmore conscious, more focused, and more capable of i mplementing \nthe changes and results you want, whatever they are . \n\"Create a way to regularly spend more time with my daugh- \nter\" is as specific a project as any, and equally d emanding of a next \naction to be determined. Having the vague, gnawing sense that \nyou \"should\" do something about your relationship w ith your \ndaughter, and not actually doing anything, can be a  killer. I often \nwork with clients who are willing to acknowledge th e real things \nof their lives at this level as \"incompletes\"—to wr ite them down, \ndefine real projects about them, and ensure that ne xt actions are \ndecided on—until the finish line is crossed. That i s real productiv- \nity, perhaps in its most awesome manifestation. \nThe Significance of Applied Outcome Thinking \nWhat I want to emphasize now is how learning to pro cess the \ndetails of our work and lives with this clear and c onsistent system \n*Of course, the people who are most attracted to implementing Getting Things \nDone are usually already on a self-development track and  don't assume that \nthey'll be doing the same thing a year from now tha t they're doing now, any- \nway. But they love the fact that this method gets th em there faster and more \neasily. \nCHAPTER 13 I THE POWER OF OUTCOME FOCUSING \ncan affect others and ourselves in significant ways  we may not \nexpect. \nAs I've said, employing next-action decision- \nmaking results in clarity, productivity, accountabi lity, \nand empowerment. Exactly the same results happen \nwhen you hold yourself to the discipline of identif y- \ning the real results you want and, more specificall y, \nthe projects you need to define in order to produce\nthem. \nIt's all connected. You can't really define the \nright action until you know the outcome, and your o utcome is dis- \nconnected from reality if you're not clear about wh at you need to \ndo physically to make it happen. You can get at it from either \ndirection, and you must, to get things done. \nAs an expert in whole-brain learning and good frien d of \nmine, Steven Snyder, put it, \"There are only two pr oblems in life: \n(1) you know what you want, and you don't know how to get it; \nand/or (2) you don't know what you want",

And if so, \nhow do we best utilize it in managing the work of o ur lives? Can \nwe really use this information in ways that allow u s to produce \nwhat we want to have happen with less effort? The a nswer has \nbeen a resounding yes. \nFocus and the Fast Track \nOver the years I have seen the application of the m ethod pre- \nsented in this book create profound results for peo ple in their day- \nto-day worlds.

But they love the fact that this method gets th em there faster and more \neasily. \nCHAPTER 13 I THE POWER OF OUTCOME FOCUSING \ncan affect others and ourselves in significant ways  we may not \nexpect. \nAs I've said, employing next-action decision- \nmaking results in clarity, productivity, accountabi lity, \nand empowerment. Exactly the same results happen \nwhen you hold yourself to the discipline of identif y- \ning the real results you want and, more specificall y, \nthe projects you need to define in order to produce\nthem. \nIt's all connected. You can't really define the \nright action until you know the outcome, and your o utcome is dis- \nconnected from reality if you're not clear about",

The \ntruth is, our energy as human beings seems to have a \ndualistic and teleological reality—we create and id entify with \nthings that aren't real yet on all the levels we ex perience; and \nwhen we do, we recognize how to restructure our cur rent world \nto morph it into the new one, and experience an imp etus to make \nit so. \nThings that have your attention need your in tention \nengaged. \"What does this mean to me?\" \"Why is it he re?\" \"What \ndo I want to have be true about this?\" (\"What's the  successful \n251 Defining specific \nprojects and next\nactions that address \nreal quality-of- \nlife issues is \nproductivity at\nits best.\nWe are constantly \ncreating and \nfulfilling.\nTHE POWER OF THE KEY PRINCIPLES  I  PART THREE \noutcome?\") Everything you experience as incomplete \nmust have a reference point for \"complete.\" \nOnce you've decide that there is something \nto be changed and a mold to fill, you ask yourself,\n\"How do I now make this happen?\" and/or \"What \nresources do I need to allocate to make it happen?\"\n(\"What's the next action?\"). \nYour life and work are made up of outcomes and \nactions. When your operational behavior is grooved \nto organize everything that comes your way, at all \nlevels, based upon those dynamics, a deep align- \nment occurs, and wondrous things emerge. You be- \ncome highly productive. You make things up, and you  make them \nhappen. \n252 The Magic of Mastering the Mundane \nMy clients often wonder how I can sit with them in their offices, \noften for hours on end, as they empty the drawers o f their desks \nand painstakingly go through the minutiae of stuff that they have \nlet accumulate in their minds and their physical sp ace. Aside from \nthe common embarrassment they feel about the volume  of their \nirresponsibly dealt-with details, they assume I sho uld be bored to \ntears. Quite the contrary. Much to my own surprise,  I find it to be \nsome of the most engaging work I do with -people. I  know the \nrelease and relief and freedom that sit on the othe r side of dealing \nwith these things. I know that we all need practice  and support \nand a strong, clear focus to get through them, unti l we have the \nbuilt-in standards and behaviors we need to engage with them as \nthey demand. I know how significant a change these people may \nexperience in their relationships with their bosses , their partners, \ntheir spouses, their kids, and themselves over the next few hours \nand (we hope) days and years. \nIt's not boring. It's some of the best work we do. Life affords no \nhigher pleasure \nthan that of \nsurmounting \ndifficulties, passing \nfrom one step of \nsuccess to another, \nforming new \nwishes and seeing \nthem gratified. \n—Dr. \nSamuel \nCHAPTER 13  I THE POWER OF OUTCOME FOCUSING \nI'm in the focus business. As a consultant and coac h, \nI ask simple questions that often elicit very creat ive \nand intelligent responses from others (and even \nmyself!), which can in turn add value to the situat ion \nand work at hand. People aren't any smarter after \nthey work with me than they were before—they just \ndirect and utilize their intelligence more producti vely. \nWhat's unique about the practical focus of Getting Things \nDone is the combination of effectiveness and efficiency that these \nmethods can bring to every level of your reality. T here are lots of \ninspirational sources for the high-level \"purpose, values, vision\" \nkind of thinking, and many more mundane tools for g etting hold \nof smaller details such as phone numbers and appoin tments and \ngrocery lists. The world has been rather barren, ho wever, of prac- \ntices that relate equally to both levels, and tie t hem together. \n\"What does this mean to me?\" \"What do I want \nto have be true about it?\" \"What's the next step \nrequired to make that happen?\" These are the corner -",

The \ntruth is, our energy as human beings seems to have a \ndualistic and teleological reality—we create and id entify with \nthings that aren't real yet on all the levels we ex perience; and \nwhen we do, we recognize how to restructure our cur rent world \nto morph it into the new one, and experience an imp etus to make \nit so. \nThings that have your attention need your in tention \nengaged. \"What does this mean to me?\" \"Why is it he re?\" \"What \ndo I want to have be true about this?\" (\"What's the  successful \n251 Defining specific \nprojects and next\nactions that address \nreal quality-of- \nlife issues is \nproductivity at\nits best.\nWe are constantly \ncreating and \nfulfilling.\nTHE POWER OF THE KEY PRINCIPLES  I  PART THREE \noutcome?\") Everything you experience as incomplete \nmust have a reference point for \"complete.\" \nOnce you've decide that there is something \nto be changed and a mold to fill, you ask yourself,\n\"How do I now make this happen?\" and/or \"What \nresources do I need to allocate to make it happen?\"\n(\"What's the next action?\"). \nYour life and work are made up of outcomes and \nactions. When your operational behavior is grooved \nto organize everything that comes your way, at all \nlevels, based upon those dynamics, a deep align- \nment occurs, and wondrous things emerge.

Aside from \nthe common embarrassment they feel about the volume  of their \nirresponsibly dealt-with details, they assume I sho uld be bored to \ntears. Quite the contrary. Much to my own surprise,  I find it to be \nsome of the most engaging work I do with -people. I  know the \nrelease and relief and freedom that sit on the othe r side of dealing \nwith these things. I know that we all need practice  and support \nand a strong, clear focus to get through them, unti l we have the \nbuilt-in standards and behaviors we need to engage with them as \nthey demand. I know how significant a change these people may \nexperience in their relationships with their bosses , their partners, \ntheir spouses, their kids, and themselves over the next few hours \nand (we hope) days and years. \nIt's not boring. It's some of the best work we do. Life affords no \nhigher pleasure \nthan that of \nsurmounting \ndifficulties, passing \nfrom one step of \nsuccess to another, \nforming new \nwishes and seeing \nthem gratified. \n—Dr. \nSamuel \nCHAPTER 13  I THE POWER OF OUTCOME FOCUSING \nI'm in the focus business. As a consultant and coac h, \nI ask simple questions that often elicit very creat ive \nand intelligent responses from others (and even \nmyself!), which can in turn add value to the situat ion \nand work at hand. People aren't any smarter after \nthey work with me than they were before—they just \ndirect and utilize their intelligence more producti vely. \nWhat's unique about the practical focus of Getting Things \nDone is the combination of effectiveness and efficiency that these \nmethods can bring to every level of your reality. T here are lots of \ninspirational sources for the high-level \"purpose, values, vision\" \nkind of thinking, and many more mundane tools for g etting hold \nof smaller details such as phone numbers and appoin tments and \ngrocery lists. The world has been rather barren, ho wever, of prac- \ntices that relate",

Aside from \nthe common embarrassment they feel about the volume  of their \nirresponsibly dealt-with details, they assume I sho uld be bored to \ntears. Quite the contrary. Much to my own surprise,  I find it to be \nsome of the most engaging work I do with -people. I  know the \nrelease and relief and freedom that sit on the othe r side of dealing \nwith these things. I know that we all need practice  and support \nand a strong, clear focus to get through them, unti l we have the \nbuilt-in standards and behaviors we need to engage with them as \nthey demand. I know how significant a change these people may \nexperience in their relationships with their bosses , their partners, \ntheir spouses, their kids, and themselves over the next few hours \nand (we hope) days and years. \nIt's not boring. It's some of the best work we do. Life affords",

This thinking, and the tools that suppo rt \nit, will serve you in ways you may not yet imagine.\nThe Power of Natural Planning \nThe value of all this natural project planning is t hat it \nprovides an integrated, flexible, aligned way to th ink \nthrough any situation. \nBeing comfortable with challenging the pur- \npose of anything you may be doing is healthy and ma ture.

A realist \nbelieves that what \nis done or left \nundone in the short \nrun determines the \nlong run. \n—Sidney]. \n254 THE POWER OF THE KEY PRINCIPLES  I  PART THREE \nhave ideas, good or bad, and to express and capture  all of them \nwithout judgments is critical for fully accessing c reative intelli- \ngence. Honing multiple ideas and types of informati on into com- \nponents, sequences, and priorities aimed toward a s pecific \noutcome is a necessary mental discipline. And decid ing on and \ntaking real next actions—actually moving on somethi ng in the \nphysical world—are the essence of productivity. \nBeing able to bring all these ingredients together,  with \nappropriate timing and balance, is perhaps the majo r component \nof professional competence for this new millennium.  But it's not \nyet the norm in professional behavior; far from it.  It's still a daunt- \ning task to apply this awareness to all the aspects  of personal and \nprofessional life. But even when only portions of t he model are \ninserted, tremendous benefit ensues. \nThe feedback I have gotten over the years in my con sulting, \nteaching, and coaching with this model has continue d to validate \nthat even the slightest increase in the use of natu ral planning can \nbring significant improvement. To see brainstorming  about \nalmost every aspect of their lives becoming a stand ard tool for \nmany people is terrific. To hear from executives wh o have used the \nmodel as a way to frame key meetings and discussion s, and have \ngotten great value from doing that, is gratifying. It all just affirms \nthat the way our minds naturally work is the way th at we should \nfocus to make anything happen in the physical world . \nThe model is simply the basic principle of determin ing out- \ncomes and actions for everything we consider to be our work. \nWhen those two key focus points become the norm in our day- \nto-day lives, the baseline for productivity moves t o another level. \nThe addition of brainstorming—the most creative mea ns of \nexpressing and capturing ideas, perspectives, and d etails about \nprojects—makes for an elegant set of behaviors for staying relaxed \nand getting things done. \nCHAPTER 13  | THE POWER OF OUTCOME FOCUSING \nShifting to a Positive Organizational Culture \nIt doesn't take a big change to increase the produc tivity standards \nof a group. I continually get feedback indicating t hat with a little \nimplementation, this method immediately makes thing s happen \nmore quickly and more easily. \nThe constructive evaluation of activities, asset al locations, \ncommunications, policies, and procedures against pu rposes and \nintended outcomes has become increasingly critical for every \norganization I know of. The challenges to our compa nies con- \ntinue to mount, with pressures coming these days fr om globali- \nzation, competition, technology, shifting markets, and raised \nstandards of performance and production. \n\"What do we want to have happen in this meeting?\" \" What \nis the purpose of this form?\" \"What would the ideal  person for \nthis job be able to do?\" \"What do we want to accomp lish with this \nsoftware?\" These and a multitude of other, similar questions are \nstill sorely lacking in many quarters. There's plen ty of talk in the \nBig Meetings that sounds good, but learning to ask \"Why are we \ndoing this?\" and \"What will it look like when it's done success- \nfully?\" and to apply the answers at the day-to-day operational \n",

When that becomes th e standard in a \ngroup, it creates significant improvement in the at mosphere as well \nas the output. There are enough other problems to b e concerned \nwith; negativity and passive resistance need to con tinually give way \nto a focus on the desired results at the appropriat e horizons. \nThe microcosm of how people deal with their in-bask ets, \ne-mail, and conversations with others will be refle cted in the \nmacro-reality of their culture and organization. If  balls are \ndropped, if decisions about what to do are resisted  on the front \nend, if not all the open loops are managed responsi bly, that will be \n255 \nTHE POWER OF THE KEY PRINCIPLES  I  PART THREE \nA vision without \na task is but a \ndream, a task \nwithout a vision is \ndrudgery, a vision \nand a task is the \nhope of the world. \n—From a church \nin \nSussex, England, \nca.1730 magnified in the group, and the culture will sustai n a \nstressful fire-and-crisis siege mentality. If, in c on- \ntrast, individuals are implementing the principles of \nGetting Things Done, the culture will expect and \nexperience a new standard of high performance. \nProblems and conflicts will not go away—they \nremain inherent as you attempt to change (or main- \ntain) anything in this world. The operational behav - \niors of this book, however, will provide the focus and \nframework for addressing them in the most produc- \ntive way. \n256",

When that becomes th e standard in a \ngroup, it creates significant improvement in the at mosphere as well \nas the output. There are enough other problems to b e concerned \nwith; negativity and passive resistance need to con tinually give way \nto a focus on the desired results at the appropriat e horizons. \nThe microcosm of how people deal with their in-bask ets, \ne-mail, and conversations with others will be refle cted in the \nmacro-reality of their culture and organization. If  balls are \ndropped, if decisions about what to do are resisted  on the front \nend, if not all the open loops are managed responsi bly, that will be \n255 \nTHE POWER OF THE KEY PRINCIPLES  I  PART THREE \nA vision without \na task is but a \ndream, a task \nwithout a vision is \ndrudgery, a vision \nand a task is the \nhope of the world. \n—From a church \nin \nSussex, England, \nca.1730 magnified in the group, and the culture will sustai n a \nstressful fire-and-crisis siege mentality. If, in c on- \ntrast, individuals are implementing the principles of \nGetting Things Done, the culture will expect and \nexperience a new standard of high performance. \nProblems and conflicts will not go away—they \nremain inherent as you attempt to change (or main- \ntain) anything in this world. The operational behav - \niors of this book, however, will provide the focus and \nframework for addressing them in the most produc- \ntive way. \n256",
