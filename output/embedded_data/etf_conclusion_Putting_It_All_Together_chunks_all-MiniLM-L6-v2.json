Every minute you\nspend in planning can save you five or ten minutes in execution;\n3. Apply the 80/20 Rule to everything: Twenty percent of your\nactivities will account for eighty percent of your results. Always\nconcentrate your efforts on that top twenty percent;\n4.

Focus on these above all\nelse;\n5. Practice creative procrastination: Since you can’t do everything,you must learn to deliberately put off those tasks that are of lowvalue so that you have enough time to do the few things thatreally count;\n6. Use the ABCDE Method continually : Before you begin work on a\nlist of tasks, take a few moments to organize them by value andpriority so you can be sure of working on your most importantactivities:\n7.

Assemble all papers, information, tools,work materials and numbers so that you can get started and keepgoing.\n10.

And when you develop the habit of starting on your mostimportant task, before anything else, your success is assured.\nHere is a summary of the 21 Great Ways to stop procrastinating and\nget more things done faster. Review these rules and principles\nregularly until they become firmly ingrained in your thinking and\nactions and your future will be guaranteed.\n1. Set the table: Decide exactly what you want. Clarity is essential.\nWrite out your goals and objectives before you begin;\n2. Plan every day in advance: Think on paper. Every minute you\nspend in planning can save you five or ten minutes in execution;\n3. Apply the 80/20 Rule to everything: Twenty percent of your\nactivities will account for eighty percent of your results. Always\nconcentrate your efforts on that top twenty percent;\n4. Consider the consequences : Your most important tasks and\npriorities are those that can have the most serious consequences,\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 121positive or negative, on your life or work. Focus on these above all\nelse;\n5. Practice creative procrastination: Since you can’t do everything,you must learn to deliberately put off those tasks that are of lowvalue so that you have enough time to do the few things thatreally count;\n6. Use the ABCDE Method continually : Before you begin work on a\nlist of tasks, take a few moments to organize them by value andpriority so you can be sure of working on your most importantactivities:\n7. Focus on key result areas: Identify and determine those resultsthat you absolutely, positively have to get to do your job well, andwork on them all day long;\n8. The Law of Three: Identify the three things you do in your work\nthat account for 90% of your contribution and focus on getting\nthem done before anything else. You will then have more time foryour family and personal life;\n9. Prepare thoroughly before you begin: have everything you need\nat hand before you start. Assemble all papers, information, tools,work materials and numbers so that you can get started and keepgoing.\n",
