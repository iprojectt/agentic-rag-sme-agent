You must develop a routine of coaching yourself andencouraging yourself to play at the top of your game.\nMost of your emotions, positive or negative, are determined by how\nyou talk to yourself on a minute-to-minute basis. It is not what\nhappens to you but the way that you interpret the things that are\nhappening to you that determines how you feel. It is your version of\nevents that largely determines whether they motivate or demotivateyou, whether they energize or de-energize you.\nTo keep yourself motivated, you must resolve to become a complete\noptimist . You must determine to respond positively to the words,\nactions and reactions of the people and situations around you. Youmust refuse to let the unavoidable difficulties and setbacks of daily\nlife affect your mood or emotions.\nControl Your Inner Dialogue\nYour level of self-esteem, how much you like and respect yourself, is\ncentral to your levels of motivation and persistence. You should talk\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 93to yourself positively all the time to boost your self-esteem. Say\nthings like, \"I like myself! I like myself!\" over and over until you\nbegin to believe it and behave like a person with a high performance\npersonality.\nTo keep yourself motivated, and to overcome feelings of doubt or\nfear, continually tell yourself, \"I can do it! I can do it!\"\nWhen people ask you how you are, always tell them, \"I feel terrific!\"\nNo matter how you really feel at the moment, or what is happening\nin your life, resolve to remain cheerful and upbeat. As Victor Franklwrote in his best selling book, Logotherapy , “The last great freedom\nof mankind is the freedom to choose your attitude under any set of\nexternal conditions.”\nRefuse to complain about your problems. Keep them to yourself. As\nspeaker/humorist Ed Forman says, “You should never share your\nproblems with others because 80% of people don't care about them\nanyway, and the other 20% are kind of glad that you've got them in\nthe first place.”\nDevelop a Positive Mental Attitude\nIn Martin Seligman’s 22 year study at the University of Pennsylvania,\nsummarized in his book, “Learned Optimism,” he determined that\n“optimism” is the most important quality you can develop for\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 94personal and professional success and happiness. Optimistic people\nseem to be more effective in almost every area of life.\nIt turns out that optimists have three special behaviors, all learned\nthrough practice and repetition. First, optimists look for the good  in\nevery situation. No matter what goes wrong, they always look for\nsomething good or beneficial. And not surprisingly, they always\nseem to find it.\nSecond, optimists always seek the valuable lesson in every setback\nor difficulty. They believe that , ”difficulties come not to obstruct, but to\ninstruct.”  They believe that each setback or obstacle contains a\nvaluable lesson they can learn and grow from, and they are\ndetermined to find it.\nThird, optimists always look for the solution to every problem.\nInstead of blaming or complaining when things go wrong, they\nbecome action oriented. They ask questions like, \"What's the\nsolution? What can we do now? What's the next step?\"\nThird, optimists think and talk continually about their goals . They\nthink about what they want and how to get it, most of the time. They\nthink and talk about the future and where they are going rather than\nthe past and where they came from. They are always looking forward\nrather than backward.\nWhen you continually visualize your goals and ideals and talk to\nyourself in a positive way, you feel more focused and energized. You\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 95feel more confident and creative. You experience a greater sense of\ncontrol and personal power.\nAnd the more positive and motivated you feel, the more eager you\nare to get started and the more determined you are to keep going.\nEat That Frog!\n1.  Control your thoughts. Remember, you become what you think\nabout most of the time. Be sure that you are thinking and talking\nabout the things you want rather than the things you don’t want.\n2.  Keep your mind positive by accepting complete responsibility for\nyourself and for everything that happens to you. Refuse to criticize,\ncomplain or blame others for anything. Resolve to make progress\nrather than excuses. Keep",

You must develop a routine of coaching yourself andencouraging yourself to play at the top of your game.\nMost of your emotions, positive or negative, are determined by how\nyou talk to yourself on a minute-to-minute basis. It is not what\nhappens to you but the way that you interpret the things that are\nhappening to you that determines how you feel. It is your version of\nevents that largely determines whether they motivate or demotivateyou, whether they energize or de-energize you.\nTo keep yourself motivated, you must resolve to become a complete\noptimist . You must determine to respond positively to the words,\nactions and reactions of the people and situations around you. Youmust refuse to let the unavoidable difficulties and setbacks of daily\nlife affect your mood or emotions.\nControl Your Inner Dialogue\nYour level of self-esteem, how much you like and respect yourself, is\ncentral to your levels of motivation and persistence. You should talk\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 93to yourself positively all the time to boost your self-esteem. Say\nthings like, \"I like myself! I like myself!\" over and over until you\nbegin to believe it and behave like a person with a high performance\npersonality.\nTo keep yourself motivated, and to overcome feelings of doubt or\nfear, continually tell yourself, \"I can do it! I can do it!\"\nWhen people ask you how you are, always tell them, \"I feel terrific!\"\nNo matter how you really feel at the moment, or what is happening\nin your life, resolve to remain cheerful and upbeat. As Victor Franklwrote in his best selling book, Logotherapy , “The last great freedom\nof mankind is the freedom to choose your attitude under any set of\nexternal conditions.”\nRefuse to complain about your problems. Keep them to yourself. As\nspeaker/humorist Ed Forman says, “You should never share your\nproblems with others because 80% of people don't care about them\nanyway, and the other 20% are kind of glad that you've got them in\nthe first place.”\nDevelop",

You must develop a routine of coaching yourself andencouraging yourself to play at the top of your game.\nMost of your emotions, positive or negative, are determined by how\nyou talk to yourself on a minute-to-minute basis. It is not what\nhappens to you but the way that you interpret the things that are\nhappening to you that determines how you feel. It is your version of\nevents that largely determines whether they motivate or demotivateyou, whether they energize or de-energize you.\nTo keep yourself motivated, you must resolve to become a complete\noptimist . You must determine to respond positively to the words,\nactions and reactions of the people and situations around you. Youmust refuse to let the unavoidable difficulties and setbacks of daily\nlife affect your mood or emotions.\nControl Your Inner Dialogue\nYour level of self-esteem, how much you like and respect yourself,",

Optimistic people\nseem to be more effective in almost every area of life.\nIt turns out that optimists have three special behaviors, all learned\nthrough practice and repetition. First, optimists look for the good  in\nevery situation. No matter what goes wrong, they always look for\nsomething good or beneficial. And not surprisingly, they always\nseem to find it.\nSecond, optimists always seek the valuable lesson in every setback\nor difficulty. They believe that , ”difficulties come not to obstruct, but to\ninstruct.”  They believe that each setback or obstacle contains a\nvaluable lesson they can learn and grow from, and they are\ndetermined to find it.\nThird, optimists always look for the solution to every problem.\nInstead of blaming or complaining when things go wrong, they\nbecome action oriented. They ask questions like, \"What's the\nsolution? What can we do now? What's the next step?\"\nThird, optimists think and talk continually about their goals . They\nthink about what they want and how to get it, most of the time. They\nthink and talk about the future and where they are going rather than\nthe past and where they came from. They are always looking forward\nrather than backward.\nWhen you continually visualize your goals and ideals and talk to\nyourself in a positive way, you feel more focused and energized. You\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 95feel more confident and creative. You experience a greater sense of\ncontrol and personal power.\nAnd the more positive and motivated you feel, the more eager you\nare to get started and the more determined you are to keep going.\nEat That Frog!\n1.  Control your thoughts. Remember, you become what you think\nabout most of the time. Be sure that you are thinking and talking\nabout the things you want rather than the things you",
