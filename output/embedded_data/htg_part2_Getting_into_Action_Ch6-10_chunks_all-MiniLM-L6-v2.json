The second tool for planning your \ntime continues where the Goals Statement leaves off. It helps \nyou decide on specific activities that you can do now to help \nyou achieve your long-term goals. \nYou cannot do a goal. Long-term planning and goal-setting \nmust therefore be complemented by short-term planning. \nThis kind of planning requires specifying activities. You can \ndo an activity. Activities are steps along the way to a goal. \nLet's say you desire security. Putting $10.00 in the bank or \ntalking to your stockbroker about your investment plans are \nactivities that will move you toward your goal. \nWhen you have planned well on both long-term and short-\nterm levels, then goals and activities fit together like well-\nmeshed gears. Most if not all of the activities specified in \nshort-term plans will contribute to the realization of the goals \nspecified in long-term plans. \nHow to List Activities Toward Your A-Goals \nIf you wish to accomplish such goals as happiness, success, \nor financial independence, an immense number and variety of \nactions are of course possible. Suppose you just want to enjoy \nyourself tonight. I bet you could list twenty-five or fifty ways \nto do it without even including anything fattening or illegal. \nThe same is true of any goal, no matter how crucial or \ntrivial. \nTo determine the right activities for achieving your A-\ngoals you must (1) list the possible activities for each A-goal, \nand (2) set priorities to allow you to select the most effective \nactivity to do now. \n37 \n38 ALAN LAKE IN \nIn listing activities, be as imaginative as possible. Quickly \nwrite down as many ideas as you can—it's a good way to get \ncreative juices flowing. Trying for quantity and speed will \nallow your intuition to operate. Your perceptions will come \ndirectly, unfiltered by your reasoning processes. Also, the \npressure of having to list activities will crease new insights. \nThe speed also allows you to run right past your inhibitions, \nbecause you simply don't give them a chance to operate. The \nimportant part of the Listing Activities exercise is to keep \nwriting. You're wasting your time if your pen or pencil point \nis not moving across the paper. \nDo not make any attempt to evaluate or censor your ideas \nyet. This list is for your personal benefit only. If you attempt \nto hide anything, you'll be fooling only yourself. It's impor­\ntant not to characterize activities as \"good\" or \"bad\" or \n\"frivolous\"—at least not while you're listing them. We'll \ncatch the less significant activities later when we prune the \nchoices. \nAlso, don't handcuff yourself by the thought that you \nmight not be able to do a particular activity. It may turn out, \nupon analysis, that you can do an activity even if at first \nblush it seems difficult or impossible. Just reserve judgment \nfor the present \nAnd don't let the fear bother you that once you list an ac­\ntivity you will have to do it. No one is going to force you to \ndo it. When you set priorities you may decide that the re­\nquired time and effort indicate that the activity is not worth \nthe time and effort required. But even impossible dreams may \nhave some future usefulness. \nIf you run out of activities to list, you might try repeating \na previous entry. Try variations on a theme, reactions to pre­\nvious entries, extensions, additions, implications, reactions, \ngreater or lesser detail, broader or narrower focus. The im­\nportant thing is to keep writing! \nSuppose your goal is to become an expert mountain climb­\ner. List all the mountains you might climb in order to \nachieve your goal, including the seemingly impossible \ndreams: the Matterhorn and Mount Everest. Perhaps your \ninterest lies in conquering only North American peaks? Euro­\npean? Asian? Breaking activities down by categories, sub­\ncategories, and sub-sub-categories can help. The important \nthing is to keep writing. \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 39 \nWhile Fve encouraged you to list as many activities as you \ncan without censoring or inhibiting the responses you put on \npaper, I do have one caution: Don't confuse goals with activ­\nities. Remember, an activity is something that can be done. \nYour goal might be to live a healthier life. The specific activ­\nities that might contribute to this end could be not eating \ndessert tonight, exercising three times this week, and giving \nup smoking for twenty-four hours. \nNow you're ready to make",

    "text": "6. GET STARTED RIGHT NOW \nTHE LIFETIME GOALS STATEMENT helps bring your future \ninto the present by giving you a clearer view of what your \nideal future looks like. The second tool for planning your \ntime continues where the Goals Statement leaves off. It helps \nyou decide on specific activities that you can do now to help \nyou achieve your long-term goals. \nYou cannot do a goal. Long-term planning and goal-setting \nmust therefore be complemented by short-term planning. \nThis kind of planning requires specifying activities. You can \ndo an activity. Activities are steps along the way to a goal. \nLet's say you desire security. Putting $10.00 in the bank or \ntalking to your stockbroker about your investment plans are \nactivities that will move you toward your goal. \nWhen you have planned well on both long-term and short-\nterm levels, then goals and activities fit together like well-\nmeshed gears. Most if not all of the activities specified in \nshort-term plans will contribute to the realization of the goals \nspecified in long-term plans. \nHow to List Activities Toward Your A-Goals \nIf you wish to accomplish such goals as happiness, success, \nor financial independence, an immense number and variety of \nactions are of course possible. Suppose you just want to enjoy \nyourself tonight. I bet you could list twenty-five or fifty ways \nto do it without even including anything fattening or illegal. \nThe same is true of any goal, no matter how crucial or \ntrivial. \nTo determine the right activities for achieving your A-\ngoals you must (1) list the possible activities for each A-goal, \nand (2) set priorities to allow you to select the most effective \nactivity to do now. \n37 \n38 ALAN LAKE IN \nIn listing activities, be as imaginative as possible. Quickly \nwrite down as many ideas as you can—it's a good way to get \ncreative juices flowing. Trying for quantity and speed will \nallow your intuition to operate. Your perceptions will come \ndirectly, unfiltered by your reasoning processes. Also, the \npressure of having to list activities will crease new insights. \nThe speed also allows you to run right past your inhibitions, \nbecause you simply don't give them a chance to operate. The \nimportant part of the Listing Activities exercise is to keep \nwriting. You're wasting your time if your pen or pencil point \nis not moving across the paper.",

You're wasting your time if your pen or pencil point \nis not moving across the paper. \nDo not make any attempt to evaluate or censor your ideas \nyet. This list is for your personal benefit only. If you attempt \nto hide anything, you'll be fooling only yourself. It's impor­\ntant not to characterize activities as \"good\" or \"bad\" or \n\"frivolous\"—at least not while you're listing them. We'll \ncatch the less significant activities later when we prune the \nchoices. \nAlso, don't handcuff yourself by the thought that you \nmight not be able to do a particular activity. It may turn out, \nupon analysis, that you can do an activity even if at first \nblush it seems difficult or impossible. Just reserve judgment \nfor the present \nAnd don't let the fear bother you that once you list an ac­\ntivity you will have to do it. No one is going to force you to \ndo it. When you set priorities you may decide that the re­\nquired time and effort indicate that the activity is not worth \nthe time and effort required. But even impossible dreams may \nhave some future usefulness. \nIf you run out of activities to list, you might try repeating \na previous entry. Try variations on a theme, reactions to pre­\nvious entries, extensions, additions, implications, reactions, \ngreater or lesser detail, broader or narrower focus. The im­\nportant thing is to keep writing! \nSuppose your goal is to become an expert mountain climb­\ner. List all the mountains you might climb in order to \nachieve your goal, including the seemingly impossible \ndreams: the Matterhorn and Mount Everest. Perhaps your \ninterest lies in conquering only North American peaks? Euro­\npean? Asian? Breaking activities down by categories, sub­\ncategories, and sub-sub-categories can help. The important \nthing is to keep writing. \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 39 \nWhile Fve encouraged you to list as many activities as you \ncan without censoring or inhibiting the responses you put on \npaper, I do have one caution: Don't confuse goals with activ­\nities. Remember, an activity is something that can be done. \nYour goal might be",

You're wasting your time if your pen or pencil point \nis not moving across the paper. \nDo not make any attempt to evaluate or censor your ideas \nyet. This list is for your personal benefit only. If you attempt \nto hide anything, you'll be fooling only yourself. It's impor­\ntant not to characterize activities as \"good\" or \"bad\" or \n\"frivolous\"—at least not while you're listing them. We'll \ncatch the less significant activities later when we prune the \nchoices. \nAlso, don't handcuff yourself by the thought that you \nmight not be able to do a particular activity. It may turn out, \nupon analysis, that you can do an activity even if at first \nblush it seems difficult or impossible. Just reserve judgment \nfor the present \nAnd don't let the fear bother you that once you list an ac­\ntivity you will have to do it. No one is going to force you to \ndo it. When you set priorities you may decide that the re­\nquired time and effort indicate that",

When you set priorities you may decide that the re­\nquired time and effort indicate that the activity is not worth \nthe time and effort required. But even impossible dreams may \nhave some future usefulness. \nIf you run out of activities to list, you might try repeating \na previous entry. Try variations on a theme, reactions to pre­\nvious entries, extensions, additions, implications, reactions, \ngreater or lesser detail, broader or narrower focus. The im­\nportant thing is to keep writing! \nSuppose your goal is to become an expert mountain climb­\ner. List all the mountains you might climb in order to \nachieve your goal, including the seemingly impossible \ndreams: the Matterhorn and Mount Everest. Perhaps your \ninterest lies in conquering only North American peaks? Euro­\npean? Asian? Breaking activities down by categories, sub­\ncategories, and sub-sub-categories can help. The important \nthing is to keep writing. \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 39 \nWhile Fve encouraged you to list as many activities",

    "text": " to live a healthier life. The specific activ­\nities that might contribute to this end could be not eating \ndessert tonight, exercising three times this week, and giving \nup smoking for twenty-four hours. \nNow you're ready to make your list. Take three fresh \nsheets of paper and write one of the A-goals selected earlier \nat the top of each. We're going to break your goals down \ninto do-able activities. Keeping in mind the above instruc­\ntions, spend three minutes making as long a list as possible of \nactivities that could conceivably contribute toward achieving \nthe first A-goal. Then spend three minutes each to list activi­\nties for the second and third A-goals. Go back over the three \nlists of activities, spending a mininum of three minutes on \neach list, adding, deleting, consolidating, refining, and even \ninventing further activities. Identify as many activities as you \ncan. \nLet's take the case of a high school sophomore who wants \nto be a professional baseball player. This is an A-goal for \nhim. But he also wants to go to college, another A-goal. And \nhe has a third A-goal that is more immediate: He wants to \nbe the starting pitcher on his varsity team. The latter A-goal \nis most immediate. To accomplish it hell keep in shape \nthrough the winter, running a mile every day and throwing \nindoors in the gym three times a week so that he'll be ready \nwhen spring comes. To make sure that he'll be accepted by \nthe college of his choice (let's say USC, which has always \nhad great baseball teams), hell keep up his studies. Preparing \nfor an important math exam this week is an A-activity. And, \nof course, putting forth his best effort in a championship \ngame is an A-activity toward his A-goal of being a major-\nleague ballplayer. \nA classic example is the woman who wants to return to \nwork. Her three children are now in school and she has some \nfree time. She worked as a nurse before her marriage twelve \nyears ago. To reach her A-l goal of returning to work she \nhas a number of A-activities she can do: taking refresher \ncourses to help her catch up on what's been happening, talk­\ning with other nurses about recent developments, making sure \n40 ALAN LAKE IN \nthat she*s satisfied all the current requirements, seeing what \nopenings are available and how they fit into her schedule. \nAnother good example is a person who is just graduating \nfrom college. His long-term goals include living a happy life \nand earning a comfortable income. But there's also the \nshorter-term goal of finding the right career. And that comes \ndown to finding a job. The A-activities for now include decid­\ning what occupational areas to look into, talking to people in \nvarious fields that interest him, preparing a resume^ writing \nletters, making a selection, and finally going to and schedul­\ning interviews. \nOne client I had felt he was wasting an enormous amount \nof time. He said, \"I'm very unhappy in my job. I'm an insur­\nance salesman but I really feel I belong in public relations. \nI'm busy looking for a job every coffee break I get, and each \nlunchtime I'm on the telephone calling people and telling \nthem what I'm looking for.\" \nIt turned out that he had talked to five people in the past \nmonth, and those were the same five people he had talked to \nthe month before. In short, he was getting nowhere fast. To \nfind a new job in a competitive field like public relations he \nmight have to contact fifty people a month, at a minimum. \nHe should continually be trying new people as the old people \ndid not pay off. This was his A-activity. \nEliminate Low-Priority Tasks \nIf you were conscientious in listing lots of possible A-activ­\nities you should now have too many activities and not enough \ntime for all of them. The time has come for you to set priori­\nties: to switch from being creative and imaginative to being \npractical and realistic. The way to start is by spotting and \neliminating low-priority items. \nFor each activity on each list ask yourself: Am I commit­\nted to spending a minimum of five minutes (or less if it can \nbe completely finished in less time) on this activity in the \nnext seven days? If the answer is \"no,\" draw a line through \nthe activity. \nYou don't have to offer any particular reason for crossing \nan activity off your list. You may not feel like doing it. It \nmay depend on someone else who cannot help you in the \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 41",

The specific activ­\nities that might contribute to this end could be not eating \ndessert tonight, exercising three times this week, and giving \nup smoking for twenty-four hours. \nNow you're ready to make your list. Take three fresh \nsheets of paper and write one of the A-goals selected earlier \nat the top of each. We're going to break your goals down \ninto do-able activities. Keeping in mind the above instruc­\ntions, spend three minutes making as long a list as possible of \nactivities that could conceivably contribute toward achieving \nthe first A-goal. Then spend three minutes each to list activi­\nties for the second and third A-goals. Go back over the three \nlists of activities, spending a mininum of three minutes on \neach list, adding, deleting, consolidating, refining, and even \ninventing further activities. Identify as many activities as you \ncan. \nLet's take the case of a high school sophomore who wants \nto be a professional baseball player. This is an A-goal for \nhim. But he also wants to go to college, another A-goal. And \nhe has a third A-goal that is more immediate: He wants to \nbe the starting pitcher on his varsity team. The latter A-goal \nis most immediate. To accomplish it hell keep in shape \nthrough the winter, running a mile every day and throwing \nindoors in the gym three times a week so that he'll be ready \nwhen spring comes. To make sure that he'll be accepted by \nthe college of his choice (let's say USC, which has always \nhad great baseball teams), hell keep up his studies. Preparing \nfor an important math exam this week is an A-activity. And, \nof course, putting forth his best effort in a championship \ngame is an A-activity toward his A-goal of being a major-\nleague ballplayer. \nA classic example is the woman who wants to return to \nwork. Her three children are now in school and she has some \nfree time. She worked as a nurse before her marriage twelve \nyears ago. To reach her A-l goal of returning to work she \nhas a number of A-activities she can do: taking refresher \ncourses to help her catch up on what's been happening, talk­\ning with other nurses about recent developments, making sure \n40 ALAN LAKE IN \nthat she*s",

The specific activ­\nities that might contribute to this end could be not eating \ndessert tonight, exercising three times this week, and giving \nup smoking for twenty-four hours. \nNow you're ready to make your list. Take three fresh \nsheets of paper and write one of the A-goals selected earlier \nat the top of each. We're going to break your goals down \ninto do-able activities. Keeping in mind the above instruc­\ntions, spend three minutes making as long a list as possible of \nactivities that could conceivably contribute toward achieving \nthe first A-goal. Then spend three minutes each to list activi­\nties for the second and third A-goals. Go back over the three \nlists of activities, spending a mininum of three minutes on \neach list, adding, deleting, consolidating, refining, and even \ninventing further activities. Identify as many activities as you \ncan. \nLet's take the case of a high school sophomore who wants \nto be a professional baseball player. This is an A-goal for \nhim. But he also wants to go to college, another A-goal. And \nhe has a third A-goal that is more immediate",

His long-term goals include living a happy life \nand earning a comfortable income. But there's also the \nshorter-term goal of finding the right career. And that comes \ndown to finding a job. The A-activities for now include decid­\ning what occupational areas to look into, talking to people in \nvarious fields that interest him, preparing a resume^ writing \nletters, making a selection, and finally going to and schedul­\ning interviews. \nOne client I had felt he was wasting an enormous amount \nof time. He said, \"I'm very unhappy in my job. I'm an insur­\nance salesman but I really feel I belong in public relations. \nI'm busy looking for a job every coffee break I get, and each \nlunchtime I'm on the telephone calling people and telling \nthem what I'm looking for.\" \nIt turned out that he had talked to five people in the past \nmonth, and those were the same five people he had talked to \nthe month before. In short, he was getting nowhere fast. To \nfind a new job in a competitive field like public relations he \nmight have to contact fifty people a month, at a minimum. \nHe should continually be trying new people as the old people \ndid not pay off. This was his A-activity. \nEliminate Low-Priority Tasks \nIf you were conscientious in listing lots of possible A-activ­\nities you should now have too many activities and not enough \ntime for all of them. The time has come for you to set priori­\nties: to switch from being creative and imaginative to being \npractical and realistic. The way to start is by spotting and \neliminating low-priority items. \nFor each activity on each list ask yourself: Am I commit­\nted to spending a minimum of five minutes (or less if it can \nbe completely finished in less time) on this activity in the \nnext seven days?

It \nmay depend on someone else who cannot help you in the \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 41 \nnext week. It may be too hard. Perhaps you're too busy this \nweek. Leave only what you are committed to starting for five \nminutes (and possibly finishing) in the next seven days. \nIf you have eliminated almost everything from your list, go \nback, taking as much time as you need, and come up with at \nleast four items you consider meaningful and which you will \nput time into in the next week. \nDon't be concerned about eliminating large or important \nitems (like getting a new job) from your list. If you don't \nwant to tackle it now, draw a line right through the item so \nit doesn't clutter things up. You can consider it again next \nweek. \nAfter you've pruned all three A-goal activity lists, combine \nthe results into one list. This list will contain perhaps a dozen \nor so activities that are important and that you are willing to \nput time into during the coming week. The next step is to set \npriorities. Classify the most important activity as A-l, the \nbest use of your time. Other A-activities should be numbered \naccordingly A-2, A-3, A-4. With these priorities in mind, set \ndeadlines for the various activities and schedule them into the \nnext seven days. If you go to a night school class three eve­\nnings, that leaves only two weekday possibilities to have din­\nner out. Which day will it be? And if you are going to start \nreading War and Peace, when will you start? Perhaps com­\nmuting on the train to work? Make a note of such decisions \non your list \nPick a Priority for Now \nHow can you move closer to your lifetime goals? Each day \nprovides a fresh opportunity. Select at least one A-activity to \nwork on right away and do it. You now have the beginning \nof an action program for achieving your lifetime goals. \nInitially, when you select the A-activity to work on each \nday, make it as short and as feasible as possible. If the A-ac­\ntivity you have selected seems too overwhelming, divide it \ninto smaller segments, then begin with the easiest part, or the \none that involves the least problems, or the one you value the \nmost. \nOnce you've singled out and defined this one task, you've \ngiven yourself a clear priority for the day. In the sixteen \n42 ALAN LAKE IN \nhours or so that you're awake each day, you can find a few \nminutes to work toward fulfilling an important lifetime goal. \nHow about starting now? \nThe Lifetime Goals chapter and this chapter are funda­\nmental to good time management For quick review, here are \nthe essential points: (1) List possible long-term goals; (2) set \npriorities for now and identify A-goals; (3) list possible ac­\ntivities for A-goals; (4) set priorities and identify A-activities \nfor now; (5) schedule the A-activities; (6) do them as \nscheduled. \n7. HOW SCHEDULING HELPS \nIF YOU FELT overwhelmed before, you may feel doubly so \nnow that you already have added the A-activities for now to \nwhatever else you have been doing already. Presumably, you \nstill want to do everything you did before (wash the dishes, \ngo to work, shop), but now you want to do even more (the \nA-activities you identified in the previous chapter). \nTo find a way out of this dilemma put your lifetime goals \nin the background for a few minutes and start at the other \nend of the time scale. What do you have to do today? \nObviously, you need time for essential activities such as \neating and sleeping, and while the amount nf time you allo­\ncate to them may be variable, there are minimums necessary \nfor normal functioning. Unless you are independently wealthy \nor have someone to support you, you will have to work to \nbring in money for food, clothing, and housing. This means \ndressing, grooming, commuting, and being on the job—all \nnecessary and all time-consuming. \nThen you need time for routine tasks: getting out of bed \nin the morning, reading the morning paper, opening the mail, \ngoing to weekly staff meetings, keeping your work area or­\nderly, watching television, washing dishes, chauffeuring the \nchildren. The routine tasks are determined by your position \nin an organization, family ties, civic responsibilities, social \nobligations, and the like. \nEssential activities and routine tasks are everyday",

It \nmay depend on someone else who cannot help you in the \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 41 \nnext week. It may be too hard. Perhaps you're too busy this \nweek. Leave only what you are committed to starting for five \nminutes (and possibly finishing) in the next seven days. \nIf you have eliminated almost everything from your list, go \nback, taking as much time as you need, and come up with at \nleast four items you consider meaningful and which you will \nput time into in the next week. \nDon't be concerned about eliminating large or important \nitems (like getting a new job) from your list. If you don't \nwant to tackle it now, draw a line right through the item so \nit doesn't clutter things up. You can consider it again next \nweek. \nAfter you've pruned all three A-goal activity lists, combine \nthe results into one list. This list will contain perhaps a dozen \nor so activities that are important and that you are willing to \nput time into during the coming week. The next step is to set \npriorities. Classify the most important activity as A-l, the \nbest use of your time. Other A-activities should be numbered \naccordingly A-2, A-3, A-4. With these priorities in mind, set \ndeadlines for the various activities and schedule them into the \nnext seven days. If you go to a night school class three eve­\nnings, that leaves only two weekday possibilities to have din­\nner out. Which day will it be? And if you are going to start \nreading War and Peace, when will you start? Perhaps com­\nmuting on the train to work? Make a note of such decisions \non your list \nPick a Priority for Now \nHow can you move closer to your lifetime goals? Each day \nprovides a fresh opportunity. Select at least one A-activity to \nwork on right away and do it. You now have the beginning \nof an action program for achieving your lifetime goals. \nInitially, when you select the A-activity to work on each \nday, make it as short and as feasible as possible. If the A-ac­\ntivity you have selected seems too overwhelming, divide it \ninto smaller segments, then begin with the easiest part,",

If the A-ac­\ntivity you have selected seems too overwhelming, divide it \ninto smaller segments, then begin with the easiest part, or the \none that involves the least problems, or the one you value the \nmost. \nOnce you've singled out and defined this one task, you've \ngiven yourself a clear priority for the day. In the sixteen \n42 ALAN LAKE IN \nhours or so that you're awake each day, you can find a few \nminutes to work toward fulfilling an important lifetime goal. \nHow about starting now? \nThe Lifetime Goals chapter and this chapter are funda­\nmental to good time management For quick review, here are \nthe essential points: (1) List possible long-term goals; (2) set \npriorities for now and identify A-goals; (3) list possible ac­\ntivities for A-goals; (4) set priorities and identify A-activities \nfor now; (5) schedule the A-activities; (6) do them as \nscheduled. \n7. HOW SCHEDULING HELPS \nIF YOU FELT overwhelmed before, you may feel doubly so \nnow that you already have added the A-activities for now to \nwhatever else you have been doing already. Presumably, you \nstill want to do everything you did before (wash the dishes, \ngo to work, shop), but now you want to do even more (the \nA-activities you identified in the previous chapter). \nTo find a way out of this dilemma put your lifetime goals \nin the background for a few minutes and start at the other \nend of the time scale. What do you have to do today? \nObviously, you need time for essential activities such as \neating and sleeping, and while the amount nf time you allo­\ncate to them may be variable, there are minimums necessary \nfor normal functioning. Unless you are independently wealthy \nor have someone to support you, you will have to work to \nbring in money for food, clothing, and housing. This means \ndressing, grooming, commuting, and being on the job—all \nnecessary and all time-consuming. \nThen you need time for routine tasks: getting out of bed \nin the morning, reading the morning paper, opening the mail, \ngoing to weekly staff meetings, keeping your work area or­\nderly, watching",

HOW SCHEDULING HELPS \nIF YOU FELT overwhelmed before, you may feel doubly so \nnow that you already have added the A-activities for now to \nwhatever else you have been doing already. Presumably, you \nstill want to do everything you did before (wash the dishes, \ngo to work, shop), but now you want to do even more (the \nA-activities you identified in the previous chapter). \nTo find a way out of this dilemma put your lifetime goals \nin the background for a few minutes and start at the other \nend of the time scale. What do you have to do today? \nObviously, you need time for essential activities such as \neating and sleeping, and while the amount nf time you allo­\ncate to them may be variable, there are minimums necessary \nfor normal functioning. Unless you are independently wealthy \nor have someone to support you, you will have to work to \nbring in money for food, clothing, and housing. This means \ndressing, grooming, commuting, and being on the job—all \nnecessary",

    "text": " television, washing dishes, chauffeuring the \nchildren. The routine tasks are determined by your position \nin an organization, family ties, civic responsibilities, social \nobligations, and the like. \nEssential activities and routine tasks are everyday motions \nthat you don't normally think much about, and yet they fill \nup much of your day. In fact, they can easily preempt your \nlife! \nOne secretary complained to me that she never had time \nfor special tasks that her boss wanted her to do and that she \nparticularly enjoyed. After our discussion she realized the \ntrouble: She spent her whole day on routine duties the boss \nhad asked her to do the day she was hired—answering the \n43 \n44 ALAN LAKE IN \ntelephone, taking dictation, doing the filing, showing people \ninto the office, answering questions, maintaining the station­\nery inventories. Her routine work load was so heavy that she \nwasn't able to absorb fun assignments. This is often true of \nhomemakers, also. \nRecognize that you may be doing all you can by working \nvery hard and conscientiously just to keep up with these \nroutine tasks—if that is your choice. \nToday's tasks are also preordained to some extent by what \nis already in process: whatever got started yesterday, last \nweek, or last month. It includes activities scheduled on a reg­\nular basis as well as commitments for which you have made \nspecial appointments. A celebrated author who was an over­\nnight success with his first book received many invitations in \nthe year following his acclaim. Even though he would have \nloved to have a free day to spend with his family, or to begin \nwork on a new book, he was committed months in advance \nto speeches, lectures, and TV appearances. On any given day \nhe couldn't decide to sleep late or stay home and read a \nbook. You too may find much of your time taken up by com­\nmitments made long ago. \nUnexpected interruptions and crises make still further— \nand often annoying—demands on your time. You wake up to \ndiscover you left the headlights on last night and the battery \nis dead, so instead of getting into the office fifteen minutes \nearly to catch up on some of your work, you find yourself ar­\nriving two hours late. You learn that Mr. Jones has called \nfive times to complain that the gizmo you promised him yes­\nterday still hasn't arrived, so you have to rush around like \nmad to expedite delivery. \nEssential activities, routine tasks and previous commit­\nments coupled with interruptions and crises, can wipe out \nanybody's dream of having a few minutes to pursue a life­\ntime goal. But they don't have to wipe it out It all depends \non how well you recognize (and deal with) these inevitable \ntime-consumers and whether you are prepared to make time \nfor yourself. I know of no other way: To increase the likeli­\nhood of accomplishing important lifetime goals, you've got to \nplan your time each and every day. \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 45 \n\"Who's Got Time for Planning?\" \nNo matter how busy you are, you should always take the \ntime to plan. The less time you feel you have to spare, the \nmore important it is to plan your time carefully. Spend only \nten minutes at the beginning or end of the day planning, and \nit will repay your efforts many times over. \nSometimes you will be so busy that you'll feel you really \ndon't have time to plan. O.K., maybe you don't have time to \nplan and do absolutely everything else you'd like to get out of \nthe way. But think about this: By failing to plan, you will \nfree very little if any time, and by failing to plan you will al­\nmost certainly fail to discriminate among ABC's. Even if you \nare confining yourself to doing A's, you still might not do the \nbest A's. Therefore, although you think you never have time \nto plan when you are busy, you always come out ahead by \ninvesting time in planning anyway. Yes, I mean it: Exactly \nbecause we lack time to plan, we should take time to plan. \nPlanning is usually done best first thing in the morning or \nat the end of the day. There are many advantages to plan­\nning in the morning when you are fresh. You gain momen­\ntum as you go along. Having just thought about what you \nhave to do, you move easily to getting it done. With the day's \npriorities clearly in mind you are less likely to be sidetracked \nas you go along. \nThe advantage of planning in the evening is that you know \nwhere you have come from and this perspective",

The routine tasks are determined by your position \nin an organization, family ties, civic responsibilities, social \nobligations, and the like. \nEssential activities and routine tasks are everyday motions \nthat you don't normally think much about, and yet they fill \nup much of your day. In fact, they can easily preempt your \nlife! \nOne secretary complained to me that she never had time \nfor special tasks that her boss wanted her to do and that she \nparticularly enjoyed. After our discussion she realized the \ntrouble: She spent her whole day on routine duties the boss \nhad asked her to do the day she was hired—answering the \n43 \n44 ALAN LAKE IN \ntelephone, taking dictation, doing the filing, showing people \ninto the office, answering questions, maintaining the station­\nery inventories. Her routine work load was so heavy that she \nwasn't able to absorb fun assignments. This is often true of \nhomemakers, also. \nRecognize that you may be doing all you can by working \nvery hard and conscientiously just to keep up with these \nroutine tasks—if that is your choice. \nToday's tasks are also preordained to some extent by what \nis already in process: whatever got started yesterday, last \nweek, or last month. It includes activities scheduled on a reg­\nular basis as well as commitments for which you have made \nspecial appointments. A celebrated author who was an over­\nnight success with his first book received many invitations in \nthe year following his acclaim. Even though he would have \nloved to have a free day to spend with his family, or to begin \nwork on a new book, he was committed months in advance \nto speeches, lectures, and TV appearances. On any given day \nhe couldn't decide to sleep late or stay home and read a \nbook. You too may find much of your time taken up by com­\nmitments made long ago. \nUnexpected interruptions and crises make still further— \nand often annoying—demands on your time. You wake up to \ndiscover you left the headlights on last night and the battery \nis dead, so instead of getting into the office fifteen minutes \nearly to catch up on some of your work, you find yourself ar­\nriving two hours late. You learn that Mr. Jones has called \nfive times to complain that the gizmo you",

The routine tasks are determined by your position \nin an organization, family ties, civic responsibilities, social \nobligations, and the like. \nEssential activities and routine tasks are everyday motions \nthat you don't normally think much about, and yet they fill \nup much of your day. In fact, they can easily preempt your \nlife! \nOne secretary complained to me that she never had time \nfor special tasks that her boss wanted her to do and that she \nparticularly enjoyed. After our discussion she realized the \ntrouble: She spent her whole day on routine duties the boss \nhad asked her to do the day she was hired—answering the \n43 \n44 ALAN LAKE IN \ntelephone, taking dictation, doing the filing, showing people \ninto the office, answering questions, maintaining the station­\nery inventories. Her routine work load was so heavy that she \nwasn't able to absorb fun assignments. This is often true of \nhomemakers, also. \nRecognize that you may be doing all you can by working \nvery hard and conscientiously just to keep up with these \nroutine tasks—if that is your choice. \nToday's tasks",

It includes activities scheduled on a reg­\nular basis as well as commitments for which you have made \nspecial appointments. A celebrated author who was an over­\nnight success with his first book received many invitations in \nthe year following his acclaim.

On any given day \nhe couldn't decide to sleep late or stay home and read a \nbook. You too may find much of your time taken up by com­\nmitments made long ago. \nUnexpected interruptions and crises make still further— \nand often annoying—demands on your time.

    "text": " instead of getting into the office fifteen minutes \nearly to catch up on some of your work, you find yourself ar­\nriving two hours late. You learn that Mr. Jones has called \nfive times to complain that the gizmo you promised him yes­\nterday still hasn't arrived, so you have to rush around like \nmad to expedite delivery. \nEssential activities, routine tasks and previous commit­\nments coupled with interruptions and crises, can wipe out \nanybody's dream of having a few minutes to pursue a life­\ntime goal. But they don't have to wipe it out It all depends \non how well you recognize (and deal with) these inevitable \ntime-consumers and whether you are prepared to make time \nfor yourself. I know of no other way: To increase the likeli­\nhood of accomplishing important lifetime goals, you've got to \nplan your time each and every day. \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 45 \n\"Who's Got Time for Planning?\" \nNo matter how busy you are, you should always take the \ntime to plan. The less time you feel you have to spare, the \nmore important it is to plan your time carefully. Spend only \nten minutes at the beginning or end of the day planning, and \nit will repay your efforts many times over. \nSometimes you will be so busy that you'll feel you really \ndon't have time to plan. O.K., maybe you don't have time to \nplan and do absolutely everything else you'd like to get out of \nthe way. But think about this: By failing to plan, you will \nfree very little if any time, and by failing to plan you will al­\nmost certainly fail to discriminate among ABC's. Even if you \nare confining yourself to doing A's, you still might not do the \nbest A's. Therefore, although you think you never have time \nto plan when you are busy, you always come out ahead by \ninvesting time in planning anyway. Yes, I mean it: Exactly \nbecause we lack time to plan, we should take time to plan. \nPlanning is usually done best first thing in the morning or \nat the end of the day. There are many advantages to plan­\nning in the morning when you are fresh. You gain momen­\ntum as you go along. Having just thought about what you \nhave to do, you move easily to",

But they don't have to wipe it out It all depends \non how well you recognize (and deal with) these inevitable \ntime-consumers and whether you are prepared to make time \nfor yourself.

    "text": " getting it done. With the day's \npriorities clearly in mind you are less likely to be sidetracked \nas you go along. \nThe advantage of planning in the evening is that you know \nwhere you have come from and this perspective helps you se­\nlect activities for tomorrow. Also, if you have your day all \nset when you arrive the next morning, you don't have to \ndebate what to do and consequently waste time. Another \nadvantage is that your unconscious can work overnight on \ndeveloping ideas so that you arrive at work all primed for \naction. \nThe distinctly different benefits of morning and evening \nplanning are both worth taking advantage of. So I suggest \nyou plan in the morning as well as in the evening. \nCan you afford the time? I have had several clients keep \ncareful track of how much time they spent on various activi­\nties during the week. They were conscientious people con­\ncerned about time and planning, more so than the average \n46 ALAN LAKE IN \nperson. They were convinced of the importance of planning \nand committed to spending as much time as necessary on it. \nThey found that all of their planning time came to less than \nfour hours a week. They concluded that it really doesn't take \nlong to plan—considerably less than an hour a day—but the \nresults are substantial: more A-l's get done, less trivia inter­\nferes. Planning kept them focused on the important things. \nSome executives I know have made it a rule not to leave \ntheir offices until they have the next day's plan on their desks. \nA further extension would be to come in fifteen minutes early \nthe next morning and sharpen up that plan. (Of course as in­\nterruptions and crises come up during the day, still further \nadjustments must be made.) \nI do almost all my planning early in the morning. As hard \nas I try, I can't seem to average more than three and a half \nhours a week at it. I wake up around 5 A.M., before anyone \nelse in the house, and I put this quiet time into my most im­\nportant activity—planning. \nEvery morning as part of my planning effort, I look at my \nLifetime Goals list and identify specific A-activities I can do \ntoday to move ahead toward those lifetime goals. The rest of \nthe time before breakfast I spend doing A-activities. Finish­\ning this book is one such activity and a lot of this work got \ndone before my family got up. \nI recommend using Friday afternoon for reviewing the \nweek, planning the following week's projects in a general way \nbut those you'll do on Monday in detail. Use Monday morn­\ning for refining your plan and starting your A-goals of the \nweek. \nHow to Block Out A-Time \nOne of the main planning tools I emphasize is scheduling. \nBut scheduling means more than just fitting into the hours \navailable all the things you must do: meetings, appointments, \ndeadlines. It means also making time for what you want to \ndo—your A's. \nIn laying out a weekly schedule the key is to block out \ntime for the A's that require a lot of time. Schedule large-\nenough blocks of time to build up momentum. Reserve par­\nticular days of the week (say, Tuesday and Thursday morn-\nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 4\" \nings) for major projects. Even if your day is fragmented by \ninterruptions, you can still attempt to keep blocks of time in­\ntact for the high-value A's. \nTo find more time for the A's, set aside a special A-time \neach day and firmly banish all C-items during this period. To \ncreate a block of time for A's to get done, start small and al­\nlocate, for example, fifteen minutes each day to use exclu­\nsively for A-items. You can gradually increase this time for \nthe A-items as you grow more comfortable with the idea of \nputting first things first. \nTry blocking A-time horizontally on a weekly calendar—at \nthe same time each day, say, Monday through Friday, 9:30-\n10:30 A.M. You can also block vertically down the page—say \nreserving Wednesday afternoon from 2-4 P.M. as A-time for \nthis week's A-project. \nOne husband, whose wife was in the habit of accepting \nmany dates for them to go out and who felt he didn't have \nenough time to be alone with her, went through her calendar \nand wrote \"busy'' alongside all the Tuesday nights. When she \nwas asked out for that date, she looked on the calendar and \nfound that she was \"busy.\" He thus freed A-time to spend \nalone",

    "text": " getting it done. With the day's \npriorities clearly in mind you are less likely to be sidetracked \nas you go along. \nThe advantage of planning in the evening is that you know \nwhere you have come from and this perspective helps you se­\nlect activities for tomorrow. Also, if you have your day all \nset when you arrive the next morning, you don't have to \ndebate what to do and consequently waste time. Another \nadvantage is that your unconscious can work overnight on \ndeveloping ideas so that you arrive at work all primed for \naction. \nThe distinctly different benefits of morning and evening \nplanning are both worth taking advantage of. So I suggest \nyou plan in the morning as well as in the evening. \nCan you afford the time? I have had several clients keep \ncareful track of how much time they spent on various activi­\nties during the week. They were conscientious people con­\ncerned about time and planning, more so than the average \n46 ALAN LAKE IN \nperson. They were convinced of the importance of planning \nand committed to spending as much time as necessary on it. \nThey found that all of their planning time came to less than \nfour hours a week. They concluded that it really doesn't take \nlong to plan—considerably less than an hour a day—but the \nresults are substantial: more A-l's get done, less trivia inter­\nferes. Planning kept them focused on the important things. \nSome executives I know have made it a rule not to leave \ntheir offices until they have the next day's plan on their desks. \nA further extension would be to come in fifteen minutes early \nthe next morning and sharpen up that plan. (Of course as in­\nterruptions and crises come up during the day, still further \nadjustments must be made.) \nI do almost all my planning early in the morning. As hard \nas I try, I can't seem to average more than three and a half \nhours a week at it. I wake up around 5 A.M., before anyone \nelse in the house, and I put this quiet time into my most im­\nportant activity—planning. \nEvery morning as part of my planning effort, I look at my \nLifetime Goals list and identify specific A-activities I can do \ntoday to move ahead toward those lifetime goals. The rest of \nthe time before breakfast I spend doing A",

They were convinced of the importance of planning \nand committed to spending as much time as necessary on it. \nThey found that all of their planning time came to less than \nfour hours a week. They concluded that it really doesn't take \nlong to plan—considerably less than an hour a day—but the \nresults are substantial: more A-l's get done, less trivia inter­\nferes. Planning kept them focused on the important things. \nSome executives I know have made it a rule not to leave \ntheir offices until they have the next day's plan on their desks. \nA further extension would be to come in fifteen minutes early \nthe next morning and sharpen up that plan. (Of course as in­\nterruptions and crises come up during the day, still further \nadjustments must be made.) \nI do almost all my planning early in the morning. As hard \nas I try, I can't seem to average more than three and a half \nhours a week at it. I wake up around 5 A.M., before anyone \nelse in the house, and I put this quiet time into my most im­\nportant activity—planning",

The rest of \nthe time before breakfast I spend doing A-activities. Finish­\ning this book is one such activity and a lot of this work got \ndone before my family got up. \nI recommend using Friday afternoon for reviewing the \nweek, planning the following week's projects in a general way \nbut those you'll do on Monday in detail. Use Monday morn­\ning for refining your plan and starting your A-goals of the \nweek. \nHow to Block Out A-Time \nOne of the main planning tools I emphasize is scheduling. \nBut scheduling means more than just fitting into the hours \navailable all the things you must do: meetings, appointments, \ndeadlines. It means also making time for what you want to \ndo—your A's. \nIn laying out a weekly schedule the key is to block out \ntime for the A's that require a lot of time. Schedule large-\nenough blocks of time to build up momentum. Reserve par­\nticular days of the week (say, Tuesday and Thursday morn-\nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 4\" \nings) for major projects. Even if your day is fragmented by \ninterruptions, you can still attempt to keep blocks of time in­\ntact for the high-value A's. \nTo find more time for the A's, set aside a special A-time \neach day and firmly banish all C-items during this period. To \ncreate a block of time for A's to get done, start small and al­\nlocate, for example, fifteen minutes each day to use exclu­\nsively for A-items. You can gradually increase this time for \nthe A-items as you grow more comfortable with the idea of \nputting first things first. \nTry blocking A-time horizontally on a weekly calendar—at \nthe same time each day, say, Monday through Friday, 9:30-\n10:30 A.M. You can also block vertically down the page—say \nreserving Wednesday afternoon from 2-4 P.M. as A-time for \nthis week's A-project. \nOne husband, whose wife was in the habit of accepting \nmany dates for them to go out and who felt he didn't have \nenough time to be alone with her",

Even if your day is fragmented by \ninterruptions, you can still attempt to keep blocks of time in­\ntact for the high-value A's. \nTo find more time for the A's, set aside a special A-time \neach day and firmly banish all C-items during this period. To \ncreate a block of time for A's to get done, start small and al­\nlocate, for example, fifteen minutes each day to use exclu­\nsively for A-items. You can gradually increase this time for \nthe A-items as you grow more comfortable with the idea of \nputting first things first. \nTry blocking A-time horizontally on a weekly calendar—at \nthe same time each day, say, Monday through Friday, 9:30-\n10:30 A.M. You can also block vertically down the page—say \nreserving Wednesday afternoon from 2-4",

    "text": ", went through her calendar \nand wrote \"busy'' alongside all the Tuesday nights. When she \nwas asked out for that date, she looked on the calendar and \nfound that she was \"busy.\" He thus freed A-time to spend \nalone with her. \nI've read articles in management literature suggesting that \nthe way to get hold of your time is to record what you do \nevery minute 24 hours a day, 168 hours a week. I emphati­\ncally disagree with this approach; not only is it time-con­\nsuming and burdensome to keep track of all your time, but \nI'm convinced that it's a waste of time. Suppose you feel the \nneed to make a change in your eating habits. You already \nknow intuitively that you ought to reduce the quantity of \nfried foods and add a little more protein and a few fresh veg­\netables to help balance your diet. It would be a waste of time \nto keep track of every single item you eat before deciding \nwhat to change. On the other hand, keeping a daily record of \nthe fried foods and vegetables you eat during a month can \nsignificantly help you decrease the fried foods and increase \nthe vegetables. You immediately gain the benefits of better \nhealth, and you're freed from the drudgery of spending a \nmonth keeping track of everything you eat Likewise with \ntime. I feel it's much better to watch your time selectively, \nkeeping track of particular problem items which you feel are \nconsuming an inordinate amount of time. \n48 ALAN LAKE IN \nIn my experience, people who try to report everything find \nit so hopelessly complicated that they give up in despair \nwithin a couple of days without having made any changes. I \nbelieve that recordkeeping for sake of recordkeeping has very \nlittle value, but that selective recordkeeping for the sake of \ninfluencing the way you do a particular task has a great deal \nof value. \nMake a Time Change \nJust as you make a diet change, so you can make a time \nchange. If you feel there's too much work time in your life \nand not enough family and personal time, start quitting when \neverybody else does and-stop working overtime; start schedul­\ning more weekends with your family. \nToo much golf and not enough civic activities? You don't \nneed any complicated time-accounting to get you to cut back \non the golf. Too much housekeeping and not enough time for \ncreative pursuits? Let the dust accumulate for a day or two. \nYou don't want to recordkeep but you do want to schedule \nyour time, because you can find a great deal of time through \ncareful scheduling of whatever you really want to do. \nRemember: There is always enough time for the important \nthings. The busiest people are able to find time for what they \nwant to do, not because they have any more time than others \nbut because they think in terms of \"making\" time by careful \nscheduling. \nTrying to do the same thing at the same time each day \nboth conserves and generates energy. It conserves energy by \ncutting down on indecision. You perform menial tasks by \nrote. It generates energy through habit—the habit of expect­\ning to make phone calls, plan the meals, read the paper, at­\ntend a class, or go to a meeting—all at a particular time. \nYou Have Two Kinds of Prime Time \nAnother very important aspect of scheduling is \"prime\" \ntime. Internal prime time is the time when you work best— \nmorning, afternoon, or evening. External prime time is the \nbest time to attend to other people—those you have to deal \nwith in your job, your social life, and at home. \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 49 \nInternal prime time is the time when you concentrate best. \nI know early birds who never get a good idea after 7 A.M. \nand night owls who are most creative between 10 P.M. and \nmidnight. If you had to pick the two hours of the day when \nyou think most clearly, which would you pick? From 10 A.M. \nto 12 noon? From 4 P.M. to 6 P.M.? The two hours that you \nselect are probably your own internal prime time, but during \nthe next two weeks you might check to see whether your \nconcentration really is best during those hours. \nTry to save all your internal prime time for prime projects. \nMost business people pick the first couple of hours at \nwork as their internal prime time, yet this is usually the time \nthey read the newspaper, answer routine mail, get yesterday's \nunanswered telephone calls out of the way, and talk to col­\nleagues and subordinates. It's much better to save such \nroutine tasks",

When she \nwas asked out for that date, she looked on the calendar and \nfound that she was \"busy.\" He thus freed A-time to spend \nalone with her. \nI've read articles in management literature suggesting that \nthe way to get hold of your time is to record what you do \nevery minute 24 hours a day, 168 hours a week. I emphati­\ncally disagree with this approach; not only is it time-con­\nsuming and burdensome to keep track of all your time, but \nI'm convinced that it's a waste of time. Suppose you feel the \nneed to make a change in your eating habits. You already \nknow intuitively that you ought to reduce the quantity of \nfried foods and add a little more protein and a few fresh veg­\netables to help balance your diet. It would be a waste of time \nto keep track of every single item you eat before deciding \nwhat to change. On the other hand, keeping a daily record of \nthe fried foods and vegetables you eat during a month can \nsignificantly help you decrease the fried foods and increase \nthe vegetables. You immediately gain the benefits of better \nhealth, and you're freed from the drudgery of spending a \nmonth keeping track of everything you eat Likewise with \ntime. I feel it's much better to watch your time selectively, \nkeeping track of particular problem items which you feel are \nconsuming an inordinate amount of time. \n48 ALAN LAKE IN \nIn my experience, people who try to report everything find \nit so hopelessly complicated that they give up in despair \nwithin a couple of days without having made any changes. I \nbelieve that recordkeeping for sake of recordkeeping has very \nlittle value, but that selective recordkeeping for the sake of \ninfluencing the way you do a particular task has a great deal \nof value. \nMake a Time Change \nJust as you make a diet change, so you can make a time \nchange. If you feel there's too much work time in your life \nand not enough family and personal time, start quitting when \neverybody else does and-stop working overtime; start schedul­\ning more weekends with your family. \nToo much golf and not enough civic activities? You don't \nneed any complicated time-accounting to get you to cut back \non the golf. Too much",

On the other hand, keeping a daily record of \nthe fried foods and vegetables you eat during a month can \nsignificantly help you decrease the fried foods and increase \nthe vegetables. You immediately gain the benefits of better \nhealth, and you're freed from the drudgery of spending a \nmonth keeping track of everything you eat Likewise with \ntime. I feel it's much better to watch your time selectively, \nkeeping track of particular problem items which you feel are \nconsuming an inordinate amount of time. \n48 ALAN LAKE IN \nIn my experience, people who try to report everything find \nit so hopelessly complicated that they give up in despair \nwithin a couple of days without having made any changes. I \nbelieve that recordkeeping for sake of recordkeeping has very \nlittle value, but that selective recordkeeping for the sake of \ninfluencing the way you do a particular task has a great deal \nof value. \nMake a Time Change \nJust as you make a diet change, so you can make a time \nchange. If you feel there's too much work time in your life \nand not enough family and personal time, start quitting when \neverybody else does",

You don't \nneed any complicated time-accounting to get you to cut back \non the golf. Too much housekeeping and not enough time for \ncreative pursuits? Let the dust accumulate for a day or two. \nYou don't want to recordkeep but you do want to schedule \nyour time, because you can find a great deal of time through \ncareful scheduling of whatever you really want to do. \nRemember: There is always enough time for the important \nthings. The busiest people are able to find time for what they \nwant to do, not because they have any more time than others \nbut because they think in terms of \"making\" time by careful \nscheduling. \nTrying to do the same thing at the same time each day \nboth conserves and generates energy. It conserves energy by \ncutting down on indecision. You perform menial tasks by \nrote. It generates energy through habit—the habit of expect­\ning to make phone calls, plan the meals, read the paper, at­\ntend a class, or go to a meeting—all at a particular time. \nYou Have Two Kinds of Prime Time \nAnother very important aspect of scheduling is \"prime\" \ntime. Internal prime time is the time when you work best— \nmorning, afternoon, or evening. External prime time is the \nbest time to attend to other people—those you have to deal \nwith in your job, your social life, and at home. \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 49 \nInternal prime time is the time when you concentrate best. \nI know early birds who never get a good idea after 7 A.M. \nand night owls who are most creative between 10 P.M. and \nmidnight. If you had to pick the two hours of the day when \nyou think most clearly, which would you pick? From 10 A.M. \nto 12 noon? From 4 P.M. to 6 P.M.? The two hours that you \nselect are probably your own internal prime time, but during \nthe next two weeks you might check to see whether your \nconcentration really is best during those hours. \nTry to save all your internal prime time for prime projects. \nMost business people pick the first couple of hours at \nwork as their internal prime time, yet",

You don't \nneed any complicated time-accounting to get you to cut back \non the golf. Too much housekeeping and not enough time for \ncreative pursuits? Let the dust accumulate for a day or two. \nYou don't want to recordkeep but you do want to schedule \nyour time, because you can find a great deal of time through \ncareful scheduling of whatever you really want to do. \nRemember: There is always enough time for the important \nthings. The busiest people are able to find time for what they \nwant to do, not because they have any more time than others \nbut because they think in terms of \"making\" time by careful \nscheduling. \nTrying to do the same thing at the same time each day \nboth conserves and generates energy. It conserves energy by \ncutting down on indecision. You perform menial tasks by \nrote. It generates energy through habit—the habit of expect­\ning to make phone calls, plan the meals, read the paper, at­\ntend a class, or go to a meeting—all at a particular time. \n",

It generates energy through habit—the habit of expect­\ning to make phone calls, plan the meals, read the paper, at­\ntend a class, or go to a meeting—all at a particular time. \nYou Have Two Kinds of Prime Time \nAnother very important aspect of scheduling is \"prime\" \ntime. Internal prime time is the time when you work best— \nmorning, afternoon, or evening. External prime time is the \nbest time to attend to other people—those you have to deal \nwith in your job, your social life, and at home. \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 49 \nInternal prime time is the time when you concentrate best. \nI know early birds who never get a good idea after 7 A.M. \nand night owls who are most creative between 10 P.M. and \nmidnight. If you had to pick the two hours of the day when \nyou think most clearly, which would you pick? From 10 A.M. \nto 12 noon? From 4 P.M. to 6 P.M.? The two hours that you \nselect are probably your own internal prime time, but during \nthe next two weeks",

    "text": " this is usually the time \nthey read the newspaper, answer routine mail, get yesterday's \nunanswered telephone calls out of the way, and talk to col­\nleagues and subordinates. It's much better to save such \nroutine tasks for non-prime hours. \nOne housewife experienced a great spurt of energy after \nher husband and kids left the house. She rushed around \nmadly making beds, washing dishes, doing the laundry, pick­\ning up toys, so that by 11 she had gotten all of her house­\nwork out of the way. Then she collapsed until 2:30, when it \nwas time to pick up her children at school. Her intentions \nwere excellent: She thought that if she got all her repulsive \nchores out of the way she would have lots of free time for \ncandlemaking, a part-time income-producing project she en­\njoyed doing. But she found she was too tired after her chores \nto do her own-time things. Since she had the house all \nstraightened up by 11, she was also reluctant to take out all \nher equipment and spread it all over the place and make a \nmess again. The result was that she felt she didn't have \nenough time for candlemaking. As an outsider I was quickly \nable to see that she was making a basic scheduling mistake. \nThe simple change of reversing her candlemaking and house-\ncleaning activities netted her two hours of prime time for her \ncandlemaking project. \nThe chemical research analyst who spent the afternoon \nskimming through professional publications for recent de­\nvelopments in his field and completing routine administrative \nforms was making the same mistake, but he did it in reverse. \nHe was a late starter, and really got going after lunch. When \nhe switched his routine chores to the morning, he had the af­\nternoon free to do the more creative part of his job. \n50 ALAN LAKEIN \nExternal prime time is when external resources (usually \npeople) are most readily available for decisions, inquiries, \nand information. It's the time when you can catch the boss \nfor that needed decision before he leaves for a week's busi­\nness trip. Salesmen recognize that their external prime time \nruns from 9 to 5—the hours when they meet face to face \nwith their customers. So they schedule routine matters for \nbefore or after that period. \nIt's important to make sure in advance that you're going to \nbe able to see the people you have to. The housewife will \nhave to make appointments to see the dentist, the doctor, and \nher hairdresser. She knows when the stores she uses for shop­\nping open and close. She's in touch with other mothers about \nthe scheduling of next week's car pool to get the kids to \nschool. \nThe executive makes sure that when he places a phone call \nhe has a high chance of finding that the person he needs on \nthe other end is available. He has to know when his col­\nleagues are free for consultation—and he should plan to take \nadvantage of that time. \nMost people aren't very good at putting themselves into \nthe other fellow's shoes, and therefore aren't very good at \nthinking in terms of another person's schedule. Yet there are \nbig dividends when you do so. One executive I know spends \nextended periods with his boss during the lunch hour because \nhe knows the boss rarely goes out. They have a sandwich in \nthe office without being interrupted, since everyone else is \nout to lunch. \nAnother choice time to catch the boss might be just a \nshade after he comes in, as he is taking off his hat and coat \nand before he has a chance to get immersed in other things. \nFor Effective Scheduling—Stay Loose \nFlexibility is needed to accommodate whatever situation \nmay arise. If you fill up every moment in advance with ap­\npointments, without any breaks except for lunch, you are \nbound to go home frustrated, nervous, and tense. \nThe unexpected happenings need their time, too. Even with \na light schedule in prospect, the incoming mail, visitors, and \ntelephone may put enough demands on your time to create \nan overload. Experience will tell you that although you may \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 51 \nnot be able to anticipate specifics, there will be interruptions \nand distractions during the day that will take up your time. \nYou need some slack time to handle whatever unexpected \ncrises and opportunities come your way during the day. \nTherefore, always reserve at least an hour a day of \nuncommitted time. Leave holes in your schedule for recovery \nfrom a long interview, and set aside time enough to read the \nmail and catch up on paperwork. Try to get absolute musts \nout of the way early in the day so you",

It's much better to save such \nroutine tasks for non-prime hours. \nOne housewife experienced a great spurt of energy after \nher husband and kids left the house. She rushed around \nmadly making beds, washing dishes, doing the laundry, pick­\ning up toys, so that by 11 she had gotten all of her house­\nwork out of the way. Then she collapsed until 2:30, when it \nwas time to pick up her children at school. Her intentions \nwere excellent: She thought that if she got all her repulsive \nchores out of the way she would have lots of free time for \ncandlemaking, a part-time income-producing project she en­\njoyed doing. But she found she was too tired after her chores \nto do her own-time things. Since she had the house all \nstraightened up by 11, she was also reluctant to take out all \nher equipment and spread it all over the place and make a \nmess again. The result was that she felt she didn't have \nenough time for candlemaking. As an outsider I was quickly \nable to see that she was making a basic scheduling mistake. \nThe simple change of reversing her candlemaking and house-\ncleaning activities netted her two hours of prime time for her \ncandlemaking project. \nThe chemical research analyst who spent the afternoon \nskimming through professional publications for recent de­\nvelopments in his field and completing routine administrative \nforms was making the same mistake, but he did it in reverse. \nHe was a late starter, and really got going after lunch. When \nhe switched his routine chores to the morning, he had the af­\nternoon free to do the more creative part of his job. \n50 ALAN LAKEIN \nExternal prime time is when external resources (usually \npeople) are most readily available for decisions, inquiries, \nand information. It's the time when you can catch the boss \nfor that needed decision before he leaves for a week's busi­\nness trip. Salesmen recognize that their external prime time \nruns from 9 to 5—the hours when they meet face to face \nwith their customers. So they schedule routine matters for \nbefore or after that period. \nIt's",

    "text": "uncommitted time. Leave holes in your schedule for recovery \nfrom a long interview, and set aside time enough to read the \nmail and catch up on paperwork. Try to get absolute musts \nout of the way early in the day so you will feel less frantic \nabout interruptions and distractions. \nRigidity in setting and following demanding schedules with­\nout variation creates the feeling of being regimented by the \nclock, and living your whole life with a constant eye on the \nclock can be unpleasant. A proper balance of scheduled and \nunscheduled time carefully planned and then used well can \nhelp you get your life flowing more smoothly with fewer fits \nand starts. \n8. HOW TO FIND TIME \nYOU NEVER KNEW YOU HAD \nMANY PEOPLE \"on the way up\" allow their family and \npersonal lives to be heavily impinged upon by work demands. \nOthers are so achievement-oriented that they feel guilty tak­\ning time out for anything that is not in some way related to \ntheir work. \nHorror stories abound of men who work so hard that they \nhardly ever see their families and who end up with ulcers and \nheart trouble. One study several years ago of successful and \nunsuccessful executives indicated that many men who ulti­\nmately fail had made their personal lives expendable to their \njobs. \nMy experience with clients has convinced me that when ex­\necutives find themselves on a treadmill they tend to lose per­\nspective of what's important. They spend time unnecessarily \non secondary matters and let many important ones go un­\ndone. This often tends to be cumulative. The more overtime \nthey put in, the more exhausted—and the less efficient—they \nbecome. The answer is not to spend more hours on the proj­\nect but to work more effectively within the time allotted. \nI recall one architect who came to me suffering from too \nmuch work and not enough play. He had only recently recov­\nered from a bleeding ulcer and again was working sixty hours \na week. His complaint was that he never had time to see his \nwife and young children. I suggested that he take off at noon \non Friday and, since summer was just beginning, take his \nfamily away to his favorite spot at Lake Tahoe. He rented a \ncabin, where he and his family spent each weekend during \nthe summer. Not surprisingly, he fell in love again with his \nwife, got to know his children, and his health improved. Since \nhe knew that he couldn't make up for low productivity by \nlong hours, he concentrated on getting the important things \ndone in the time he had. He actually got more done than he \never had working sixty hours, even though he shaved more \n52 \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 53 \nthan fifteen hours off that total. As a bonus, he got some of \nhis most creative ideas while he was relaxing at the lake, so \nhis leisure time paid off handsomely. All he really lost by cut­\nting back those fifteen hours was the detailed drafting that he \ncompulsively had felt the need to do himself. He delegated it \nto a draftsman. \nCan you work effectively if you are too fatigued from ex­\ncessive hours? Probably not. Maybe a better solution would \nbe to quit early, take the afternoon and evening off, and \ncome back the next day refreshed and physically able to \nwork twice as hard. \nGet More Done by Doing Nothing \nI think you will find that if you arrange things so that you \nfind time to relax and \"do nothing,\" you will get more done \nand have more fun doing it. \nOne client, an aerospace engineer, didn't know how to \"do \nnothing.\" Every minute of his leisure time was scheduled with \nintense activity. He had an outdoop-activities schedule in \nwhich he switched from skiing and ice hockey to water-skiing \nand tennis. His girlfriend kept up with him in these activities, \nalthough she would have preferred just to sit by the fire and \nrelax once in a while. Like too many people, he felt the need \nto be doing something all the time—doing nothing seemed a \nwaste of time. His \"relaxing by the fire\" consisted of playing \nchess, reading Scientific American, or playing bridge. Even \nhis lovemaking was on a tight schedule. \nFor an experiment I asked him to \"waste\" his time for five \nminutes during one of our sessions together. What he ended \nup doing was relaxing, sitting quietly and daydreaming. When \nhe was finally able to admit that emotional reasons caused \nhim to reject relaxing as a waste of time, he began to look \nmore critically at that assumption. Once he accepted the fact \nthat relaxing was a good use of time, he became less com­\npulsive about being busy and",

    "text": "uncommitted time. Leave holes in your schedule for recovery \nfrom a long interview, and set aside time enough to read the \nmail and catch up on paperwork. Try to get absolute musts \nout of the way early in the day so you will feel less frantic \nabout interruptions and distractions. \nRigidity in setting and following demanding schedules with­\nout variation creates the feeling of being regimented by the \nclock, and living your whole life with a constant eye on the \nclock can be unpleasant. A proper balance of scheduled and \nunscheduled time carefully planned and then used well can \nhelp you get your life flowing more smoothly with fewer fits \nand starts. \n8. HOW TO FIND TIME \nYOU NEVER KNEW YOU HAD \nMANY PEOPLE \"on the way up\" allow their family and \npersonal lives to be heavily impinged upon by work demands. \nOthers are so achievement-oriented that they feel guilty tak­\ning time out for anything that is not in some way related to \ntheir work. \nHorror stories abound of men who work so hard that they \nhardly ever see their families and who end up with ulcers and \nheart trouble. One study several years ago of successful and \nunsuccessful executives indicated that many men who ulti­\nmately fail had made their personal lives expendable to their \njobs. \nMy experience with clients has convinced me that when ex­\necutives find themselves on a treadmill they tend to lose per­\nspective of what's important. They spend time unnecessarily \non secondary matters and let many important ones go un­\ndone. This often tends to be cumulative. The more overtime \nthey put in, the more exhausted—and the less efficient—they \nbecome. The answer is not to spend more hours on the proj­\nect but to work more effectively within the time allotted. \nI recall one architect who came to me suffering from too \nmuch work and not enough play. He had only recently recov­\nered from a bleeding ulcer and again was working sixty hours \na week. His complaint was that he never had time to see his \nwife and young children. I suggested that he take off at noon \non Friday and, since summer was just beginning, take his \nfamily away to his favorite spot at Lake Tahoe. He rented a \ncabin, where he and his family spent each weekend during \nthe summer. Not surprisingly, he fell in love again with his \nwife, got to know his children",

Not surprisingly, he fell in love again with his \nwife, got to know his children, and his health improved. Since \nhe knew that he couldn't make up for low productivity by \nlong hours, he concentrated on getting the important things \ndone in the time he had. He actually got more done than he \never had working sixty hours, even though he shaved more \n52 \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 53 \nthan fifteen hours off that total. As a bonus, he got some of \nhis most creative ideas while he was relaxing at the lake, so \nhis leisure time paid off handsomely. All he really lost by cut­\nting back those fifteen hours was the detailed drafting that he \ncompulsively had felt the need to do himself. He delegated it \nto a draftsman. \nCan you work effectively if you are too fatigued from ex­\ncessive hours? Probably not. Maybe a better solution would \nbe to quit early, take the afternoon and evening off, and \ncome back the next day refreshed and physically able to \nwork twice as hard. \nGet More Done by Doing Nothing \nI think you will find that if you arrange things so that you \nfind time to relax and \"do nothing,\" you will get more done \nand have more fun doing it. \nOne client, an aerospace engineer, didn't know how to \"do \nnothing.\" Every minute of his leisure time was scheduled with \nintense activity. He had an outdoop-activities schedule in \nwhich he switched from skiing and ice hockey to water-skiing \nand tennis. His girlfriend kept up with him in these activities, \nalthough she would have preferred just to sit by the fire and \nrelax once in a while. Like too many people, he felt the need \nto be doing something all the time—doing nothing seemed a \nwaste of time. His \"relaxing by the fire\" consisted of playing \nchess, reading Scientific American, or playing bridge. Even \nhis lovemaking was on a tight schedule. \nFor an experiment I asked him to \"waste\" his time for five \nminutes during one of our sessions together. What he ended \nup doing was relaxing, sitting quietly and daydreaming. When \nhe was finally able to admit that emotional reasons",

Maybe a better solution would \nbe to quit early, take the afternoon and evening off, and \ncome back the next day refreshed and physically able to \nwork twice as hard. \nGet More Done by Doing Nothing \nI think you will find that if you arrange things so that you \nfind time to relax and \"do nothing,\" you will get more done \nand have more fun doing it. \nOne client, an aerospace engineer, didn't know how to \"do \nnothing.\" Every minute of his leisure time was scheduled with \nintense activity. He had an outdoop-activities schedule in \nwhich he switched from skiing and ice hockey to water-skiing \nand tennis. His girlfriend kept up with him in these activities, \nalthough she would have preferred just to sit by the fire and \nrelax once in a while. Like too many people, he felt the need \nto be doing something all the time—doing nothing seemed a \nwaste of time. His \"relaxing by the fire\" consisted of playing \nchess, reading Scientific American, or playing bridge. Even \nhis lovemaking was on a tight schedule. \nFor",

    "text": " caused \nhim to reject relaxing as a waste of time, he began to look \nmore critically at that assumption. Once he accepted the fact \nthat relaxing was a good use of time, he became less com­\npulsive about being busy and started enjoying each activity \nmore. Previously he had been so busy doing that he had no \ntime to have fun at anything. He began to do less and have \nmore fun. When I saw him about three years later, he still \nhad as busy a schedule as ever, but he was able to balance \nthat activity with relaxing so that he came back to work \n54 ALAN LAKE IN \nMonday morning not pooped out from a strenuous weekend, \nbut refreshed. \nIn my opinion, nothing is a total waste of time, including \ndoing nothing at times. Anything can be carried to extremes, \nof course, and I recall one client who needed to be pepped \nup from his indifference to any activity. He rediscovered his \nenergy after we sat down with his unpaid bills and figured \nout how few days could go by before he'd find himself in \nserious trouble. \nSometimes the only way to get more leisure time is to re­\nduce arbitrarily the demands of the job. If your attempts to \nget more relaxation don't succeed, you may have to make \nsome basic changes in your work situation. A credit manager \nfor a men's-clothing store struggled overtime for two years. \nHe never could get his boss to let him have an assistant to \ntake over some of the details. He finally decided it was \nhopeless and found a job with another firm where he didn't \nhave to work eighty hours a week, and had more time to \nspend with his family. The chief accountant in the same firm \nsolved the same overload problem by deciding to do as much \nas he could and not worry about what didn't get done. His \nsolution was more successful: When the boss saw that the \nwork wasn't getting done, he let the chief accountant hire \nmore help. The credit manager would have been a lot hap­\npier if he had similarly confronted his boss's stubbornness— \nor changed his job sooner. He could have saved himself two \nyears of misery. \nThe Homemaker's Special Problem \nThe homemaker's problem of finding leisure time is partic­\nularly acute. The demands go on twenty-four hours a day, \nand such deadlines as getting a meal on the table or clothes \non the family's back are unyielding. Interruptions tend to be \ntraumatic; children get hurt or sick or need emotional help \nright now. Mother stays on the scene all the time. She can't \nturn off her job at 5 P.M. and come home to find dinner \nwaiting. The truth is that, with purchasing, budgeting, minor \nrepairs, husbandly complaints, family nutrition, keeping in­\nventory, deciding how many kids can wear this sweater or \nuse that bike—on top of the physical labor of it all—a \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 55 \nwoman is running a tough little business in which the respon­\nsibility is all hers. \nGiven all these problems, a homemaker must work espe­\ncially hard to find any leisure time for herself at all. The so­\nlution gets back to scheduling. She has to schedule time for \nherself on a regular basis. One homemaker arranged for \nsomeone to come in every Wednesday afternoon; she was a \ntheater buff and used Wednesday afternoons to go to a mat­\ninee when there was something she wanted to see. Other­\nwise, she had it free for museum or gallery visits, shopping, \nor seeing friends. \nI strongly recommend regularly scheduled free time for \nhomemakers. If you say, \"I'll take off some day or other this \nweek,\" something always comes up that interferes.

    "text": " caused \nhim to reject relaxing as a waste of time, he began to look \nmore critically at that assumption. Once he accepted the fact \nthat relaxing was a good use of time, he became less com­\npulsive about being busy and started enjoying each activity \nmore. Previously he had been so busy doing that he had no \ntime to have fun at anything. He began to do less and have \nmore fun. When I saw him about three years later, he still \nhad as busy a schedule as ever, but he was able to balance \nthat activity with relaxing so that he came back to work \n54 ALAN LAKE IN \nMonday morning not pooped out from a strenuous weekend, \nbut refreshed. \nIn my opinion, nothing is a total waste of time, including \ndoing nothing at times. Anything can be carried to extremes, \nof course, and I recall one client who needed to be pepped \nup from his indifference to any activity. He rediscovered his \nenergy after we sat down with his unpaid bills and figured \nout how few days could go by before he'd find himself in \nserious trouble. \nSometimes the only way to get more leisure time is to re­\nduce arbitrarily the demands of the job. If your attempts to \nget more relaxation don't succeed, you may have to make \nsome basic changes in your work situation. A credit manager \nfor a men's-clothing store struggled overtime for two years. \nHe never could get his boss to let him have an assistant to \ntake over some of the details. He finally decided it was \nhopeless and found a job with another firm where he didn't \nhave to work eighty hours a week, and had more time to \nspend with his family. The chief accountant in the same firm \nsolved the same overload problem by deciding to do as much \nas he could and not worry about what didn't get done. His \nsolution was more successful: When the boss saw that the \nwork wasn't getting done, he let the chief accountant hire \nmore help. The credit manager would have been a lot hap­\npier if he had similarly confronted his boss's stubbornness— \nor changed his job sooner. He could have saved himself two \nyears of misery. \nThe Homemaker's Special Problem \nThe homemaker's problem of finding leisure time is partic­\nularly acute. The demands go on twenty-four hours a day, \nand such deadlines as getting a meal",

Once he accepted the fact \nthat relaxing was a good use of time, he became less com­\npulsive about being busy and started enjoying each activity \nmore. Previously he had been so busy doing that he had no \ntime to have fun at anything. He began to do less and have \nmore fun. When I saw him about three years later, he still \nhad as busy a schedule as ever, but he was able to balance \nthat activity with relaxing so that he came back to work \n54 ALAN LAKE IN \nMonday morning not pooped out from a strenuous weekend, \nbut refreshed. \nIn my opinion, nothing is a total waste of time, including \ndoing nothing at times. Anything can be carried to extremes, \nof course, and I recall one client who needed to be pepped \nup from his indifference to any activity. He rediscovered his \nenergy after we sat down with his unpaid bills and figured \nout how few days could go by before he'd find himself in \nserious trouble. \nSometimes the only way to get more leisure time is to re­\nduce arbitrarily the demands of the job",

If your attempts to \nget more relaxation don't succeed, you may have to make \nsome basic changes in your work situation. A credit manager \nfor a men's-clothing store struggled overtime for two years. \nHe never could get his boss to let him have an assistant to \ntake over some of the details. He finally decided it was \nhopeless and found a job with another firm where he didn't \nhave to work eighty hours a week, and had more time to \nspend with his family. The chief accountant in the same firm \nsolved the same overload problem by deciding to do as much \nas he could and not worry about what didn't get done. His \nsolution was more successful: When the boss saw that the \nwork wasn't getting done, he let the chief accountant hire \nmore help. The credit manager would have been a lot hap­\npier if he had similarly confronted his boss's stubbornness— \nor changed his job sooner. He could have saved",

The demands go on twenty-four hours a day, \nand such deadlines as getting a meal on the table or clothes \non the family's back are unyielding. Interruptions tend to be \ntraumatic; children get hurt or sick or need emotional help \nright now. Mother stays on the scene all the time. She can't \nturn off her job at 5 P.M. and come home to find dinner \nwaiting. The truth is that, with purchasing, budgeting, minor \nrepairs, husbandly complaints, family nutrition, keeping in­\nventory, deciding how many kids can wear this sweater or \nuse that bike—on top of the physical labor of it all—a \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 55 \nwoman is running a tough little business in which the respon­\nsibility is all hers. \nGiven all these problems, a homemaker must work espe­\ncially hard to find any leisure time for herself at all. The so­\nlution gets back to scheduling. She has to schedule time for \nherself on a regular basis. One homemaker arranged for \nsomeone to come in every Wednesday afternoon; she was a \ntheater buff and used Wednesday afternoons to go to a mat­\ninee when there was something she wanted to see. Other­\nwise, she had it free for museum or gallery visits, shopping, \nor seeing friends. \nI strongly recommend regularly scheduled free time for \nhomemakers. If you say, \"I'll take off some day or other this \nweek,\" something always comes up that interferes. But set­\nting aside time on a particular day leads to the expectation of \nhaving that time and results in getting the time you want. \nOne homemaker I knew had a standing Thursday evening \ndate with her husband—to get out of the house, be free of \nthe cooking, and enjoy a restaurant meal as well as the \nrelaxed atmosphere. \nIf a homemaker is on the alert for external changes that \naffect her time, she can often find extra hours that she has \noverlooked. One woman had entered an Adult Extension \nclass on \"The Changing Role of Women in Society.\" She had \narranged for a babysitter and had gone each Tuesday after­\nnoon for several",

She knew weeks ahead when the \ncourse would be over, but she did not make any effort to \nschedule that time profitably for herself, and so she let the \nsitter go when the course ended. She could have furthered \nsome other lifetime goals in the time that was open for her \non Tuesdays. \nI find it a good idea on regular occasions to take a look \ntwo or three months ahead and ask what's on tap. What ad­\nvantage can you take of the time when the kids are in school, \nor when your associates are on vacation? Note what events \nwill influence your schedule in a major way: the semiannual \nnational sales conference, the deadline for the seasonal cata­\nlogue. What has to be done to allow for pickup of activity \nafter Labor Day? For people being away around Christmas? \nFor the seasonable winter blues in February—maybe a week­\nend in Bermuda or Mexico City? \nBy taking note of these situations well in advance, you can \n56 ALAN LAKE IN \noften make or find opportunities for furthering some of your \nmost important goals. \nMake the Most of Your Transition Time \nTve suggested that you need to balance work and play. \nAnd again you might say to me, \"But I don't have enough \ntime for everything.\" Well, again I say, \"Let's see if we can \nfind some time.\" More specifically, let's see if you can find \nsome time that you have previously overlooked. One kind of \ntime that is often overlooked is what I call \"transition time.\" \nThis kind of time starts when you awaken in the morning \nand ends when you begin your regular day's work. For most \npeople it amounts to about forty minutes a day, usually a bit \nlonger for women than men. One man I know has reduced it \nto fifteen minutes. He uses the time only to do essentials—eat \nbreakfast, shave, dress—and he does these as quickly as pos­\nsible. \nThere may be an advantage in extending rather than re­\nducing this transition time. If your day is broken into many \nparts, transition time offers you perhaps the only block of \ntime you'll have alone and undisturbed. It is a good time to \nreflect on the best use of your time during the coming day \nand to consider those time management techniques that will \nhelp you get things done. As I mentioned before, I get up \nearly—5 A.M.—and spend two hours of transition time plan­\nning the rest of the day and working on today's activities to \nfurther my lifetime goals. What is the right time to wake up \nin the morning? Almost every time you read about a busy, \nfamous man (Senator Dirksen was one I remember), he \nstarted with paperwork at 5 or 5:30 A.M. and had accom­\nplished mountains by the time the phones started ringing at \n9. \nThere are other ways to enrich transition time. The late \nRobert Kennedy was reported to have listened to Shake­\nspeare plays while shaving. One creative manager, realizing \nthat he got some of his best ideas in the morning, has come \nto expect them and \"catches\" them for further development \nwhile they—and he—are still fresh. This can also be hobby \ntime for jogging, painting, sculpting, reading, writing, or \nwhatever. \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 57 \nHow to Use Commuting Time \nIf you feel it takes you too long to get to work, have you \nconsidered moving closer? In most cases this is not practical, \nyet more often than you might suspect a person does have \nthe very real option of moving closer to his place of employ­\nment. If you're a professional person, how about working out \nof your house twice a week and skipping that forty-five min­\nute commute on the freeway? \nIf you drive to work you're limited in the use you can \nmake of the time you spend sitting in traffic jams. Safety \ncomes first. But you can also listen to the radio. You can \npractice that new vocabulary exercise. More and more car­\ntridge tapes on educational subjects are becoming available, \nso you might learn a foreign language, listen to a business re­\nport, or take a memory course. Commuting time offers a \nchance to preview and plan your day, though you should \ncrystallize that plan on paper as soon as you sit down at your \ndesk. \nHow to Use Coffee Breaks \nCoffee breaks can be a good time to relax. But suppose \nyou're not particularly tense or tired. How about learning a \nword from your dictionary? Writing that unpleasant but im­\nportant note to the bank telling them why your installment \npayment is late? Or calling your dentist for an appointment \n",

She knew weeks ahead when the \ncourse would be over, but she did not make any effort to \nschedule that time profitably for herself, and so she let the \nsitter go when the course ended. She could have furthered \nsome other lifetime goals in the time that was open for her \non Tuesdays. \nI find it a good idea on regular occasions to take a look \ntwo or three months ahead and ask what's on tap. What ad­\nvantage can you take of the time when the kids are in school, \nor when your associates are on vacation? Note what events \nwill influence your schedule in a major way: the semiannual \nnational sales conference, the deadline for the seasonal cata­\nlogue. What has to be done to allow for pickup of activity \nafter Labor Day? For people being away around Christmas? \nFor the seasonable winter blues in February—maybe a week­\nend in Bermuda or Mexico City? \nBy taking note of these situations well in advance, you can \n56 ALAN LAKE IN \noften make or find opportunities for furthering some of your \nmost important goals. \nMake the Most of Your Transition Time \nTve suggested that you need to balance work and play. \nAnd again you might say to me, \"But I don't have enough \ntime for everything.\" Well, again I say, \"Let's see if we can \nfind some time.\" More specifically, let's see if you can find \nsome time that you have previously overlooked. One kind of \ntime that is often overlooked is what I call \"transition time.\" \nThis kind of time starts when you awaken in the morning \nand ends when you begin your regular day's work. For most \npeople it amounts to about forty minutes a day, usually a bit \nlonger for women than men. One man I know has reduced it \nto fifteen minutes. He uses the time only to do essentials—eat \nbreakfast, shave, dress—and he does these as quickly as pos­\nsible. \nThere may be an advantage in extending rather than re­\nducing this transition time. If your day is broken into many \nparts, transition time offers you perhaps the only block of \ntime you'll have alone and undisturbed. It is a good time to \nreflect on the best use of your time during the coming day \nand to consider those time management techniques that will \nhelp you get things done. As I mentioned before,",

    "text": " well in advance, you can \n56 ALAN LAKE IN \noften make or find opportunities for furthering some of your \nmost important goals. \nMake the Most of Your Transition Time \nTve suggested that you need to balance work and play. \nAnd again you might say to me, \"But I don't have enough \ntime for everything.\" Well, again I say, \"Let's see if we can \nfind some time.\" More specifically, let's see if you can find \nsome time that you have previously overlooked. One kind of \ntime that is often overlooked is what I call \"transition time.\" \nThis kind of time starts when you awaken in the morning \nand ends when you begin your regular day's work. For most \npeople it amounts to about forty minutes a day, usually a bit \nlonger for women than men. One man I know has reduced it \nto fifteen minutes. He uses the time only to do essentials—eat \nbreakfast, shave, dress—and he does these as quickly as pos­\nsible. \nThere may be an advantage in extending rather than re­\nducing this transition time. If your day is broken into many \nparts, transition time offers you perhaps the only block of \ntime",

    "text": " you'll have alone and undisturbed. It is a good time to \nreflect on the best use of your time during the coming day \nand to consider those time management techniques that will \nhelp you get things done. As I mentioned before, I get up \nearly—5 A.M.—and spend two hours of transition time plan­\nning the rest of the day and working on today's activities to \nfurther my lifetime goals. What is the right time to wake up \nin the morning? Almost every time you read about a busy, \nfamous man (Senator Dirksen was one I remember), he \nstarted with paperwork at 5 or 5:30 A.M. and had accom­\nplished mountains by the time the phones started ringing at \n9. \nThere are other ways to enrich transition time. The late \nRobert Kennedy was reported to have listened to Shake­\nspeare plays while shaving. One creative manager, realizing \nthat he got some of his best ideas in the morning, has come \nto expect them and \"catches\" them for further development \nwhile they—and he—are still fresh. This can also be hobby \ntime for jogging, painting, sculpting, reading, writing, or \nwhatever. \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 57 \nHow to Use Commuting Time \nIf you feel it takes you too long to get to work, have you \nconsidered moving closer? In most cases this is not practical, \nyet more often than you might suspect a person does have \nthe very real option of moving closer to his place of employ­\nment. If you're a professional person, how about working out \nof your house twice a week and skipping that forty-five min­\nute commute on the freeway? \nIf you drive to work you're limited in the use you can \nmake of the time you spend sitting in traffic jams. Safety \ncomes first. But you can also listen to the radio. You can \npractice that new vocabulary exercise. More and more car­\ntridge tapes on educational subjects are becoming available, \nso you might learn a foreign language, listen to a business re­\nport, or take a memory course. Commuting time offers a \nchance to preview and plan your day, though you should \ncrystallize that plan on paper as soon as you sit down at your \ndesk. \nHow to Use Coffee Breaks \nCoffee breaks can be a good time to relax.

    "text": " you'll have alone and undisturbed. It is a good time to \nreflect on the best use of your time during the coming day \nand to consider those time management techniques that will \nhelp you get things done. As I mentioned before, I get up \nearly—5 A.M.—and spend two hours of transition time plan­\nning the rest of the day and working on today's activities to \nfurther my lifetime goals. What is the right time to wake up \nin the morning? Almost every time you read about a busy, \nfamous man (Senator Dirksen was one I remember), he \nstarted with paperwork at 5 or 5:30 A.M. and had accom­\nplished mountains by the time the phones started ringing at \n9. \nThere are other ways to enrich transition time. The late \nRobert Kennedy was reported to have listened to Shake­\nspeare plays while shaving. One creative manager, realizing \nthat he got some of his best ideas in the morning, has come \nto expect them and \"catches\" them for further development \nwhile they—and he—are still fresh. This can also be hobby \ntime for jogging, painting, sculpting, reading, writing, or \nwhatever. \n",

Writing that unpleasant but im­\nportant note to the bank telling them why your installment \npayment is late? Or calling your dentist for an appointment \nbefore that temporary filling falls out? \nThe True Price of Lunch \nIn some selling jobs, of course, the client is crucial, and in \nsuch a situation a working lunch may be beneficial. But by \nand large, a full-scale lunch is a fantastic waste of time. For \nmost people, lunch just adds calories and expenses they can \nwell do without. Many doctors today are dead set against \n\"Three square meals a day,\" and many first-rate M.D. diet \nspecialists either skip lunch altogether or have some cottage \ncheese and that's it \nLunch time offers a great time to get things done while the \nphones are quiet and others are busy. On the other hand, if \n58 ALAN LAKE IN \nyou have a hectic business day a lunch break may provide \nthe only breathing time for you. In that event, if you cut \nback on your lunch time you might decrease your effec­\ntiveness the rest of the day. Maybe this is a good time for \nyou to take a walk or a swim at the Y. \nA general merchandising manager, recently promoted, no \nlonger took a regular lunch time off. He felt that since his job \ninvolved more responsibility, he should be available all the \ntime, and so he just grabbed a quick sandwich on the run. \nAfter several weeks of this, he found himself irritable in the \nafternoon, snapping at his colleagues, and having difficulty \nconcentrating on important matters. I convinced him that he \nneeded a sit-down lunch to restore his energy and inner calm. \nSo he began having a more leisurely lunch and made certain \nthat nothing interfered with this mid-day break. He de­\nveloped the practice of going to lunch with a different person \neach day. Some were friends with whom he enjoyed a social \noccasion. But gradually he also lunched with all his subordi­\nnates and got to know them better. When he had to ask them \nto do something for him or when they were asking him for \nhelp, he had the benefit of personal relationships to support \nthose quick back-and-forth requests. \nHe was careful, even though he took a long lunch time, \nnot to eat too much, as he found it made him sleepy in the \nafternoon. But as this executive found out, what you eat \nmight not be nearly as important as who you eat with and \nwhat you talk about. \nHow to Use Waiting Time \nIf you have to wait for the subway, bus, or your car pool, \nyou can use those patches of time profitably, too. You might \nread the paper, but suppose you've had a lifelong goal of \nreading the classics. Most of them are available in paperback. \nYou may not always feel like reading Don Quixote as you \nwait for the bus at the corner of Main and Pine, but isn't it \nnice to have the option? \nWaiting time can also help solve that particularly tricky \nproblem that's been bothering you at work. Think it through \nsequentially. First, try outlining the problem step by step. \nThen, if you have more time, pick out an aspect that might \nbe thoroughly explored in, say, five minutes. You probably \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 59 \nwon't be able to solve the whole problem, but at least you \nhave the ball rolling. \nMake Yonr Sleep Work for Yon \nWhat time should you go to bed? If you decide to get up \nearly, does that mean you should go to bed early? The largest \nsingle block of time is sleep time. Are you sleeping your life \naway? Doctors have found that often many people spend \nmany hours in sleep for which there is no physical need. \nWhen these habits are changed and these people try to do \nwith less, they often find no difference in health or efficiency. \nYou might experiment with reducing your sleep time by, \nperhaps, half an hour. Give yourself a few days to get adjust­\ned to the new pattern. If you are as effective as you were \nbefore, you will gain the equivalent of a week of Sundays in \nthe course of a year. \nThere is great variation in sleep needs, not only between \none person and another, but also for each person. Weekend \npatterns usually are very different from weekday habits. And \nif you always stay up Tuesdays because that's your bowling \nnight, perhaps you've noticed that you're not unusually tired \nthe following day. \nIf you like, you can put some sleep time to work once you \nrealize that most body functions continue while you are \n",

Writing that unpleasant but im­\nportant note to the bank telling them why your installment \npayment is late? Or calling your dentist for an appointment \nbefore that temporary filling falls out? \nThe True Price of Lunch \nIn some selling jobs, of course, the client is crucial, and in \nsuch a situation a working lunch may be beneficial. But by \nand large, a full-scale lunch is a fantastic waste of time. For \nmost people, lunch just adds calories and expenses they can \nwell do without. Many doctors today are dead set against \n\"Three square meals a day,\" and many first-rate M.D. diet \nspecialists either skip lunch altogether or have some cottage \ncheese and that's it \nLunch time offers a great time to get things done while the \nphones are quiet and others are busy. On the other hand, if \n58 ALAN LAKE IN \nyou have a hectic business day a lunch break may provide \nthe only breathing time for you. In that event, if you cut \nback on your lunch time you might decrease your effec­\ntiveness the rest of the day. Maybe this is a good time for \nyou to take a walk or a swim at the Y. \nA general merchandising manager, recently promoted, no \nlonger took a regular lunch time off. He felt that since his job \ninvolved more responsibility, he should be available all the \ntime, and so he just grabbed a quick sandwich on the run. \nAfter several weeks of this, he found himself irritable in the \nafternoon, snapping at his colleagues, and having difficulty \nconcentrating on important matters. I convinced him that he \nneeded a sit-down lunch to restore his energy and inner calm. \nSo he began having a more leisurely lunch and made certain \nthat nothing interfered with this mid-day break. He de­\nveloped the practice of going to lunch with a different person \neach day. Some were friends with whom he enjoyed a social \noccasion. But gradually he also lunched with all his subordi­\nnates and got to know them better. When he had to ask them \nto do something for him or when they were asking him for \nhelp, he had the benefit of personal relationships to support \nthose quick back-and-forth requests. \nHe was careful, even though he took a long lunch time,",

Most of them are available in paperback. \nYou may not always feel like reading Don Quixote as you \nwait for the bus at the corner of Main and Pine, but isn't it \nnice to have the option? \nWaiting time can also help solve that particularly tricky \nproblem that's been bothering you at work. Think it through \nsequentially. First, try outlining the problem step by step. \nThen, if you have more time, pick out an aspect that might \nbe thoroughly explored in, say, five minutes.

Give yourself a few days to get adjust­\ned to the new pattern. If you are as effective as you were \nbefore, you will gain the equivalent of a week of Sundays in \nthe course of a year. \nThere is great variation in sleep needs, not only between \none person and another, but also for each person.

    "text": " because that's your bowling \nnight, perhaps you've noticed that you're not unusually tired \nthe following day. \nIf you like, you can put some sleep time to work once you \nrealize that most body functions continue while you are \nasleep. As your dreams show, your subconscious works while \nyou sleep. Why not deliberately put it to work on your tough \nproblems? Here's how: \nPose a question to your subconscious just before you fall \nasleep. Select one that requires hours of thought—after all, \nyour subconscious will have four to eight hours to work on it \nNow, don't waste time thinking about it consciously, but do \nexpect a meaningful answer when you awaken. Many who \nhave tried this method have found it successful. But if it only \nkeeps you awake, by all means forget it. \nWhat do you do if you have to put eight hours a day into \na job you don't like? Whether it's for a summer or a year, \nlet's say you have decided to stay at least temporarily in a \njob that is not satisfying. If you're simply working to bring in \nmoney, is there any way that you can do more than just \nmark time? \n60 ALAN LAKEIN \nI had a fascinating talk recently with a young man who is \na devoted fish breeder. He began breeding mollies at the age \nof ten and has worked his way up to breeding killifish. Proba­\nbly because of his strong hobby interest—he spends three \nhours every evening on his fish-breeding project—he has \nfound a very routine civil-service job. While he is filling out \nforms for the state, he also plans what he's going to do next \nabout his fish. For example, he recently decided to breed a \nrare species of killifish which had to be imported from Af­\nrica. These fish were being imported under the Endangered \nSpecies Act, and he did much thinking about how to breed \nthem successfully in his second-floor apartment, quite differ­\nent from their natural habitat in the African stream. His \nroutine job gave him the money and the free time he needed \nfor his hobby. \nHawthorne is a famous example of what can be accom­\nplished while working in a humdrum job. He spent years at \nthe Customs House in Salem, Massachusetts, and produced \nfour novels, including the classic The Scarlet Letter. \nHow to Repeal Parkinson's Law \nI feel that so long as people do the job they are hired and \nrequired to do, they shouldn't have to look busy every minute \nof the time. I have always tried to give the people who work \nfor me a real incentive to make good use of their time by \nallowing them to do reading, writing, crocheting, or whatever \nthey want, after they finish my work. I have even sent them \nhome early when there was nothing else to be done. \nThe policy of making people sit at their desks even if they \nhave nothing to do breeds bad time habits and accounts for a \ncertain amount of psychological aggravation. It isn't surpris­\ning that work expands to fill the time allowed for its com­\npletion, as C. Northcote Parkinson has stated, since all too \noften there are no alternatives available. I propose that it's \ntime to repeal Parkinson's Law by allowing people to reap \nthe benefits of getting done early and letting them do their \npersonal things. \nIn \"limitless\" jobs where there are truly an endless number \nof things that could be done—such as creating advertising \ncopy, researching, selling encyclopedias, removing every \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 61 \nspeck of dust from the house—Parkinson's Law theoretically \ndoesn't apply; there is always enough work. In practice, cer­\ntain tasks tend to be done on a particular day and are then \nstretched out. You really can't push people to be creative by \nthe clock, and beyond a certain point simply putting in the \nhours is not necessarily the best way to get creative work \ndone, as the architect I mentioned earlier learned. \nParkinson's Law is real, and work does expand to fill the \ntime available, because you need to fill up time when you \ncan't go home early. Try to convince your boss to let you go \nhome if you've finished all your work by telling him what a \ngreat incentive it will give you to complete your work \nquickly. If you're unsuccessful, try to convince him to allow \nyou to satisfy your personal priorities of reading books, writ­\ning your own letters, and the like while you handle the \nswitchboard, the service counter, or the reception desk. \nMaking the Most Out of One \nSpare Minute \nYou can squeeze in a start toward your lifetime",

As your dreams show, your subconscious works while \nyou sleep. Why not deliberately put it to work on your tough \nproblems? Here's how: \nPose a question to your subconscious just before you fall \nasleep. Select one that requires hours of thought—after all, \nyour subconscious will have four to eight hours to work on it \nNow, don't waste time thinking about it consciously, but do \nexpect a meaningful answer when you awaken. Many who \nhave tried this method have found it successful. But if it only \nkeeps you awake, by all means forget it. \nWhat do you do if you have to put eight hours a day into \na job you don't like? Whether it's for a summer or a year, \nlet's say you have decided to stay at least temporarily in a \njob that is not satisfying. If you're simply working to bring in \nmoney, is there any way that you can do more than just \nmark time? \n60 ALAN LAKEIN \nI had a fascinating talk recently with a young man who is \na devoted fish breeder. He began breeding mollies at the age \nof ten and has worked his way up to breeding killifish. Proba­\nbly because of his strong hobby interest—he spends three \nhours every evening on his fish-breeding project—he has \nfound a very routine civil-service job. While he is filling out \nforms for the state, he also plans what he's going to do next \nabout his fish. For example, he recently decided to breed a \nrare species of killifish which had to be imported from Af­\nrica. These fish were being imported under the Endangered \nSpecies Act, and he did much thinking about how to breed \nthem successfully in his second-floor apartment, quite differ­\nent from their natural habitat in the African stream. His \nroutine job gave him the money and the free time he needed \nfor his hobby. \nHawthorne is a famous example of what can be accom­\nplished while working in a humdrum job. He spent years at \nthe Customs House in Salem, Massachusetts, and produced \nfour novels, including the classic The Scarlet Letter. \nHow",

As your dreams show, your subconscious works while \nyou sleep. Why not deliberately put it to work on your tough \nproblems? Here's how: \nPose a question to your subconscious just before you fall \nasleep. Select one that requires hours of thought—after all, \nyour subconscious will have four to eight hours to work on it \nNow, don't waste time thinking about it consciously, but do \nexpect a meaningful answer when you awaken. Many who \nhave tried this method have found it successful. But if it only \nkeeps you awake, by all means forget it. \nWhat do you do if you have to put eight hours a day into \na job you don't like? Whether it's for a summer or a year, \nlet's say you have decided to stay at least temporarily in a \njob that is not satisfying. If you're simply working to bring in \nmoney, is there any way that you can do more than just \nmark time? \n60 AL",

If you're simply working to bring in \nmoney, is there any way that you can do more than just \nmark time? \n60 ALAN LAKEIN \nI had a fascinating talk recently with a young man who is \na devoted fish breeder. He began breeding mollies at the age \nof ten and has worked his way up to breeding killifish. Proba­\nbly because of his strong hobby interest—he spends three \nhours every evening on his fish-breeding project—he has \nfound a very routine civil-service job. While he is filling out \nforms for the state, he also plans what he's going to do next \nabout his fish. For example, he recently decided to breed a \nrare species of killifish which had to be imported from Af­\nrica. These fish were being imported under the Endangered \nSpecies Act, and he did much thinking about how to breed \nthem successfully in his second-floor apartment, quite differ­\nent from their natural habitat in the African stream. His \nroutine job gave him the money and the free time he needed \nfor his hobby. \nHawthorne",

    "text": " is a famous example of what can be accom­\nplished while working in a humdrum job. He spent years at \nthe Customs House in Salem, Massachusetts, and produced \nfour novels, including the classic The Scarlet Letter. \nHow to Repeal Parkinson's Law \nI feel that so long as people do the job they are hired and \nrequired to do, they shouldn't have to look busy every minute \nof the time. I have always tried to give the people who work \nfor me a real incentive to make good use of their time by \nallowing them to do reading, writing, crocheting, or whatever \nthey want, after they finish my work. I have even sent them \nhome early when there was nothing else to be done. \nThe policy of making people sit at their desks even if they \nhave nothing to do breeds bad time habits and accounts for a \ncertain amount of psychological aggravation. It isn't surpris­\ning that work expands to fill the time allowed for its com­\npletion, as C. Northcote Parkinson has stated, since all too \noften there are no alternatives available. I propose that it's \ntime to repeal Parkinson's Law by allowing people to reap \nthe benefits of getting done early and letting them do their \npersonal things. \nIn \"limitless\" jobs where there are truly an endless number \nof things that could be done—such as creating advertising \ncopy, researching, selling encyclopedias, removing every \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 61 \nspeck of dust from the house—Parkinson's Law theoretically \ndoesn't apply; there is always enough work. In practice, cer­\ntain tasks tend to be done on a particular day and are then \nstretched out. You really can't push people to be creative by \nthe clock, and beyond a certain point simply putting in the \nhours is not necessarily the best way to get creative work \ndone, as the architect I mentioned earlier learned. \nParkinson's Law is real, and work does expand to fill the \ntime available, because you need to fill up time when you \ncan't go home early. Try to convince your boss to let you go \nhome if you've finished all your work by telling him what a \ngreat incentive it will give you to complete your work \nquickly. If you're unsuccessful, try to convince him to allow \nyou to satisfy your personal priorities of reading books",

I propose that it's \ntime to repeal Parkinson's Law by allowing people to reap \nthe benefits of getting done early and letting them do their \npersonal things. \nIn \"limitless\" jobs where there are truly an endless number \nof things that could be done—such as creating advertising \ncopy, researching, selling encyclopedias, removing every \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 61 \nspeck of dust from the house—Parkinson's Law theoretically \ndoesn't apply; there is always enough work. In practice, cer­\ntain tasks tend to be done on a particular day and are then \nstretched out. You really can't push people to be creative by \nthe clock, and beyond a certain point simply putting in the \nhours is not necessarily the best way to get creative work \ndone, as the architect I mentioned earlier learned. \nParkinson's Law is real, and work does expand to fill the \ntime available, because you need to fill up time when you \ncan't go home early. Try to convince your boss to let you go",

A very helpful way to do this is to develop what I call \n\"special-emphasis goals\" lasting from a week to a couple of \nmonths. Each day do something to squeeze in at least one \nA-activity for each special-emphasis goal. \nLet's say your lifetime goals include intellectual develop­\nment You decide to improve your vocabulary as a means to \nimproving your intellect. A special-emphasis goal might be to \nlearn a new word from the dictionary every day for a month. \nIt takes only a minute to find a good word, check on its \nmeaning, and think of a couple sentences you can use the \nword in. Then squeeze that word into your conversation \nseveral times during the day. \nA budding gourmet cook had a special-emphasis goal of \ntrying a new vegetable dish each day for a week; she laid out \nthe whole week in advance and each day pulled out a new \nrecipe and was quickly on her way. \nA married couple, feeling a bit lonely, laid out a program \nof renewing acquaintances and meeting new acquaintances \nevery weekend for a month. Their special emphasis goals \n62 ALAN LAKE IN \napplied to Saturdays and Sundays only. In a month they had \neight very pleasant social evenings or afternoons, going out to \ndinner, playing records together, and talking politics. \nIsometric exercises can be squeezed in while you are mak­\ning dinner or sitting, or even while waiting for another per­\nson to answer the telephone. Here again, if you keep in mind \nyour added special-emphasis goal of fitting in some exercise, \nyou will find many opportunities during the day to realize it \nWork goals can be developed as special-emphasis goals. A \nsalesman can go after one big-ticket customer each day. A \nfactory superintendent can personally check the quality of \none finished automobile by driving it home directly off the \nproduction line. A freelance journalist can clip at least three \nstory ideas every day for those times when he can't think of \na thing to do. An office manager can take a couple of extra \nminutes to become more friendly and learn about a different \nemployee each day. All these activities can be squeezed in \nwhen you have a special-emphasis program suggesting now is \nthe time to make an extra effort toward realizing a particular \ngoal. \nNot only are these A-activities on a special-emphasis goal \na practical step toward getting where you want to go; they \nalso become tremendous morale boosters. Daily you see \nyourself coming closer to your lifetime goals by remembering \nwhat you want to do—and doing it \nYou don't want your special-emphasis goals to be out of \nmind because they're out of sight. Write the goal on a letter \ncard and slip it into your pocket as a reminder. Or how \nabout putting up a sign? I suggested to one client that he put \na littie sign on his desk where only he could see it. It said, \n\"Am I talking on the telephone too long?\" He had admitted \nto me that he generally did talk too long. Putting this remind­\ner by his phone each day for a week helped to reduce his \noverlong telephone calls. \nA homemaker trying to do the least amount of dusting and \nhomemaking possible this week put a sign in her kitchen \nsaying, \"Get out of the kitchen and have a good time.\" \nNo time? You've got to be kidding! \n9. MAKING THE MOST \nOF PRIORITIES \nTHE MAIN SECRET of getting more done every day took me \nseveral months of research to discover. When I first started \ndelving into better time use, I asked successful people what \nthe secret of their success was. I recall an early discussion \nwith a vice-president of Standard Oil Company of California \nwho said, \"Oh, I just keep a 'to-do' list.\" I passed over that \nquickly, little suspecting at the time the importance of what \nhe said. \nI happened to travel the next day to a large city to give a \ntime-management seminar. While I was there I had lunch \nwith a businessman who practically owned the town. He was \nchairman of the gas and light company, president of five \nmanufacturing companies, and had his hand in a dozen other \nenterprises. By all standards he was a business success. I \nasked him the same question of how he managed to get \nmore done and he said, \"Oh, that's easy",

A very helpful way to do this is to develop what I call \n\"special-emphasis goals\" lasting from a week to a couple of \nmonths. Each day do something to squeeze in at least one \nA-activity for each special-emphasis goal. \nLet's say your lifetime goals include intellectual develop­\nment You decide to improve your vocabulary as a means to \nimproving your intellect. A special-emphasis goal might be to \nlearn a new word from the dictionary every day for a month. \nIt takes only a minute to find a good word, check on its \nmeaning, and think of a couple sentences you can use the \nword in. Then squeeze that word into your conversation \nseveral times during the day. \nA budding gourmet cook had a special-emphasis goal of \ntrying a new vegetable dish each day for a week; she laid out \nthe whole week in advance and each day pulled out a new \nrecipe and was quickly on her way. \nA married couple, feeling a bit lonely, laid out a program \nof renewing acquaintances and meeting new acquaintances \nevery weekend for a month. Their special emphasis goals \n62 ALAN LAKE IN \napplied to Saturdays and Sundays only. In a month they had \neight very pleasant social evenings or afternoons, going out to \ndinner, playing records together, and talking politics. \nIsometric exercises can be squeezed in while you are mak­\ning dinner or sitting, or even while waiting for another per­\nson to answer the telephone. Here again, if you keep in mind \nyour added special-emphasis goal of fitting in some exercise, \nyou will find many opportunities during the day to realize it \nWork goals can be developed as special-emphasis goals. A \nsalesman can go after one big-ticket customer each day. A \nfactory superintendent can personally check the quality of \none finished automobile by driving it home directly off the \nproduction line. A freelance journalist can clip at least three \nstory ideas every day for those times when he can't think of \na thing to do. An office",

A very helpful way to do this is to develop what I call \n\"special-emphasis goals\" lasting from a week to a couple of \nmonths. Each day do something to squeeze in at least one \nA-activity for each special-emphasis goal. \nLet's say your lifetime goals include intellectual develop­\nment You decide to improve your vocabulary as a means to \nimproving your intellect. A special-emphasis goal might be to \nlearn a new word from the dictionary every day for a month. \nIt takes only a minute to find a good word, check on its \nmeaning, and think of a couple sentences you can use the \nword in. Then squeeze that word into your conversation \nseveral times during the day. \nA budding gourmet cook had a special-emphasis goal of \ntrying a new vegetable dish each day for a week;",

A freelance journalist can clip at least three \nstory ideas every day for those times when he can't think of \na thing to do. An office manager can take a couple of extra \nminutes to become more friendly and learn about a different \nemployee each day. All these activities can be squeezed in \nwhen you have a special-emphasis program suggesting now is \nthe time to make an extra effort toward realizing a particular \ngoal. \nNot only are these A-activities on a special-emphasis goal \na practical step toward getting where you want to go; they \nalso become tremendous morale boosters. Daily you see \nyourself coming closer to your lifetime goals by remembering \nwhat you want to do—and doing it \nYou don't want your special-emphasis goals to be out of \nmind because they're out of sight. Write the goal on a letter \ncard and slip it into your pocket as a reminder. Or how \nabout putting up a sign? I suggested to one client that he put \na littie sign on his desk where only he could see it. It said, \n\"Am I talking on the telephone too long?\" He had admitted \nto me that he generally did talk too long. Putting this remind­\ner by his phone each day for a week helped to reduce his \noverlong telephone calls. \nA homemaker trying to do the least amount of dusting and \nhomemaking possible this week put a sign in her kitchen \nsaying, \"Get out of the kitchen and have a good time.\" \nNo time? You've got to be kidding! \n9. MAKING THE MOST \nOF PRIORITIES \nTHE MAIN SECRET of getting more done every day took me \nseveral months of research to discover. When I first started \ndelving into better time use, I asked successful people what \nthe secret of their success was. I recall an early discussion \nwith a vice-president of Standard Oil Company of California \nwho said, \"Oh, I just keep a 'to-do' list.\" I passed over that \nquickly, little suspecting at the time the importance of what \nhe said. \nI happened to travel the next day to a large city to give a \ntime-management seminar. While I was there I had lunch \nwith a businessman who practically owned the town. He was \nchairman of the gas and light company, president of five \nmanufacturing",

I \nasked him the same question of how he managed to get \nmore done and he said, \"Oh, that's easy—I keep a To Do \nList.\" But this was a list with a difference. He told me he \nconsidered it a game. \nThe first thing in the morning, he would come in and lay \nout his list of what he wanted to accomplish that day. In the \nevening he would check to see how many of the items he had \nwritten down in the morning still remained undone and then \ngive himself a score. His goal was to have a \"no miss\" day in \nwhich every single item was crossed off. \nHe played the To Do List game much as you cover the \nsquares on a bingo card, getting items on his list done during \nthe day as opportunities presented themselves—talking to \nsomeone on the phone, bringing up points at a meeting, ex­\nploring a creative project in the evening with his wife. He \nmade sure to get started on the top-priority items right away. \nToward the end of the day he initiated whatever calls, ac­\ntions, or letters were necessary to finish up his \"bingo card\" \nfor a perfect score. \n63 \n64 ALAN LAKE IN \nAgain and again when I talked to successful businessmen \nand government administrators, the To Do List came up. So \nduring one of my seminars I asked how many people had \nheard of keeping a priority list of things to do. Virtually ev­\neryone had. Then I asked how many people conscientiously \nmade up a list of things to do every day, arranged the items \nin priority order, and crossed off each task as it was com­\npleted. I discovered that very few people keep a list of things \nto do every day, although most people occasionally make a \nTo Do List when they are particularly busy, have a lot of \nthings they want to remember to do, or have some particu­\nlarly tight deadline. \nOnly a Daily List Will Do \nPeople at the top and people at the bottom both know \nabout To Do Lists, but one difference between them is that \nthe people at the top use a To Do List every single day to \nmake better use of their time; people at the bottom know \nabout this tool but don't use it effectively. One of the real \nsecrets of getting more done is to make a To Do List every \nday, keep it visible, and use it as a guide to action as you go \nthrough the day. \nBecause the To Do List is such a fundamental time-plan­\nning tool, let's take a closer look at it The basics of the list \nitself are simple: head a piece of paper 'To Do,\" then list \nthose items on which you want to work; cross off items as \nthey are completed and add others as they occur to you; \nrewrite the list at the end of the day or when it becomes \nhard to read. \nOne of the secrets to success is to write all your 'To Do\" \nitems on a master list or lists to be kept together, rather than \njotting down items on miscellaneous scraps of paper. You \nmay want to keep your list in your appointment book. One \nexecutive keeps a special pad on his desk reserved for his \nTo Do List. I know one woman who never buys a dress with­\nout a pocket in it so she can keep her To Do List always \nwith her. \nAnother homemaker was forever losing the lists she made. \nShe spent more time looking for yesterday's list than she \nspent making today's. To help her get control of her time, \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 65 \nI had her put all her lists in a notebook. She had the added \nbenefit of being able to cull undone A's from previous lists. \nSome people try to keep To Do Lists in their heads but in \nmy experience this is rarely as effective. Why clutter your \nmind with things that can be written down? It's much better \nto leave your mind free for creative pursuits. \nWhat Belongs on the List \nAre you going to write down everything you have to do, \nIncluding routine activities? Are you only going to write \ndown exceptional events? Are you going to put down every­\nthing you might do today or only whatever you decided you \nwill do today? There are many alternatives, and different \npeople have different solutions. I recommend that you not list \nroutine items but do list everything that has high priority to­\nday and might not get done without special attention. \nDon't forget to put the A-activities for your long-term \ngoals on your To Do List. Although it may appear strange to \nsee",

I \nasked him the same question of how he managed to get \nmore done and he said, \"Oh, that's easy—I keep a To Do \nList.\" But this was a list with a difference. He told me he \nconsidered it a game. \nThe first thing in the morning, he would come in and lay \nout his list of what he wanted to accomplish that day. In the \nevening he would check to see how many of the items he had \nwritten down in the morning still remained undone and then \ngive himself a score. His goal was to have a \"no miss\" day in \nwhich every single item was crossed off. \nHe played the To Do List game much as you cover the \nsquares on a bingo card, getting items on his list done during \nthe day as opportunities presented themselves—talking to \nsomeone on the phone, bringing up points at a meeting, ex­\nploring a creative project in the evening with his wife. He \nmade sure to get started on the top-priority items right away. \nToward the end of the day he initiated whatever calls, ac­\ntions, or letters were necessary to finish up his \"bingo card\" \nfor a perfect score. \n63 \n64 ALAN LAKE IN \nAgain and again when I talked to successful businessmen \nand government administrators, the To Do List came up. So \nduring one of my seminars I asked how many people had \nheard of keeping a priority list of things to do. Virtually ev­\neryone had. Then I asked how many people conscientiously \nmade up a list of things to do every day, arranged the items \nin priority order, and crossed off each task as it was com­\npleted. I discovered that very few people keep a list of things \nto do every day, although most people occasionally make a \nTo Do List when they are particularly busy, have a lot of \nthings they want to remember to do, or have some particu­\nlarly tight deadline. \nOnly a Daily List Will Do \nPeople at the top and people at the bottom both know \nabout To Do Lists, but one difference between them is that \nthe people at the top use a To Do List every single day to \nmake better use of their time; people at the bottom know \nabout this tool but don't",

So \nduring one of my seminars I asked how many people had \nheard of keeping a priority list of things to do. Virtually ev­\neryone had. Then I asked how many people conscientiously \nmade up a list of things to do every day, arranged the items \nin priority order, and crossed off each task as it was com­\npleted. I discovered that very few people keep a list of things \nto do every day, although most people occasionally make a \nTo Do List when they are particularly busy, have a lot of \nthings they want to remember to do, or have some particu­\nlarly tight deadline. \nOnly a Daily List Will Do \nPeople at the top and people at the bottom",

One of the real \nsecrets of getting more done is to make a To Do List every \nday, keep it visible, and use it as a guide to action as you go \nthrough the day. \nBecause the To Do List is such a fundamental time-plan­\nning tool, let's take a closer look at it The basics of the list \nitself are simple: head a piece of paper 'To Do,\" then list \nthose items on which you want to work; cross off items as \nthey are completed and add others as they occur to you; \nrewrite the list at the end of the day or when it becomes \nhard to read. \nOne of the secrets to success is to write all your 'To Do\" \nitems on a master list or lists to be kept together, rather than \njotting down items on miscellaneous scraps of paper. You \nmay want to keep your list in your appointment book. One \nexecutive keeps a special pad on his desk reserved for his \nTo Do List. I know one woman who never buys a dress with­\nout a pocket in it so she can keep her To Do List always \nwith her. \nAnother homemaker was forever losing the lists she made. \nShe spent more time looking for yesterday's list than she \nspent making today's. To help her get control of her time, \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 65 \nI had her put all her lists in a notebook. She had the added \nbenefit of being able to cull undone A's from previous lists. \nSome people try to keep To Do Lists in their heads but in \nmy experience this is rarely as effective. Why clutter your \nmind with things that can be written down? It's much better \nto leave your mind free for creative pursuits. \nWhat Belongs on the List \nAre you going to write down everything you have to do, \nIncluding routine activities? Are you only going to write \ndown exceptional events? Are you going to put down every­\nthing you might do today or only whatever you decided you \nwill do today? There are many alternatives, and different \npeople have different solutions. I recommend that you not list \nroutine items but",

One of the real \nsecrets of getting more done is to make a To Do List every \nday, keep it visible, and use it as a guide to action as you go \nthrough the day. \nBecause the To Do List is such a fundamental time-plan­\nning tool, let's take a closer look at it The basics of the list \nitself are simple: head a piece of paper 'To Do,\" then list \nthose items on which you want to work; cross off items as \nthey are completed and add others as they occur to you; \nrewrite the list at the end of the day or when it becomes \nhard to read. \nOne of the secrets to success is to write all your 'To Do\" \nitems on a master list or lists to be kept together, rather than \njotting down items on miscellaneous scraps of paper. You \nmay want to keep your list in your appointment book. One \nexecutive keeps a special pad on his desk",

    "text": " do list everything that has high priority to­\nday and might not get done without special attention. \nDon't forget to put the A-activities for your long-term \ngoals on your To Do List. Although it may appear strange to \nsee \"begin learning French\" or \"find new friends\" in the same \nlist with \"bring home a quart of milk\" or \"buy birthday \ncard,\" you want to do them in the same day. If you use your \nTo Do List as a guide when deciding what to work on next, \nthen you need the long-term projects represented, too, so \nyou won't forget them at decision time and consequently not \ndo them. \nBefore you even consider doing anything yourself, look \nover the list and see how many tasks you can delegate. Not \njust to your subordinates or the babysitter, but to those at \nyour level and even higher, who do a job more quickly and \neasily, or who could suggest short-cuts you'd overlook. \nDepending on your responsibilities, you might, if you try \nhard enough, get all the items on your To Do List completed \nby the end of each day. If so, by all means try. But probably \nyou can predict in advance that there is no way to do them \nall. When there are too many things to do, conscious choice \nas to what (and what not) to do is better than letting the de­\ncision be determined by chance. \nI cannot emphasize strongly enough: You must set priori­\nties. Some people do as many items as possible on their lists. \nThey get a very high percentage of tasks done, but their ef-\n66 ALAN LAKE IN \nfectiveness fs low because the tasks they've done are mostly \nof C-priority. Others like to start at the top of the list and go \nright down it, again with little regard to what's important. \nThe best way is to take your list and label each item ac­\ncording to ABC priority, delegate as much as \"\"you can, and \nthen polish off the list accordingly. \nOne person I know color-codes the entries, using black \nfor normal entries and red for top-priority items. For peo­\nple who have trouble living with priorities, I have found \nthat it's helpful to use one piece of paper for the A's and \nB's and another page for the more numerous C's. The A and \nB paper is kept on top of the C list, and every time you \nraise the A and B list to do a C, you're aware that you're \nnot making the best use of your time. \nItems on the To Do List may be arranged in several \nforms. One form is functional: to see, to telephone, to follow \nup, to think about, to decide, to dictate. Or you can group \nactivities based on the similarity of the work content (every­\nthing about water pollution), the same location (several cus­\ntomers in one neighborhood), or the same person (several \ntopics needing the boss's opinion). You can have a single \nitem on your To Do List represent a group (processing the \npapers in your in-box, doing errands). \nDon't Worry about Completing Your List \nNow go down your list, doing all the A's before the B's \nand the B's before the C's. Some days you may get all the \nitems on your list done, but more likely there will not be time \nto do them all. If you are doing them in ABC order you may \nnot even finish all the A's sometimes. On other days you will \ndo the A's and B's and on other days A's, B's, and some C's. \nOne rarely reaches the bottom of a To Do List. It's not com­\npleting the list that counts, but making the best use of your \ntime. If you find yourself with only B's and C's left, take a \nfresh look at possible activities and add to your list items \nsuch as revising your filing system for greater accessibility, \nfinishing War and Peace, picking out a birthday present for \nyour aunt—all A's that were in the back of your mind but \ndidn't make it to the original list. With a little extra time, to­\nday they can be started. \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 67 \nMany office workers, homemakers, and professional people \nhave come to my seminars because they felt the need to \"get \norganized.\" Most report a couple of months later that they \nfeel much more organized simply because they regularly list \nand set priorities. For example, a newly appointed head nurse \nused the listing/setting priorities approach for her home life \nafter she had found how well it worked at the hospital. Good \ntime use is as important off the",

Although it may appear strange to \nsee \"begin learning French\" or \"find new friends\" in the same \nlist with \"bring home a quart of milk\" or \"buy birthday \ncard,\" you want to do them in the same day. If you use your \nTo Do List as a guide when deciding what to work on next, \nthen you need the long-term projects represented, too, so \nyou won't forget them at decision time and consequently not \ndo them. \nBefore you even consider doing anything yourself, look \nover the list and see how many tasks you can delegate. Not \njust to your subordinates or the babysitter, but to those at \nyour level and even higher, who do a job more quickly and \neasily, or who could suggest short-cuts you'd overlook. \nDepending on your responsibilities, you might, if you try \nhard enough, get all the items on your To Do List completed \nby the end of each day. If so, by all means try. But probably \nyou can predict in advance that there is no way to do them \nall. When there are too many things to do, conscious choice \nas to what (and what not) to do is better than letting the de­\ncision be determined by chance. \nI cannot emphasize strongly enough: You must set priori­\nties. Some people do as many items as possible on their lists. \nThey get a very high percentage of tasks done, but their ef-\n66 ALAN LAKE IN \nfectiveness fs low because the tasks they've done are mostly \nof C-priority. Others like to start at the top of the list and go \nright down it, again with little regard to what's important. \nThe best way is to take your list and label each item ac­\ncording to ABC priority, delegate as much as \"\"you can, and \nthen polish off the list accordingly. \nOne person I know color-codes the entries, using black \nfor normal entries and red for top-priority items. For peo­\nple who have trouble living with priorities, I have found \nthat it's helpful to use one piece of paper for the A's and \nB's and another page for the more numerous C's. The A and \n",

Although it may appear strange to \nsee \"begin learning French\" or \"find new friends\" in the same \nlist with \"bring home a quart of milk\" or \"buy birthday \ncard,\" you want to do them in the same day. If you use your \nTo Do List as a guide when deciding what to work on next, \nthen you need the long-term projects represented, too, so \nyou won't forget them at decision time and consequently not \ndo them. \nBefore you even consider doing anything yourself, look \nover the list and see how many tasks you can delegate. Not \njust to your subordinates or the babysitter, but to those at \nyour level and even higher, who do a job more quickly and \neasily, or who could suggest short-cuts you'd overlook. \nDepending on your responsibilities, you might, if you try \nhard enough, get all the items on your To Do List completed \nby the end of each day. If so, by all means try. But probably \nyou can predict",

When there are too many things to do, conscious choice \nas to what (and what not) to do is better than letting the de­\ncision be determined by chance. \nI cannot emphasize strongly enough: You must set priori­\nties. Some people do as many items as possible on their lists. \nThey get a very high percentage of tasks done, but their ef-\n66 ALAN LAKE IN \nfectiveness fs low because the tasks they've done are mostly \nof C-priority.

    "text": ". For peo­\nple who have trouble living with priorities, I have found \nthat it's helpful to use one piece of paper for the A's and \nB's and another page for the more numerous C's. The A and \nB paper is kept on top of the C list, and every time you \nraise the A and B list to do a C, you're aware that you're \nnot making the best use of your time. \nItems on the To Do List may be arranged in several \nforms. One form is functional: to see, to telephone, to follow \nup, to think about, to decide, to dictate. Or you can group \nactivities based on the similarity of the work content (every­\nthing about water pollution), the same location (several cus­\ntomers in one neighborhood), or the same person (several \ntopics needing the boss's opinion). You can have a single \nitem on your To Do List represent a group (processing the \npapers in your in-box, doing errands). \nDon't Worry about Completing Your List \nNow go down your list, doing all the A's before the B's \nand the B's before the C's. Some days you may get all the \nitems on your list done, but more likely there will not be time \nto do them all. If you are doing them in ABC order you may \nnot even finish all the A's sometimes. On other days you will \ndo the A's and B's and on other days A's, B's, and some C's. \nOne rarely reaches the bottom of a To Do List. It's not com­\npleting the list that counts, but making the best use of your \ntime. If you find yourself with only B's and C's left, take a \nfresh look at possible activities and add to your list items \nsuch as revising your filing system for greater accessibility, \nfinishing War and Peace, picking out a birthday present for \nyour aunt—all A's that were in the back of your mind but \ndidn't make it to the original list. With a little extra time, to­\nday they can be started. \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 67 \nMany office workers, homemakers, and professional people \nhave come to my seminars because they felt the need to \"get \norganized.\" Most report a couple of months later that they \nfeel much more organized simply because",

The A and \nB paper is kept on top of the C list, and every time you \nraise the A and B list to do a C, you're aware that you're \nnot making the best use of your time. \nItems on the To Do List may be arranged in several \nforms. One form is functional: to see, to telephone, to follow \nup, to think about, to decide, to dictate. Or you can group \nactivities based on the similarity of the work content (every­\nthing about water pollution), the same location (several cus­\ntomers in one neighborhood), or the same person (several \ntopics needing the boss's opinion). You can have a single \nitem on your To Do List represent a group (processing the \npapers in your in-box, doing errands). \nDon't Worry about Completing Your List \nNow go down your list, doing all the A's before the B's \nand the B's before the C's.

    "text": " they regularly list \nand set priorities. For example, a newly appointed head nurse \nused the listing/setting priorities approach for her home life \nafter she had found how well it worked at the hospital. Good \ntime use is as important off the job as on it. You don't want \nto turn your off-work time into a work-like situation, but you \ncan relax even more if those things you have to do are orga­\nnized with the aid of a To Do List, then gotten out of the \nway quickly. \nThe chief accountant I mentioned in the previous chapter \nspent his time making sure that of all the possible things he \ncould do, he was really doing the most important. He took \ntime to set priorities and went home feeling on top of his job \nbecause he had done the most important activities on his list \nIf little things mean a lot a list of things to do in priority \norder means a great deal because it provides you with the \nsecurity of knowing that nothing is missing; an affirmation \nof all your important activities; a motivation to cross off \nitems you don't need to do; and a reservoir from which you \ncan select activities to be done next \nBy doing more A's and fewer C's, the hierarchy of your \naccomplishments will change. You can break up your old A's \ninto new A's and B's, downgrading your old B's to C's and \ndropping most of the old C's off your list entirely. \nHow to Do More Things That Matter \nFor instance, a year ago attending Parents' Day at your \ndaughter's school would have been rated A. But now you're \ninvolved in a part-time fashion-design business, and your \ndaughter understands how busy you are and how much satis­\nfaction you derive from your business, so you won't go to \nParents' Day unless it's a slow time in your business. Last \nyear you attended to every detail of the annual inventory \nyourself. Happily, while you were doing it, you recorded the \nnecessary steps so that this year, with that reference guide in \nhand, last year's A (figuring out what to do) becomes this \nyear's C: following a routine. Now you are able to delegate \n68 ALAN LAKE IN \nthe annual inventory to the new stock boy and use your time \nto merchandise your products better. \nThe salesman who continually upgrades his customers finds \nthat last year's A—the $100-unit customer—is this year's C. \nNow his A-customer is a $500-unit account; his B is a $250-\nunit account. He upgraded his business this way by conscien­\ntiously going after the A-accounts. He spent more and more \nof his time with those who bought over $100, so gradually he \nwas able to consider anyone below $100 to be a C. To en­\ncourage this continual upgrading, he went through his cus­\ntomer files each week and threw away at least one low dollar \nprospect or customer. In my experience, most salesmen could \nbenefit substantially by arbitrarily weeding out 20 percent of \ntheir customers in terms of present and potential volume. \nLearning a musical instrument is much the same. When \nyou first play the piano your A is to practice easy pieces. \nOnce you become proficient, it would be a C to continue \nplaying them. So you practice more and more difficult pieces. \nWhen you are learning a difficult piece, the A is to play it \nslowly but accurately and the C to play it fast with what \nwould likely be many mistakes. As you become more profi­\ncient in playing a passage, the A becomes playing the passage \nat its correct tempo. \nIn learning and applying time use skills, it may be an A to \nwatch how to spend every five minutes for an hour so that \nyou become much more aware of time use. Once you be­\ncome automatically aware of time use, it is a C even to think \nabout time passing unless you want to sharpen up that skill \nagain. \nThe good time user has a constant stream of A's going \nthrough the pipeline and is not hung up on which A to do or \nhow to do it or trying to be a perfectionist about a particu­\nlar A. Rather, he does a number of A-tasks daily and re­\nmembers that as soon as he has identified the best use of his \ntime, the time to do it is now. \n10. TASKS BETTER LEFT UNDONE \nHOW OFTEN HAVE YOU resorted to poking through routine \nwork (to get a feeling of satisfaction because you're doing \nthe processing efficiently) while you let more important ac­\ntivities go because you want to avoid the feeling of doing \nthem inefficiently? \nResorting to desk-neatening and turning out gobs of trivia",

For example, a newly appointed head nurse \nused the listing/setting priorities approach for her home life \nafter she had found how well it worked at the hospital. Good \ntime use is as important off the job as on it. You don't want \nto turn your off-work time into a work-like situation, but you \ncan relax even more if those things you have to do are orga­\nnized with the aid of a To Do List, then gotten out of the \nway quickly. \nThe chief accountant I mentioned in the previous chapter \nspent his time making sure that of all the possible things he \ncould do, he was really doing the most important. He took \ntime to set priorities and went home feeling on top of his job \nbecause he had done the most important activities on his list \nIf little things mean a lot a list of things to do in priority \norder means a great deal because it provides you with the \nsecurity of knowing that nothing is missing; an affirmation \nof all your important activities; a motivation to cross off \nitems you don't need to do; and a reservoir from which you \ncan select activities to be done next \nBy doing more A's and fewer C's, the hierarchy of your \naccomplishments will change. You can break up your old A's \ninto new A's and B's, downgrading your old B's to C's and \ndropping most of the old C's off your list entirely. \nHow to Do More Things That Matter \nFor instance, a year ago attending Parents' Day at your \ndaughter's school would have been rated A. But now you're \ninvolved in a part-time fashion-design business, and your \ndaughter understands how busy you are and how much satis­\nfaction you derive from your business, so you won't go to \nParents' Day unless it's a slow time in your business. Last \nyear you attended to every detail of the annual inventory \nyourself. Happily, while you were doing it, you recorded the \nnecessary steps so that this year, with that reference guide in \nhand, last year's A (figuring out what to do) becomes this \nyear's C: following a routine. Now you are able to delegate \n68 ALAN LAKE IN \nthe annual inventory to the new stock boy and use your time \nto merchandise your products better. \nThe salesman who continually upgrades his customers finds \nthat last year",

For example, a newly appointed head nurse \nused the listing/setting priorities approach for her home life \nafter she had found how well it worked at the hospital. Good \ntime use is as important off the job as on it. You don't want \nto turn your off-work time into a work-like situation, but you \ncan relax even more if those things you have to do are orga­\nnized with the aid of a To Do List, then gotten out of the \nway quickly. \nThe chief accountant I mentioned in the previous chapter \nspent his time making sure that of all the possible things he \ncould do, he was really doing the most important. He took \ntime to set priorities and went home feeling on top of his job \nbecause he had done the most important activities on his list \nIf little things mean a lot a list of things to do in priority \norder means a great deal because it provides you with the \nsecurity of knowing that nothing is missing; an affirmation \nof all your important activities; a motivation to cross off \nitems you don't need to do; and a reservoir from which you \ncan select activities to be done next \nBy doing more A's and fewer C",

You can break up your old A's \ninto new A's and B's, downgrading your old B's to C's and \ndropping most of the old C's off your list entirely. \nHow to Do More Things That Matter \nFor instance, a year ago attending Parents' Day at your \ndaughter's school would have been rated A. But now you're \ninvolved in a part-time fashion-design business, and your \ndaughter understands how busy you are and how much satis­\nfaction you derive from your business, so you won't go to \nParents' Day unless it's a slow time in your business. Last \nyear you attended to every detail of the annual inventory \nyourself. Happily, while you were doing it, you recorded the \nnecessary steps so that this year, with that reference guide in \nhand, last year's A (figuring out what to do) becomes this \nyear's C:",

Now you are able to delegate \n68 ALAN LAKE IN \nthe annual inventory to the new stock boy and use your time \nto merchandise your products better. \nThe salesman who continually upgrades his customers finds \nthat last year's A—the $100-unit customer—is this year's C. \nNow his A-customer is a $500-unit account; his B is a $250-\nunit account. He upgraded his business this way by conscien­\ntiously going after the A-accounts. He spent more and more \nof his time with those who bought over $100, so gradually he \nwas able to consider anyone below $100 to be a C. To en­\ncourage this continual upgrading, he went through his cus­\ntomer files each week and threw away at least one low dollar \nprospect or customer. In my experience, most salesmen could \nbenefit substantially by arbitrarily weeding out 20 percent of \ntheir customers in terms of present and potential volume. \nLearning a musical instrument is much the same. When \nyou first play the piano your A is to practice easy pieces. \nOnce you become proficient, it would be a C to continue \nplaying them. So you practice more and more difficult pieces. \nWhen you are learning a difficult piece, the A is to play it \nslowly but accurately and the C to play it fast with what \nwould likely be many mistakes. As you become more profi­\ncient in playing a passage, the A becomes playing the passage \nat its correct tempo. \nIn learning and applying time use skills, it may be an A to \nwatch how to spend every five minutes for an hour so that \nyou become much more aware of time use. Once you be­\ncome automatically aware of time use, it is a C even to think \nabout time passing unless you want to sharpen up that skill \nagain. \nThe good time user has a constant stream of A's going \nthrough the pipeline and is not hung up on which A to do or \nhow to do it or trying to be a perfectionist about a particu­\nlar A. Rather, he does a number of A-tasks daily and re­\nmembers that as soon as he has identified the best use of his \ntime, the time to do it is now. \n10.

Now you are able to delegate \n68 ALAN LAKE IN \nthe annual inventory to the new stock boy and use your time \nto merchandise your products better. \nThe salesman who continually upgrades his customers finds \nthat last year's A—the $100-unit customer—is this year's C. \nNow his A-customer is a $500-unit account; his B is a $250-\nunit account. He upgraded his business this way by conscien­\ntiously going after the A-accounts. He spent more and more \nof his time with those who bought over $100, so gradually he \nwas able to consider anyone below $100 to be a C. To en­\ncourage this continual upgrading, he went through his cus­\ntomer files each week and threw away at least one low dollar \nprospect or customer. In my experience, most salesmen could \nbenefit substantially by arbitrarily weeding out 20 percent of \ntheir customers in terms of present and potential volume. \nLearning a musical instrument is much the same. When \nyou first play the piano your A is to practice easy pieces. \nOnce you become proficient, it would be a C to continue \nplaying them. So you practice more and more",

You would be unlikely to \nlabel this as an A-activity unless it's become a disaster area. \nBut because it's such an easy thing to do and the results show \nimmediately, you might very well spend an extra few minutes \nunnecessarily neatening your desk when perhaps the thing to \ndo is get away from your desk and go out and see what you \ncan do about the personnel problem that needs solving down \nin department 73. \nThe harried field representative whose plane leaves in \nforty-five minutes gives one more instruction to the office \nhelp before going on a two-week trip. He is giving in to the \nurge to do a C which might very well mean messing up the \nmost important A he can do, namely, catching the flight. \nWhy do people have this strong tendency to get bogged \ndown with C's? One reason is that many activities of top \nvalue cannot, by their very nature, be performed well. Part \nof the value may be that they have never been done before. \nExamples include: setting up a committee to consider manu­\nfacturing a new, highly competitive product; diapering a baby \nfor the first time; learning Chinese; switching to organic \ncooking; finding something else to do with your evenings be­\nsides watching television. \nThe homemaker who collects another delicious-sounding \nrecipe when she has five hundred untried clippings is giving in \nto the short-term feeling of a great find but is truly wasting \n69 \n70 ALAN LAKE IN \nher time because she never gets around to using the recipes \nshe has been collecting. She wastes her time clipping instead \nof providing her husband and children with the substantial \nmeals that she really wants them to have. She may kid her­\nself into thinking that she is making herself a better cook, but \nthe truth is that she is clipping rather than cooking. \nYou should not expect to do A-activities perfectly the first \ntime. The problems associated with them are new, untried, \nunknown, and uncertain. Doing them means taking risks, \nwhich, whether calculated or not, will sometimes bring on \nunsuccessful outcome. An A-l may appear to be of over­\nwhelming complexity, or too time-consuming; or require \nreconciling views of people who can't or won't agree. \nWith all these things going against executing a hard A-l, \nis there any wonder you look around for something you can \ndo well? One of the things you can do well is clear up all the \neasy C's And you justify it by saying you are clearing them \naway so that you will then be free to do the A-l later. \nYou have very cleverly set up a situation where you won't \nleave the, house until you empty the garbage, won't do the \nA-l until all the B's and C's are out of the way. It becomes \nmore important to do the B's and C's than to do the A-l, be­\ncause you won't do the A-l until ycju get the others done. \nYou are making sure you do the B's and C's by hooking \nthem onto the A-l. \nThere is a certain luxurious feeling that comes from doing \nwhatever you want without regard to priority or time in­\nvolved. Since you know you're not doing A's, you can waste \ntime and gain the feeling of doing something well, starting \nsomething easy and finishing it, crossing an item off your list, \nand moving the paper from your in-box to your out-box. But \ndon't kid yourself: it's because you're doing all those C's and \nnot because you haven't any time, that you don't get to do \nyour A's. \nThe 80/20 Rule \nWhen I deal with people who claim they are overwhelmed, \none of the best ways I can help them is to have them become \nmore comfortable with not doing C's. But people are often \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 71 \nvery hesitant to let go of C's; therefore, I would like to sug­\ngest to you the following: the 80/20 rule. \nThe 80/20 rule says, \"If all items are arranged in order of \nvalue, 80 percent of the value would come from only 20 per­\ncent of the items, while the remaining 20 percent of the \nvalue would come from 80 percent of the items.\" Sometimes \nit's a",

You would be unlikely to \nlabel this as an A-activity unless it's become a disaster area. \nBut because it's such an easy thing to do and the results show \nimmediately, you might very well spend an extra few minutes \nunnecessarily neatening your desk when perhaps the thing to \ndo is get away from your desk and go out and see what you \ncan do about the personnel problem that needs solving down \nin department 73. \nThe harried field representative whose plane leaves in \nforty-five minutes gives one more instruction to the office \nhelp before going on a two-week trip. He is giving in to the \nurge to do a C which might very well mean messing up the \nmost important A he can do, namely, catching the flight. \nWhy do people have this strong tendency to get bogged \ndown with C's? One reason is that many activities of top \nvalue cannot, by their very nature, be performed well. Part \nof the value may be that they have never been done before. \nExamples include: setting up a committee to consider manu­\nfacturing a new, highly competitive product; diapering a baby \nfor the first time; learning Chinese; switching to organic \ncooking; finding something else to do with your evenings be­\nsides watching television. \nThe homemaker who collects another delicious-sounding \nrecipe when she has five hundred untried clippings is giving in \nto the short-term feeling of a great find but is truly wasting \n69 \n70 ALAN LAKE IN \nher time because she never gets around to using the recipes \nshe has been collecting. She wastes her time clipping instead \nof providing her husband and children with the substantial \nmeals that she really wants them to have. She may kid her­\nself into thinking that she is making herself a better cook, but \nthe truth is that she is clipping rather than cooking. \nYou should not expect to do A-activities perfectly the first \ntime. The problems associated with them are new, untried, \nunknown, and uncertain. Doing them means taking",

You would be unlikely to \nlabel this as an A-activity unless it's become a disaster area. \nBut because it's such an easy thing to do and the results show \nimmediately, you might very well spend an extra few minutes \nunnecessarily neatening your desk when perhaps the thing to \ndo is get away from your desk and go out and see what you \ncan do about the personnel problem that needs solving down \nin department 73. \nThe harried field representative whose plane leaves in \nforty-five minutes gives one more instruction to the office \nhelp before going on a two-week trip. He is giving in to the \nurge to do a C which might very well mean messing up the \nmost important A he can do, namely, catching the flight. \nWhy do people have this strong tendency to get bogged \ndown with C's?

The problems associated with them are new, untried, \nunknown, and uncertain. Doing them means taking risks, \nwhich, whether calculated or not, will sometimes bring on \nunsuccessful outcome. An A-l may appear to be of over­\nwhelming complexity, or too time-consuming; or require \nreconciling views of people who can't or won't agree. \nWith all these things going against executing a hard A-l, \nis there any wonder you look around for something you can \ndo well? One of the things you can do well is clear up all the \neasy C's And you justify it by saying you are clearing them \naway so that you will then be free to do the A-l later. \nYou have very cleverly set up a situation where you won't \nleave the, house until you empty the garbage, won't do the \nA-l until all the B's and C's are out of the way. It becomes \nmore important to do the B's and C's than to do the A-l, be­\ncause you won't do the A-l until ycju get the others done. \nYou are making sure you do the B's and C's by hooking \nthem onto the A-l. \nThere is a certain luxurious feeling that comes from doing \nwhatever you want without regard to priority or time in­\nvolved. Since you know you're not doing A's, you can waste \ntime and gain the feeling of doing something well, starting \nsomething easy and finishing it, crossing an item off your list, \nand moving the paper from your in-box to your out-box. But \ndon't kid yourself: it's because you're doing all those C's and \nnot because you haven't any time, that you don't get to do \nyour A's. \nThe 80/20 Rule \nWhen I deal with people who claim they are overwhelmed, \none of the best ways I can help them is to have them become \nmore comfortable with not doing C's. But people are often \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 71 \nvery hesitant to let go of C's; therefore, I would like to sug­\ngest to you the following: the 80/20 rule. \nThe 80/20 rule says, \"If all items are arranged in",

An A-l may appear to be of over­\nwhelming complexity, or too time-consuming; or require \nreconciling views of people who can't or won't agree. \nWith all these things going against executing a hard A-l, \nis there any wonder you look around for something you can \ndo well? One of the things you can do well is clear up all the \neasy C's And you justify it by saying you are clearing them \naway so that you will then be free to do the A-l later. \nYou have very cleverly set up a situation where you won't \nleave the, house until you empty the garbage, won't do the \nA-l until all the B's and C's are out of the way. It becomes \nmore important to do the B's and C's than to do the A-l, be­\ncause you won't do the A-l until yc",

It becomes \nmore important to do the B's and C's than to do the A-l, be­\ncause you won't do the A-l until ycju get the others done. \nYou are making sure you do the B's and C's by hooking \nthem onto the A-l. \nThere is a certain luxurious feeling that comes from doing \nwhatever you want without regard to priority or time in­\nvolved. Since you know you're not doing A's, you can waste \ntime and gain the feeling of doing something well, starting \nsomething easy and finishing it, crossing an item off your list, \nand moving the paper from your in-box to your out-box. But \ndon't kid yourself: it's because you're doing all those C's and \nnot because you haven't any time, that you don't get to do \nyour A's. \nThe 80/20 Rule \nWhen I deal with people who claim they are overwhelmed, \none of the best ways I can help them is to have them become \nmore comfortable with not doing C's.

Find \nthese two, label them A, get them done. Leave most of the \nother eight undone, because the value you'll get from them \nwill be significantly less than that of the two highest-value \nitems. \nThese examples, drawn from everyday life, should enable \nyou to feel more comfortable about concentrating on high-\nvalue tasks, even at the cost of ignoring many lower-value \ntasks: \n80 percent of sales come from 20 percent of customers \n80 percent of production is in 20 percent of the product line \n80 percent of sick leave is taken by 20 percent of employees \n80 percent of file usage is in 20 percent of files \n80 percent of dinners repeat 20 percent of recipes \n80 percent of dirt is on 20 percent of floor areas that is \nhighly used \n80 percent of dollars is spent on 20 percent of the expensive \nmeat and grocery items \n80 percent of the washing is done on the 20 percent of the \nwardrobe that is well-used items \n80 percent of TV time is spent on 20 percent of programs \nmost popular with the family \n80 percent of reading time is spent on 20 percent of the \npages in the newspaper (front page, sport page, editorials, \ncolumnists, feature page) \n80 percent of telephone calls come from 20 percent of all \ncallers \n80 percent of eating out is done at 20 percent of favorite \nrestaurants \nIt's important to remind yourself again and again not to \nget bogged down on low-value activities but to focus on the \n20 percent where the high value is. \n72 ALAN LAKEIN \nA local political candidate came to me for advice two \nmonths before the election. He was the underdog against an \nincumbent who had been in office for many years. He recog­\nnized that he would have to make maximum use of his time \nto win. But he had accepted many invitations to talk to unim­\nportant groups, and found his schedule hopelessly clogged. \nLittle of his time remained to go after groups with large \nmemberships for crucial luncheon meetings and evening lec­\ntures. \nHe knew he had failed to exercise selectivity in accepting \nspeaking engagements. While he felt that he could not cancel \nany engagements already accepted, he decided he would be \nmuch more conscientious about setting priorities in accepting \nfuture engagements. It took him some time to come around \nto this view, because he felt a great need to bring his message \nto all the voters. We ran down his list of speaking engage­\nments and discovered that, unquestionably, 80 percent of his \nexposure was coming from 20 percent or less of his speeches. \nThe 80 percent of his time that was going to low-exposure \nspeeches contributed little to his cause. In fact, they wore \nhim out so that he was ill at ease and exhausted for those \nspeeches that really counted. He recalled that Nixon spent \nthe last days of the 1960 campaign rushing to Alaska, \nHawaii, Wyoming, etc., to fulfill his pledge to visit all fifty \nstates while Kennedy concentrated on the larger states that \nwould given him an electoral majority. \nBy the end of our talk the candidate realized he could get \nout of several unimportant speeches—they had not been def­\ninite commitments—and substitute more significant appear­\nances. The real payoff for his selectivity came when he won \nthe election handsomely. \nA wealthy woman socialite accepted too many demands of \nothers. She could always be counted on to do anything from \nlicking envelopes to twisting the arms of congressmen. She \nfelt she wasn't getting as much pleasure out of all these activ­\nities as she might, because she was letting other people set \nher priorities. She needed to recognize that 80 percent of her \nvoluntary activities were unsatisfying busywork, and that the \nreal joy came from a few activities which she felt strongly \nabout. \nWhat we did was sit down and create a massive list of \nover one hundred activities she had participated in (or agreed \nto participate in) during the past three months. She then \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 73 \nlooked at them objectively and developed a profile of her \nA's: helping political candidates, talking with interesting \npeople,",

Find \nthese two, label them A, get them done.

Find \nthese two, label them A, get them done. Leave most of the \nother eight undone, because the value you'll get from them \nwill be significantly less than that of the two highest-value \nitems. \nThese examples, drawn from everyday life, should enable \nyou to feel more comfortable about concentrating on high-\nvalue tasks, even at the cost of ignoring many lower-value \ntasks: \n80 percent of sales come from 20 percent of customers \n80 percent of production is in 20 percent of the product line \n80 percent of sick leave is taken by 20 percent of employees \n80 percent of file usage is in 20 percent of files \n80 percent of dinners repeat 20 percent",

    "text": "months before the election. He was the underdog against an \nincumbent who had been in office for many years. He recog­\nnized that he would have to make maximum use of his time \nto win. But he had accepted many invitations to talk to unim­\nportant groups, and found his schedule hopelessly clogged. \nLittle of his time remained to go after groups with large \nmemberships for crucial luncheon meetings and evening lec­\ntures. \nHe knew he had failed to exercise selectivity in accepting \nspeaking engagements. While he felt that he could not cancel \nany engagements already accepted, he decided he would be \nmuch more conscientious about setting priorities in accepting \nfuture engagements. It took him some time to come around \nto this view, because he felt a great need to bring his message \nto all the voters. We ran down his list of speaking engage­\nments and discovered that, unquestionably, 80 percent of his \nexposure was coming from 20 percent or less of his speeches. \nThe 80 percent of his time that was going to low-exposure \nspeeches contributed little to his cause. In fact, they wore \nhim out so that he was ill at ease and exhausted for those \nspeeches that really counted. He recalled that Nixon spent \nthe last days of the 1960 campaign rushing to Alaska, \nHawaii, Wyoming, etc., to fulfill his pledge to visit all fifty \nstates while Kennedy concentrated on the larger states that \nwould given him an electoral majority. \nBy the end of our talk the candidate realized he could get \nout of several unimportant speeches—they had not been def­\ninite commitments—and substitute more significant appear­\nances. The real payoff for his selectivity came when he won \nthe election handsomely. \nA wealthy woman socialite accepted too many demands of \nothers. She could always be counted on to do anything from \nlicking envelopes to twisting the arms of congressmen. She \nfelt she wasn't getting as much pleasure out of all these activ­\nities as she might, because she was letting other people set \nher priorities.

She then \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 73 \nlooked at them objectively and developed a profile of her \nA's: helping political candidates, talking with interesting \npeople, working in the field of conservation, and collecting \nart. Her B's included charity benefits, work above the clerical \nlevel for the parents' group at her children's school. Every­\nthing else was a C, including supervising the church cake \nsale, doing hospital volunteer work, and participating in the \nwomen's group of the local symphony. \nWhat she did was to take her courage in hand over the \nnext several months and say \"no\" to all organizations, people, \nand activities on the C-list. This gave her much more time to \nbecome really involved at the art museum. She even began to \ndo a little research on Oriental vases. She also initiated a \nvery well received reorganization of her neighborhood politi­\ncal club. \nWhen Not to Do Cs \nOne of the best ways to find time for your A's is by reduc­\ning the number of C's that you feel compelled to spend time \non. \nThe main question with Cs is \"What can I not do?\" Think \nof the great feeling of satisfaction of drawing a line through \na C-item on your To Do List—without even having to go \nthrough the effort of doing it! Rather than think, \"I have to \ndo this C,\" get into the habit of thinking, \"Maybe I don't \nhave to do this CP \nLet's say your To Do List contains \"Get the car washed.\" \nYou have given this a C-priority, but are tempted to take a \nhalf hour out and get it washed anyway, just to get it off \nyour mind and off the list. It is much easier to get it off your \nlist and forget about it by deciding it doesn't need to be done \nat all. \nMany C's can be turned into what I call \"CZ's.\" CZ's are \nC's that can be deferred indefinitely without harm. \nDefinite CZ's include rearranging a pile of magazines, in­\nventorying the freezer (when you just did it last month and \nnothing has changed significantly in the interim), mopping \nthe kitchen floor just before the children come home on a \nrainy day, checking the morning mail when your secretary al­\nways brings it in immediately upon arrival. You can probably \n74 ALAN LAKE IN \nthink of many other items that are too trivial to do, or will \nsettle themselves by the passage of time, or are best forgotten \nunless there is a demand from an outside source. \nSome C's need to be deliberately deferred to test whether \nthey become CZ's. They go through an \"aging\" period to see \nwhether or not they die a natural death. Such possible CZ's \ninclude: watering the lawn when it looks like rain, shoveling \nthe snow when it looks like sun, bundling the newspapers to­\nday for recycling when the Boy Scouts probably will be col­\nlecting in the neighborhood next week, preparing a meeting \ntopic that probably won't come up. \nWhen I am unsure of whether something can be ignored \ncompletely, I make a little note of the item on a 3x5-inch \nindex card and stick the card in a file folder labeled \"Pos­\nsible CZ's,\" feeling secure that it will come up again some \nday if its important. Once a month I look through the file \nfolder, and am able to throw most of the cards in the trash, \ncongratulating myself on all the things I didn't have to do. \nMany C's can be turned into CZ's without any great trou­\nble and with little loss in value. Other C's, of course, must be \ndone. Even though they are trivial, routine tasks, there is the \npossibility of great loss by failing to do them. You can make \nsuch C's palatable by thinking of the larger context into \nwhich they fit. A government employee who spends most of a \nday answering a trivial letter from a congressman makes sure \nit is done accurately and promptly, because when you work \nfor the government it's wise not to arouse a congressman's \nire. Similarly, the salesman who spends the better part of a \nmorning tracking down a delayed shipment of a $2.17 part \nfor his best customer can keep in mind that 40 percent of his \nentire earnings last year came from this one customer. \nWhen a C Becomes a Crisis \nSome things—such as refilling the gas tank in your auto­\nmobile—that are C's and capable of being deferred, can de­\nvelop into crises if put off too long. There is no great advan­\ntage in",

Her B's included charity benefits, work above the clerical \nlevel for the parents' group at her children's school. Every­\nthing else was a C, including supervising the church cake \nsale, doing hospital volunteer work, and participating in the \nwomen's group of the local symphony. \nWhat she did was to take her courage in hand over the \nnext several months and say \"no\" to all organizations, people, \nand activities on the C-list.

You can probably \n74 ALAN LAKE IN \nthink of many other items that are too trivial to do, or will \nsettle themselves by the passage of time, or are best forgotten \nunless there is a demand from an outside source. \nSome C's need to be deliberately deferred to test whether \nthey become CZ's. They go through an \"aging\" period to see \nwhether or not they die a natural death. Such possible CZ's \ninclude: watering the lawn when it looks like rain, shoveling \nthe snow when it looks like sun, bundling the newspapers to­\nday for recycling when the Boy Scouts probably will be col­\nlecting in the neighborhood next week, preparing a meeting \ntopic that probably won't come up. \nWhen I am unsure of whether something can be ignored \ncompletely, I make a little note of the item on a 3x5-inch \nindex card and stick the card in a file folder labeled \"Pos­\nsible CZ's,\" feeling secure that it will come up again some \nday if its important. Once a month I look through the file \nfolder, and am able to throw most of the cards in the trash, \ncongratulating myself on all the things I didn't have to do. \nMany C's can be turned into CZ's without any great trou­\nble and with little loss in value. Other C's, of course, must be \ndone. Even though they are trivial, routine tasks, there is the \npossibility of great loss by failing to do them. You can make \nsuch C's palatable by thinking of the larger context into \nwhich they fit. A government employee who spends most of a \nday answering a trivial letter from a congressman makes sure \nit is done accurately and promptly, because when you work \nfor the government it's wise not to arouse a congressman's \nire. Similarly, the salesman who spends the better part of a \nmorning tracking down a delayed shipment of a $2.17 part \nfor his best customer can keep in mind that 40 percent of his \nentire earnings last year came from this one customer. \nWhen a C Becomes a Crisis \n",

    "text": "Some things—such as refilling the gas tank in your auto­\nmobile—that are C's and capable of being deferred, can de­\nvelop into crises if put off too long. There is no great advan­\ntage in filling the gas tank when it is three-quarters full, but \nyou do save time if you fill it when it is nearly empty, since \nthis reduces the number of times you have to make a trip to \nthe gas station. Needless to say, waiting a little bit too long \ncan be very costly as well as time-consuming if you happen \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 75 \nto get stuck on a deserted road with an empty gas tank and \nno gas station within twenty-two miles. \nA word of caution. Putting off buying insurance or making \na will, even though you are in perfect health and can't imag­\nine any problems, is certainly not advisable. Nor is putting off \nsuch a relatively trivial chore as washing laundry. While \ndressing for a big Saturday evening party, you might find you \nhave no clean underwear. \nRemember: Tasks rarely go from the bottom of the C-pile \nto crisis proportions without some warning. They gradually \nwork their way up the scale. Let's say you've been asked to \nsubmit a routine production report. You have a hunch that \nthis is a C that will die a natural death without your having \nto do anything about it. Several days later, a follow-up re­\nquest comes into your in-box. You take the item from the \nbottom of the paper-work pile and place it on the top. Then \na phone call comes in inquiring about the report. You now \ndecide it's a B. When the boss says, \"Give me this tomorrow \nor you're through,\" it becomes an immediate A and gets \ndone. You can watch the priority of these items change. If \nyou're smart, you will realize that fewer than one in a hun­\ndred C's ever becomes a crisis. The best approach is not to do \nall the C's just in case, but rather to watch for the follow-up \nrequests to tip you off to a potential crisis, then nip the prob­\nlem in the bud. \nIf you can let the dusting, washing, filing, or checking \ngo one more day, then let it. You will have spent less of \nyour life dusting, filing, and washing. If you continually re­\nsist the temptation to do the C's, you can significantly in­\ncrease the number that become CZ's. Always keep in mind \nthe question \"How terrible would it be if I didn't do this \nC?\" If your answer is \"Not too terrible,\" then don't do it. \nYou Need a C-Drawer \nGive the ABCs their place. Rather than let the high-qual­\nity A's get buried by the much larger quantity of C's, try re­\nserving a special place on the top of your desk for the A \nitems. Create a special \"C-drawer\" where the unimportant \nitems can get dumped safely out of the way. If you already \nhave a C-drawer, get yourself a bigger one, or a whole cabi­\nnet for C's to be kept out of the way. As a start, try physi-\n76 ALAN LAKEIN \ncally separating your paper work into small A-piles and \nB-piles and a much larger C-pile. Re-sort the B-pile into \neither the A or C group, and then put the A's in the \"A-\nplace\" and the C's in the \"C-drawer.\" \nIf you haven't cleared your desk for a few months, take \neverything off the desk and out of all the drawers, and put it \non a table. Going through it, you will probably find there will \nbe some A's, some B's, some C's, but there will also be a lot \nof useless material that you can toss into the trash can. You'll \nknow the operation is a success if you have to borrow other \npeople's trash cans to get rid of your junk. \nIf, like so many homemakers, you don't have a desk, then \nyou probably have the same problem as Ms. Jones. She had \none paperwork drawer where she dumped current mail, notes \nto herself, items clipped from magazines, her children's \nschool schedules, notices of meetings and appointments, let­\nters to be answered, coupons, announcements of department \nstore sales, bills and check stubs, magazine-subscription no­\ntices, notes on the History of China course she took at night \nschool two years before, string, ribbon and a fancy bow, and \nbirthday cards. \nWhen the time came to answer a letter, she had no alter­\nnative",

There is no great advan­\ntage in filling the gas tank when it is three-quarters full, but \nyou do save time if you fill it when it is nearly empty, since \nthis reduces the number of times you have to make a trip to \nthe gas station. Needless to say, waiting a little bit too long \ncan be very costly as well as time-consuming if you happen \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 75 \nto get stuck on a deserted road with an empty gas tank and \nno gas station within twenty-two miles. \nA word of caution. Putting off buying insurance or making \na will, even though you are in perfect health and can't imag­\nine any problems, is certainly not advisable. Nor is putting off \nsuch a relatively trivial chore as washing laundry. While \ndressing for a big Saturday evening party, you might find you \nhave no clean underwear. \nRemember: Tasks rarely go from the bottom of the C-pile \nto crisis proportions without some warning. They gradually \nwork their way up the scale. Let's say you've been asked to \nsubmit a routine production report. You have a hunch that \nthis is a C that will die a natural death without your having \nto do anything about it. Several days later, a follow-up re­\nquest comes into your in-box. You take the item from the \nbottom of the paper-work pile and place it on the top. Then \na phone call comes in inquiring about the report. You now \ndecide it's a B. When the boss says, \"Give me this tomorrow \nor you're through,\" it becomes an immediate A and gets \ndone. You can watch the priority of these items change. If \nyou're smart, you will realize that fewer than one in a hun­\ndred C's ever becomes a crisis. The best approach is not to do \nall the C's just in case, but rather to watch for the follow-up \nrequests to tip you off to a potential crisis, then nip the prob­\nlem in the bud. \nIf you can let the dusting, washing, filing, or checking \ngo one more day, then let it.

While \ndressing for a big Saturday evening party, you might find you \nhave no clean underwear. \nRemember: Tasks rarely go from the bottom of the C-pile \nto crisis proportions without some warning. They gradually \nwork their way up the scale. Let's say you've been asked to \nsubmit a routine production report. You have a hunch that \nthis is a C that will die a natural death without your having \nto do anything about it. Several days later, a follow-up re­\nquest comes into your in-box. You take the item from the \nbottom of the paper-work pile and place it on the top. Then \na phone call comes in inquiring about the report. You now \ndecide it's a B. When the boss says, \"Give me this tomorrow \nor you're through,\" it becomes an immediate A and gets \ndone. You can watch the priority of these items change. If \nyou're smart, you will realize that fewer than one in a hun­\ndred C's ever becomes a crisis. The best approach is not to do \nall the C's just in case, but rather to watch for the follow-up \nrequests to tip you off to a potential crisis, then",

You will have spent less of \nyour life dusting, filing, and washing. If you continually re­\nsist the temptation to do the C's, you can significantly in­\ncrease the number that become CZ's. Always keep in mind \nthe question \"How terrible would it be if I didn't do this \nC?\" If your answer is \"Not too terrible,\" then don't do it. \nYou Need a C-Drawer \nGive the ABCs their place. Rather than let the high-qual­\nity A's get buried by the much larger quantity of C's, try re­\nserving a special place on the top of your desk for the A \nitems. Create a special \"C-drawer\" where the unimportant \nitems can get dumped safely out of the way. If you already \nhave a C-drawer, get yourself a bigger one, or a whole cabi­\nnet for C's to be kept out of the way.

Re-sort the B-pile into \neither the A or C group, and then put the A's in the \"A-\nplace\" and the C's in the \"C-drawer.\" \nIf you haven't cleared your desk for a few months, take \neverything off the desk and out of all the drawers, and put it \non a table. Going through it, you will probably find there will \nbe some A's, some B's, some C's, but there will also be a lot \nof useless material that you can toss into the trash can. You'll \nknow the operation is a success if you have to borrow other \npeople's trash cans to get rid of your junk. \nIf, like so many homemakers, you don't have a desk, then \nyou probably have the same problem as Ms. Jones.

    "text": "tices, notes on the History of China course she took at night \nschool two years before, string, ribbon and a fancy bow, and \nbirthday cards. \nWhen the time came to answer a letter, she had no alter­\nnative but to pull out the entire stack of stuff and search until \nshe found the letter she wanted. Similarly, at the beginning of \neach month she had to search through her whole pile to pull \nout the bills she needed to pay. She sought every opportunity \nto avoid going into her paperwork drawer. She even delayed \nanswering important mail because she dreaded the search. \nThe solution to her problem seems obvious—and it was, \nalthough not to her, because she felt so swamped. I suggested \na file box, which she bought, and one hundred tabbed Manila \nfile folders. She made folders for recipes, bills, letters to be \nanswered, letters to save, make-up ideas, stitchery projects, \ncoming events, children's activities, trips to take, books to \nread, and the like. Once she finally got her accumulation filed \naway, it was easy for her to take each new piece of paper \nand put it in the proper folder. Then, when she felt like writ­\ning letters she didn't have to use all the time finding the let­\nters that needed answering. She could go directly to the \"let­\nters\" folder and begin at once. \nNo doubt many housewives have some type of filing sys-\nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LD7E 77 \ntem. The important thing is to keep the A's separated from \nthe C's. If you have a lot of letters and correspondence, you \nmight want to have separate folders for A-letters, B- and C-\nletters. \nEvery Housewife Deserves a Desk \nEven better than a cardboard filing box, if you can man­\nage it, is a desk. The homemaker has a great deal of paper­\nwork, and she's entitled to a comfortable place to do it I \nhave seen interior decoration suggestions for putting a little \ndesk instead of an end table along side of a sofa with a lamp \non it in the living room, or converting an unused corner of \nthe kitchen into a paperwork place, using the kitchen drawers \nfor paper storage. I heartily applaud such efforts to find the \nhomemaker a paperwork place to call her own. \nThe owner of a large clothing store came to me feeling \noverwhelmed by the quantity of paperwork that came his \nway every day. He was bombarded with information about \nnew clothing lines, order and inventory forms from the many \nmanufacturers he bought from, advertising and promotion \nideas from his advertising agency, local papers and radio sta­\ntions, and tax and payroll forms. He felt it necessary to open \nall the mail and examine it himself. In addition, he wrote \nmany memos with ideas for improving the store and its mer­\nchandise and salespeople's skills. \nHe was continually reshuffling these papers, since he \ncouldn't quite decide what to do with many of them. Also, \nthere were so many good ideas that he hated to give any of \nthem up. He knew he wasn't making ABC distinctions, and \nthe pile of papers on his desk was overwhelming him. \nI enabled him to solve his problem by suggesting that each \nday, when the mail came in, he arrange it in priority order \nwith the most important on top, then start at the top of the \npile and work down. I had him put all of the B and C paper­\nwork he didn't get to that day in his right-hand drawer. The \nnext day he began with the new mail and, if there was time, \nreached into the drawer and did some of yesterday's paper­\nwork. Often he would go home sorry that he hadn't gotten to \na particular item, and so the next morning he would reach \ninto his drawer and pull out that piece of paper and put it \nwith his \"today's\" pile. Sometimes he would get a follow-up \n78 ALAN LAKE IN \nrequest for additional material on something he hadn't gotten \nto previously, so again he would reach into the drawer, pull it \nout, and combine it with the current mail. \nNot surprisingly, 80 percent of the paper he put in that \ndrawer never got worked on. He did, however, take 20 per­\ncent of it out of the drawer and process it with the day's \nwork. \nWhen the drawer was full, I suggested he take all of the \npaper and move it to the bottom right-hand drawer. This \nworked fine for another three weeks, until the top drawer \nfilled up again. He then went through the bottom drawer and \nthrew away what he didn't need. And he repeated the process \nabout every two weeks",

Similarly, at the beginning of \neach month she had to search through her whole pile to pull \nout the bills she needed to pay. She sought every opportunity \nto avoid going into her paperwork drawer. She even delayed \nanswering important mail because she dreaded the search. \nThe solution to her problem seems obvious—and it was, \nalthough not to her, because she felt so swamped. I suggested \na file box, which she bought, and one hundred tabbed Manila \nfile folders. She made folders for recipes, bills, letters to be \nanswered, letters to save, make-up ideas, stitchery projects, \ncoming events, children's activities, trips to take, books to \nread, and the like. Once she finally got her accumulation filed \naway, it was easy for her to take each new piece of paper \nand put it in the proper folder. Then, when she felt like writ­\ning letters she didn't have to use all the time finding the let­\nters that needed answering. She could go directly to the \"let­\nters\" folder and begin at once. \nNo doubt many housewives have some type of filing sys-\nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LD7E 77 \ntem. The important thing is to keep the A's separated from \nthe C's. If you have a lot of letters and correspondence, you \nmight want to have separate folders for A-letters, B- and C-\nletters. \nEvery Housewife Deserves a Desk \nEven better than a cardboard filing box, if you can man­\nage it, is a desk. The homemaker has a great deal of paper­\nwork, and she's entitled to a comfortable place to do it I \nhave seen interior decoration suggestions for putting a little \ndesk instead of an end table along side of a sofa with a lamp \non it in the living room, or converting an unused corner of \nthe kitchen into a paperwork place, using the kitchen drawers \nfor paper storage. I heartily applaud such efforts to find the \nhomemaker a paperwork place to call her own. \nThe owner of a large clothing",

She made folders for recipes, bills, letters to be \nanswered, letters to save, make-up ideas, stitchery projects, \ncoming events, children's activities, trips to take, books to \nread, and the like.

    "text": " or converting an unused corner of \nthe kitchen into a paperwork place, using the kitchen drawers \nfor paper storage. I heartily applaud such efforts to find the \nhomemaker a paperwork place to call her own. \nThe owner of a large clothing store came to me feeling \noverwhelmed by the quantity of paperwork that came his \nway every day. He was bombarded with information about \nnew clothing lines, order and inventory forms from the many \nmanufacturers he bought from, advertising and promotion \nideas from his advertising agency, local papers and radio sta­\ntions, and tax and payroll forms. He felt it necessary to open \nall the mail and examine it himself. In addition, he wrote \nmany memos with ideas for improving the store and its mer­\nchandise and salespeople's skills. \nHe was continually reshuffling these papers, since he \ncouldn't quite decide what to do with many of them. Also, \nthere were so many good ideas that he hated to give any of \nthem up. He knew he wasn't making ABC distinctions, and \nthe pile of papers on his desk was overwhelming him. \nI enabled him to solve his problem by suggesting that each \nday, when the mail came in, he arrange it in priority order \nwith the most important on top, then start at the top of the \npile and work down. I had him put all of the B and C paper­\nwork he didn't get to that day in his right-hand drawer. The \nnext day he began with the new mail and, if there was time, \nreached into the drawer and did some of yesterday's paper­\nwork. Often he would go home sorry that he hadn't gotten to \na particular item, and so the next morning he would reach \ninto his drawer and pull out that piece of paper and put it \nwith his \"today's\" pile. Sometimes he would get a follow-up \n78 ALAN LAKE IN \nrequest for additional material on something he hadn't gotten \nto previously, so again he would reach into the drawer, pull it \nout, and combine it with the current mail. \nNot surprisingly, 80 percent of the paper he put in that \ndrawer never got worked on. He did, however, take 20 per­\ncent of it out of the drawer and process it with the day's \nwork. \nWhen the drawer was full, I suggested he take all of the \npaper and move it to the bottom",

    "text": " or converting an unused corner of \nthe kitchen into a paperwork place, using the kitchen drawers \nfor paper storage. I heartily applaud such efforts to find the \nhomemaker a paperwork place to call her own. \nThe owner of a large clothing store came to me feeling \noverwhelmed by the quantity of paperwork that came his \nway every day. He was bombarded with information about \nnew clothing lines, order and inventory forms from the many \nmanufacturers he bought from, advertising and promotion \nideas from his advertising agency, local papers and radio sta­\ntions, and tax and payroll forms. He felt it necessary to open \nall the mail and examine it himself. In addition, he wrote \nmany memos with ideas for improving the store and its mer­\nchandise and salespeople's skills. \nHe was continually reshuffling these papers, since he \ncouldn't quite decide what to do with many of them.

He knew he wasn't making ABC distinctions, and \nthe pile of papers on his desk was overwhelming him. \nI enabled him to solve his problem by suggesting that each \nday, when the mail came in, he arrange it in priority order \nwith the most important on top, then start at the top of the \npile and work down. I had him put all of the B and C paper­\nwork he didn't get to that day in his right-hand drawer. The \nnext day he began with the new mail and, if there was time, \nreached into the drawer and did some of yesterday's paper­\nwork. Often he would go home sorry that he hadn't gotten to \na particular item, and so the next morning he would reach \ninto his drawer and pull out that piece of paper and put it \nwith his \"today's\" pile. Sometimes he would get a follow-up \n78 ALAN LAKE IN \nrequest for additional material on something he hadn't gotten \nto previously, so again he would reach into the drawer, pull it \nout, and combine it with the current mail. \nNot surprisingly, 80 percent of the paper he put in that \ndrawer never got worked on.",

And he repeated the process \nabout every two weeks",

    "text": " right-hand drawer. This \nworked fine for another three weeks, until the top drawer \nfilled up again. He then went through the bottom drawer and \nthrew away what he didn't need. And he repeated the process \nabout every two weeks, or as he needed to. \nNext: The Wastebasket \nAll along, of course, whenever he saw an opportunity, he \nthrew paper into his wastebasket. Probably most of the pa­\npers that he had just taken out of the bottom right-hand \ndrawer could have gone into the basket and never been \nmissed, but he was reluctant to throw away something, so I \nsuggested he take his stuff and put it all in a file folder labeled \n\"C's from the bottom right-hand drawer, September 1-30.** \nWhen he had another batch of material, it was put in a file \nfolder with the date on it and placed behind the first file \nfolder in a large filing cabinet. At my suggestion, he contin­\nued to remove the contents of his bottom right-hand drawer \nto a file folder, which was then kept for a year. He found it \nmost satisfying to make room for his current folder of C-ma-\nterial by removing last year's folder and going through it \nquickly, congratulating himself on not having done so many \nthings that turned out to be unimportant. At this point, he \nfelt comfortable tossing out most of the stuff and keeping the \none or two pieces of paper that still seemed to be viable. \nThese went in priority order with that day's mail and were \nrecycled to the middle drawer if not done that day. \nAfter a year it became clear that he had kept himself from \ndoing much hard work that would have netted him very little \nbenefit. For instance, his thoughts about sprucing up the \nshelves where he displayed sweaters were obsolete, since he \nhad taken out the shelves and put in racks. His clipping about \nhow to promote costume jewelry could be thrown away, \nsince he no longer stocked jewelry. His reminder to himself \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 79 \nabout the inadequacies of the stock boy could be dispensed \nwith, because the stock boy quit a few weeks later. \nHow to Keep on Top of Paperwork \nThe truth is that you need never shuffle a piece of paper \nagain. This does not mean that you can stop handling paper. \nBut you can develop a system that will keep the paper where \nit belongs and keep you on top of it—if you need to be. The \nsystem must take into account both incoming and outgoing \npaper, and what happens to it in between. \nIncoming mail should be screened and sorted. For a few \ndays, examine all mail critically. Look for opportunities to \neliminate or reduce the volume of paper that comes in. (You \nmight find a series of obsolete reports to be discontinued.) \nYou can then tell your secretary what material to screen out \nroutinely and throw away, what to route to others or file di­\nrectly. \nOne executive has his secretary sort his daily mail into \n\"Action,\" \"Information,\" and \"Deferred\" folders. The \"Ac­\ntion\" folder requires, and gets, his immediate attention. The \n\"Information\" folder he slips into his briefcase for reading on \nthe train. He keeps the \"Deferred\" file, which includes his \nperiodicals, in a drawer for spare moments or when he needs \na break from concentrating on more substantial matters. \nYou can encourage faster decisionmaking and get work \nout sooner by writing informal notes right on a piece of in­\ncoming mail and sending it on to the out-box. If you need to \nkeep a record of the correspondence for your file, or want a \nreminder to check for follow-through, have your secretary \nmake a photocopy. \nFor correspondence that requires a more formal or lengthy \nreply, a dictating machine can be your best friend. Those \nwho learn how to dictate a finished product on the first try \nrave about the time it saves. One executive saves even more \ntime by dictating only key ideas and then letting his secretary \nconstruct a letter that accomplishes his purpose. \nOnly Once, With Feeling! \nOne of my best rules is \"Handle each piece of paper only \nonce.\" Try not to put down an incoming piece of paper that \nso ALAN LAKEIN \nrequires a response until you have fired off that response. It is \noften easier to think of the right thing to say when you've \njust received the letter and your first reaction is fresh in your \nmind. In addition, you save the setup time required to famil­\niarize yourself with it again later on. \nNot all pieces of paper lend themselves to immediate and \nfinal action. Some papers linger for weeks or months and re­\nquire many actions",

    "text": " right-hand drawer. This \nworked fine for another three weeks, until the top drawer \nfilled up again. He then went through the bottom drawer and \nthrew away what he didn't need. And he repeated the process \nabout every two weeks, or as he needed to. \nNext: The Wastebasket \nAll along, of course, whenever he saw an opportunity, he \nthrew paper into his wastebasket. Probably most of the pa­\npers that he had just taken out of the bottom right-hand \ndrawer could have gone into the basket and never been \nmissed, but he was reluctant to throw away something, so I \nsuggested he take his stuff and put it all in a file folder labeled \n\"C's from the bottom right-hand drawer, September 1-30.** \nWhen he had another batch of material, it was put in a file \nfolder with the date on it and placed behind the first file \nfolder in a large filing cabinet. At my suggestion, he contin­\nued to remove the contents of his bottom right-hand drawer \nto a file folder, which was then kept for a year. He found it \nmost satisfying to make room for his current folder of C-ma-\nterial by removing last year's folder and going through it \nquickly, congratulating himself on not having done so many \nthings that turned out to be unimportant. At this point, he \nfelt comfortable tossing out most of the stuff and keeping the \none or two pieces of paper that still seemed to be viable. \nThese went in priority order with that day's mail and were \nrecycled to the middle drawer if not done that day. \nAfter a year it became clear that he had kept himself from \ndoing much hard work that would have netted him very little \nbenefit. For instance, his thoughts about sprucing up the \nshelves where he displayed sweaters were obsolete, since he \nhad taken out the shelves and put in racks. His clipping about \nhow to promote costume jewelry could be thrown away, \nsince he no longer stocked jewelry. His reminder to himself \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 79 \nabout the inadequacies of the stock boy could be dispensed \nwith, because the stock boy quit a few weeks later. \nHow to Keep on Top of Paperwork \nThe truth is that you need never shuffle a piece of paper \nagain. This does not mean that you can stop handling paper.",

This does not mean that you can stop handling paper. \nBut you can develop a system that will keep the paper where \nit belongs and keep you on top of it—if you need to be. The \nsystem must take into account both incoming and outgoing \npaper, and what happens to it in between. \nIncoming mail should be screened and sorted. For a few \ndays, examine all mail critically. Look for opportunities to \neliminate or reduce the volume of paper that comes in. (You \nmight find a series of obsolete reports to be discontinued.) \nYou can then tell your secretary what material to screen out \nroutinely and throw away, what to route to others or file di­\nrectly. \nOne executive has his secretary sort his daily mail into \n\"Action,\" \"Information,\" and \"Deferred\" folders. The \"Ac­\ntion\" folder requires, and gets, his immediate attention. The \n\"Information\" folder he slips into his briefcase for reading on \nthe train. He keeps the \"Deferred\" file, which includes his \nperiodicals, in a drawer for spare moments or when he needs \na break from concentrating on more substantial matters. \nYou can encourage faster decisionmaking and get work \nout sooner by writing informal notes right on a piece of in­\ncoming mail and sending it on to the out-box. If you need to \nkeep a record of the correspondence for your file, or want a \nreminder to check for follow-through, have your secretary \nmake a photocopy. \nFor correspondence that requires a more formal or lengthy \nreply, a dictating machine can be your best friend. Those \nwho learn how to dictate a finished product on the first try \nrave about the time it saves. One executive saves even more \ntime by dictating only key ideas and then letting his secretary \nconstruct a letter that accomplishes his purpose. \nOnly Once, With Feeling! \nOne of my best rules is \"Handle each piece of paper only \nonce.\" Try not to put down an incoming piece of paper that \nso ALAN LAKEIN \nrequires a response until you have fired off that response. It is \noften easier to think of the right thing to say when you've \njust received the letter and your first reaction is fresh in your \nmind. In",

In addition, you save the setup time required to famil­\niarize yourself with it again later on. \nNot all pieces of paper lend themselves to immediate and \nfinal action. Some papers linger for weeks or months and re­\nquire many actions",

    "text": " addition, you save the setup time required to famil­\niarize yourself with it again later on. \nNot all pieces of paper lend themselves to immediate and \nfinal action. Some papers linger for weeks or months and re­\nquire many actions spread over time before work on them is \ncomplete. In some projects every word counts and polishing \neach word is a good investment. Sometimes you make better \ndecisions if you put them off and think about them for a \nwhile. \nTherefore, the more comprehensive rule is 'Try to handle \neach piece of paper only once. If you can't, every time you \npick up a piece of paper do something to move ahead the \nproject it represents.*' If you can't take a big step, even the \nsmallest step counts. \nFor example, one executive might pick up a piece of paper \nand think, \"This represents an unpleasant task. I can't bring \nmyself to do it now, but the next time I pick it up I'll make \na phone call and get it started.\" He has done at least some­\nthing to move this project ahead by planning his next step. \nThe next time he finds the same paper in his hands, he is not \nlikely to put it down until he has made that phone call. \nOn the other hand, don't do more than is necessary. One \nsecretary complains that her boss is such a perfectionist that \nhe never gets a letter out in fewer than three drafts, even on \nthe most trivial correspondence. She, in turn, has gotten into \nthe bad habit of giving him drafts that can't be mailed any­\nway because of errors. \nExpect your secretary always to give you a letter ready for \nthe out-box. Before you make any changes, ask yourself \nwhether the time spent will significantly increase its value. As \nan added incentive against perfectionism, think about how \nmuch it's worth to you to have your letter in the hands of \nyour addressee rather than tied up in your office for another \nrevision. \nThe next time you catch yourself needlessly shuffling pa­\npers, remind yourself that the most important things often \nare not on paper at all. Ask yourself what underlying situa­\ntion the paper represents and how you would deal with it \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 81 \nCoping with Information Overload \nMany people also do not discriminate between A's and C's \nwhen it comes to keeping up with news in their field and \ncurrent events in general. Given a limited amount of time, \nwhat is the proper mix of reading the daily paper, weekly \nand monthly magazines, and books? Do you spend an hour a \nday on the paper, an hour a week on magazines, and an hour \na month on anything as heavy as a book? Or do you let the \ndaily and weekly events take care of themselves, focusing in­\nstead on monthlies and books by experts and specialists in a \nparticular discipline? \nThere is no \"right\" answer to such questions; just what you \ndecide is good for you. All I'm suggesting is that decisions be \nmade consciously and then be acted on. If you decide that it's \nnot worth more than ten minutes a day to read a newspaper, \nand you find yourself going back to an hour a day, question \nthe validity of your original decision. You may decide to give \na higher priority to newspapers. \nMany executives complain that they don't have enough \ntime to read books that would be useful to them in their \nwork. On the other hand, they find hours each month to read \nnewspapers. Perhaps it is because newspapers are widely \navailable each day, cost little, and are read as much for en­\ntertainment as for news. Books usually require an effort to \nobtain, cost much more, are considered substantial, and are \nread \"seriously.\" As a result, most executives read hundreds \nof newspapers a year and only a few books. \nReading Books Like Newspapers \nIf you feel the need to read more books for your work, try \nreading them as you would a newspaper, using the following \nprocedure. Each day have your secretary put one book from \na want-to-read (that you've given her) in your in-box. Have \nher take yesterday's book from your out-box. There is no \nharm in letting a book go to your out-box unread, since you \nwould probably never have even seen it previously. most profitably if you were on top of your paperwork. Then \n\"do it now.\" \n82 ALAN LAKE IN \nWhen you do pick up a book, start by reading the \"head­\nlines\" on the book jacket, where the publisher sets forth what \nhe considers most significant. Then glance through the book \nquickly, looking here and there for something of interest to \nyou",

    "text": " addition, you save the setup time required to famil­\niarize yourself with it again later on. \nNot all pieces of paper lend themselves to immediate and \nfinal action. Some papers linger for weeks or months and re­\nquire many actions spread over time before work on them is \ncomplete. In some projects every word counts and polishing \neach word is a good investment. Sometimes you make better \ndecisions if you put them off and think about them for a \nwhile. \nTherefore, the more comprehensive rule is 'Try to handle \neach piece of paper only once. If you can't, every time you \npick up a piece of paper do something to move ahead the \nproject it represents.*' If you can't take a big step, even the \nsmallest step counts. \nFor example, one executive might pick up a piece of paper \nand think, \"This represents an unpleasant task. I can't bring \nmyself to do it now, but the next time I pick it up I'll make \na phone call and get it started.\" He has done at least some­\nthing to move this project ahead by planning his next step. \nThe next time he finds the same paper in his hands, he is not \nlikely to put it down until he has made that phone call. \nOn the other hand, don't do more than is necessary. One \nsecretary complains that her boss is such a perfectionist that \nhe never gets a letter out in fewer than three drafts, even on \nthe most trivial correspondence. She, in turn, has gotten into \nthe bad habit of giving him drafts that can't be mailed any­\nway because of errors. \nExpect your secretary always to give you a letter ready for \nthe out-box. Before you make any changes, ask yourself \nwhether the time spent will significantly increase its value. As \nan added incentive against perfectionism, think about how \nmuch it's worth to you to have your letter in the hands of \nyour addressee rather than tied up in your office for another \nrevision. \nThe next time you catch yourself needlessly shuffling pa­\npers, remind yourself that the most important things often \nare not on paper at all. Ask yourself what underlying situa­\ntion the paper represents and how you would deal with it \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 81 \nCoping with Information Overload \nMany people also do not discriminate between A's and C's \nwhen",

Some papers linger for weeks or months and re­\nquire many actions spread over time before work on them is \ncomplete. In some projects every word counts and polishing \neach word is a good investment. Sometimes you make better \ndecisions if you put them off and think about them for a \nwhile. \nTherefore, the more comprehensive rule is 'Try to handle \neach piece of paper only once. If you can't, every time you \npick up a piece of paper do something to move ahead the \nproject it represents.*' If you can't take a big step, even the \nsmallest step counts. \nFor example, one executive might pick up a piece of paper \nand think, \"This represents an unpleasant task. I can't bring \nmyself to do it now, but the next time I pick it up I'll make \na phone call and get it started.\" He has done at least some­\nthing to move this project ahead by planning his next step. \nThe next time he finds the same paper in his hands, he is not \nlikely",

Given a limited amount of time, \nwhat is the proper mix of reading the daily paper, weekly \nand monthly magazines, and books? Do you spend an hour a \nday on the paper, an hour a week on magazines, and an hour \na month on anything as heavy as a book? Or do you let the \ndaily and weekly events take care of themselves, focusing in­\nstead on monthlies and books by experts and specialists in a \nparticular discipline? \nThere is no \"right\" answer to such questions; just what you \ndecide is good for you. All I'm suggesting is that decisions be \nmade consciously and then be acted on. If you decide that it's \nnot worth more than ten minutes a day to read a newspaper, \nand you find yourself going back to an hour a day, question \nthe validity of your original decision. You may decide to give \na higher priority to newspapers. \nMany executives complain that they don't have enough \ntime to read books that would be useful to them in their \nwork. On the other hand, they find hours each month to read \nnewspapers. Perhaps it is because newspapers are widely \navailable each day, cost little, and are read as much for en­\ntertainment as for news. Books usually require an effort to \nobtain, cost much more, are considered substantial, and are \nread \"seriously.\" As a result, most executives read hundreds \nof newspapers a year and only a few books. \nReading Books Like Newspapers \nIf you feel the need to read more books for your work, try \nreading them as you would a newspaper, using the following \nprocedure. Each day have your secretary put one book from \na want-to-read (that you've given her) in your in-box. Have \nher take yesterday's book from your out-box. There is no \nharm in letting a book go to your out-box unread, since you \nwould probably never have even seen it previously. most profitably if you were on top of your paperwork. Then \n\"do it now.\" \n82 ALAN LAKE IN \nWhen you do pick up",

You may decide to give \na higher priority to newspapers. \nMany executives complain that they don't have enough \ntime to read books that would be useful to them in their \nwork. On the other hand, they find hours each month to read \nnewspapers. Perhaps it is because newspapers are widely \navailable each day, cost little, and are read as much for en­\ntertainment as for news. Books usually require an effort to \nobtain, cost much more, are considered substantial, and are \nread \"seriously.\" As a result, most executives read hundreds \nof newspapers a year and only a few books. \nReading Books Like Newspapers \nIf you feel the need to read more books for your work, try \nreading them as you would a newspaper, using the following \nprocedure. Each day have your secretary put one book from \na want-to-read (that you've given her) in your in-box. Have \nher take yesterday's book from your out-box. There is no \nharm in letting a book go",

    "text": " a book, start by reading the \"head­\nlines\" on the book jacket, where the publisher sets forth what \nhe considers most significant. Then glance through the book \nquickly, looking here and there for something of interest to \nyou. Give yourself no more time than you would take to read \na newspaper. \nThe manner in which many non-fiction books are written \nsuggests an approach to reading them. The author starts with \na message he wants to convey, and summarizes it in a couple \nof sentences that he keeps in front of him as a guide while \nwriting. He develops this message with the aid of an outline, \nthen expands the ideas into enough pages to fill his book. \nYour job in reading a book, even if it has five hundred \npages or more, is to find these key ideas and understand their \napplication to your situation. The preface and table of con­\ntents, as well as summaries that are sometimes found at the \nbeginning and end of a book, will help you to do this quickly. \nRead the details only when something really meaningful to \nyou seems involved. In this way you can gain much value \nfrom a book in a surprisingly short time. \nThis method can help you upgrade the quality as well as \nincrease the quantity of books you read. Because more books \nare at least crossing your desk, you can feel comfortable in \nsetting aside one that has no appeal. On the other hand, with \nthe exposure to a number of different books, you are more \nlikely to come across ones that are worth careful study and \nwill repay an investment of several hours' time. \nPeople soon forget much of what they read. Therefore, \neven if you did read all details of a book, you would not be \nlikely to remember most of it anyway. If you've ever tried to \nsummarize a book to a friend, you'll probably agree that \nwhat you recalled and considered worth passing on were only \na few salient points. Since you remember little, it saves time \nto be selective and read only what is most likely to be worth \nremembering. \nOver the years you may have developed a library of books \nyou have found especially meaningful. Once you may have \nstudied these carefully, but with the passage of time much \nhas probably been forgotten. You may want to use the news­\npaper-reading method to review such books and refresh your \nmemory of the key ideas. \nSometimes you run across a book that may be useful in \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 83 \nthe future. Don't take time to read it now; you will have for­\ngotten the details by the time you need them. Instead, have \nyour secretary keep a note of the book in a special file for \nlater reference. One doctor, who formerly had his office piled \nhigh with unread books, and abstracts, switched to a 3x5 \ncard entry for each item and now has some room on his desk \nto read. \nIf you feel uncomfortable about the seeming superficiality \nof this approach to reading books, consider it a way of get­\nting started. Even at \"newspaper\" depth only, you are giving \nyourself a chance to absorb some useful new ideas. More­\nover, you may find that your business reading becomes more \nenjoyable because you're now able to read more in less time. \nShould You Try Speed-Reading? \nClearly, the faster you read, the more time you save. How­\never, I find that few people who take courses in speed-read­\ning manage to maintain much increase in their reading speed. \nThey can speed-read for a few weeks after the course, but \nmost of them soon revert to their former pace. If you have \nto do a great deal of reading, it may be worth taking a \nspeed-reading course, because studies indicate that if you \nread at least two hours every day after taking the course, \nyou'll be able to maintain a higher reading speed. \nBut I think it's more important to read smarter rather than \nfaster. In other words, cut out the C-reading that is unsatisfy­\ning, useless, uninformative, or uninteresting and use that ex­\ntra time and energy on A-reading (most likely at your \nformer reading pace). Since you won't read as much, it's im­\nportant to be selective about what you read. If you spend less \ntime reading C's, you'll find more time for the A's. \nMy wife and I have a hobby of reading aloud to each \nother. We read about twenty books a year this way. We \ncould sit down side by side and read the same books to our­\nselves in a fraction of the time if efficiency were our only \ngoal. The reason I tell this story is to",

    "text": " a book, start by reading the \"head­\nlines\" on the book jacket, where the publisher sets forth what \nhe considers most significant. Then glance through the book \nquickly, looking here and there for something of interest to \nyou. Give yourself no more time than you would take to read \na newspaper. \nThe manner in which many non-fiction books are written \nsuggests an approach to reading them. The author starts with \na message he wants to convey, and summarizes it in a couple \nof sentences that he keeps in front of him as a guide while \nwriting. He develops this message with the aid of an outline, \nthen expands the ideas into enough pages to fill his book. \nYour job in reading a book, even if it has five hundred \npages or more, is to find these key ideas and understand their \napplication to your situation. The preface and table of con­\ntents, as well as summaries that are sometimes found at the \nbeginning and end of a book, will help you to do this quickly. \nRead the details only when something really meaningful to \nyou seems involved. In this way you can gain much value \nfrom a book in a surprisingly short time. \nThis method can help you upgrade the quality as well as \nincrease the quantity of books you read. Because more books \nare at least crossing your desk, you can feel comfortable in \nsetting aside one that has no appeal. On the other hand, with \nthe exposure to a number of different books, you are more \nlikely to come across ones that are worth careful study and \nwill repay an investment of several hours' time. \nPeople soon forget much of what they read. Therefore, \neven if you did read all details of a book, you would not be \nlikely to remember most of it anyway. If you've ever tried to \nsummarize a book to a friend, you'll probably agree that \nwhat you recalled and considered worth passing on were only \na few salient points. Since you remember little, it saves time \nto be selective and read only what is most likely to be worth \nremembering. \nOver the years you may have developed a library of books \nyou have found especially meaningful. Once you may have \nstudied these carefully, but with the passage of time much \nhas probably been forgotten. You may want to use the news­\npaper-reading method to review such books and refresh your \nmemory of the key ideas. \nSometimes",

    "text": " a book, start by reading the \"head­\nlines\" on the book jacket, where the publisher sets forth what \nhe considers most significant. Then glance through the book \nquickly, looking here and there for something of interest to \nyou. Give yourself no more time than you would take to read \na newspaper. \nThe manner in which many non-fiction books are written \nsuggests an approach to reading them. The author starts with \na message he wants to convey, and summarizes it in a couple \nof sentences that he keeps in front of him as a guide while \nwriting. He develops this message with the aid of an outline, \nthen expands the ideas into enough pages to fill his book. \nYour job in reading a book, even if it has five hundred \npages or more, is to find these key ideas and understand their \napplication to your situation. The preface and table of con­\ntents, as well as summaries that are sometimes found at the \nbeginning and end of a book, will help you to do this quickly. \nRead the details only when something really meaningful to \nyou seems involved. In this way you can gain much value \nfrom a book in a surprisingly short time. \nThis method can help",

    "text": " may have \nstudied these carefully, but with the passage of time much \nhas probably been forgotten. You may want to use the news­\npaper-reading method to review such books and refresh your \nmemory of the key ideas. \nSometimes you run across a book that may be useful in \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 83 \nthe future. Don't take time to read it now; you will have for­\ngotten the details by the time you need them. Instead, have \nyour secretary keep a note of the book in a special file for \nlater reference. One doctor, who formerly had his office piled \nhigh with unread books, and abstracts, switched to a 3x5 \ncard entry for each item and now has some room on his desk \nto read. \nIf you feel uncomfortable about the seeming superficiality \nof this approach to reading books, consider it a way of get­\nting started. Even at \"newspaper\" depth only, you are giving \nyourself a chance to absorb some useful new ideas. More­\nover, you may find that your business reading becomes more \nenjoyable because you're now able to read more in less time. \nShould You Try Speed-Reading? \nClearly, the faster you read, the more time you save. How­\never, I find that few people who take courses in speed-read­\ning manage to maintain much increase in their reading speed. \nThey can speed-read for a few weeks after the course, but \nmost of them soon revert to their former pace. If you have \nto do a great deal of reading, it may be worth taking a \nspeed-reading course, because studies indicate that if you \nread at least two hours every day after taking the course, \nyou'll be able to maintain a higher reading speed. \nBut I think it's more important to read smarter rather than \nfaster. In other words, cut out the C-reading that is unsatisfy­\ning, useless, uninformative, or uninteresting and use that ex­\ntra time and energy on A-reading (most likely at your \nformer reading pace). Since you won't read as much, it's im­\nportant to be selective about what you read. If you spend less \ntime reading C's, you'll find more time for the A's. \nMy wife and I have a hobby of reading aloud to each \nother. We",

You may want to use the news­\npaper-reading method to review such books and refresh your \nmemory of the key ideas. \nSometimes you run across a book that may be useful in \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 83 \nthe future. Don't take time to read it now; you will have for­\ngotten the details by the time you need them. Instead, have \nyour secretary keep a note of the book in a special file for \nlater reference. One doctor, who formerly had his office piled \nhigh with unread books, and abstracts, switched to a 3x5 \ncard entry for each item and now has some room on his desk \nto read. \nIf you feel uncomfortable about the seeming superficiality \nof this approach to reading books, consider it a way of get­\nting started. Even at \"newspaper\" depth only, you are giving \nyourself a chance to absorb some useful new ideas. More­\nover, you may find that your business reading becomes more \nenjoyable because you're now able to read more in less time. \nShould You Try",
