Yourability to accurately identify these three key tasks and then to focuson them most of the time is essential for you to achieve at your best.\nLet me tell you a true story.\nThree months after her first full day coaching session with me in San\nDiego, Cynthia stood up and told the group a story. She said, “When\nI came here 90 days ago, you claimed that you would show me how\nto double my income and double my time off within 12 months. Thissounded completely unrealistic, but I was willing to give it a try.”\nShe went on. “On the first day, you asked me to write down a list of\neverything that I did over the course of a week or a month. I came up\nwith 17 tasks that I was responsible for. My problem was that I was\ncompletely overwhelmed with work. I was working 10 to 12 hours\nper day, six days per week, and not spending enough time with my\nhusband and my two young children. But I didn’t see any way out.”\n“I had been working for eight years for a fast-growing\nentrepreneurial company in the high-tech area, but there always\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 56seemed to be an overwhelming amount of work to do and never\nenough time.”\nOne Thing All Day Long\nShe continued with her story. “Once I had made up this list, you then\ntold me to ask this question, ‘If you could only do one thing on this\nlist, all day long, which one task would contribute the greatest valueto your company?’ Once I had identified that task, which was quiteeasy, I put a circle around that number.\n“You then asked, ‘If you could only do one more thing on your list of\nkey tasks, which would be the second activity that contributes the\nmost value to your company?’ “\n“Once I had identified the second most important task, you asked me\nthe same question with regard to the third most important task.\n“You then said something that shocked me at the time. You said that\nfully 90% of the value that you contribute to your company is\ncontained in those three tasks, whatever they are. Everything else\nyou do is either a support task or a complimentary task that could\nprobably be delegated, downsized, outsourced or eliminated.”\nTake Immediate Action\nCynthia continued with her story. “As I looked at the three tasks, I\nrealized that these were the three things that I did that contributed\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 57the most value to my company. This was on a Friday. On Monday\nmorning, at 10 o’clock, I met with my boss and explained to him\nwhat I had discovered. I told him that I needed his help in delegating\nand outsourcing all my work except for those three key tasks. I feltthat if I could work on those three tasks exclusively, all day long, Icould more than double my contribution to the company. Then I said\nto him that, if I doubled my contribution, I would like to be paid\ntwice as much.”\nShe said, “My boss was completely silent. He looked at my list of key\ntasks, looked back up at me, looked at the list again and then said\n‘Okay.’ It was now 10:21 AM according to the clock on the wallbehind him.”\n“He said, ‘You’re right, these are the three most important things that\nyou do in this company, and the three things that you do the best. Iwill help you to delegate and downsize all these other minor tasks to\nfree you up to work full time on these three key tasks. And if you\ndouble your contribution, I will pay you twice as much.”\nTransform Your Life\nCynthia concluded her story by saying, “He did, then I did, then he\ndid. He helped me delegate and assign my minor tasks so I could\nconcentrate on my top three jobs. As a result, I doubled my output\nover the next 30 days, and he doubled my income.”\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 58She said, “I had been working very hard for more than eight years\nand I doubled my income in less than one month by focusing all my\ntime and energy on my three key tasks. Not only that, instead of\nworking 10 and 12 hour days, I work from 8:00 to 5:00 and spendtime in the evenings and on the weekends with my husband and mychildren. Focusing on my key tasks has",

Yourability to accurately identify these three key tasks and then to focuson them most of the time is essential for you to achieve at your best.\nLet me tell you a true story.\nThree months after her first full day coaching session with me in San\nDiego, Cynthia stood up and told the group a story. She said, “When\nI came here 90 days ago, you claimed that you would show me how\nto double my income and double my time off within 12 months. Thissounded completely unrealistic, but I was willing to give it a try.”\nShe went on. “On the first day, you asked me to write down a list of\neverything that I did over the course of a week or a month. I came up\nwith 17 tasks that I was responsible for. My problem was that I was\ncompletely overwhelmed with work. I was working 10 to 12 hours\nper day, six days per week, and not spending enough time with my\nhusband and my two young children. But I didn’t see any way out.”\n“I had been working for eight years for a fast-growing\nentrepreneurial company in the high-tech area, but there always\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 56seemed to be an overwhelming amount of work to do and never\nenough time.”\nOne Thing All Day Long\nShe continued with her story. “Once I had made up this list, you then\ntold me to ask this question, ‘If you could only do one thing on this\nlist, all day long, which one task would contribute the greatest valueto your company?’ Once I had identified that task, which was quiteeasy, I put a circle around that number.\n“You then asked, ‘If you could only do one more thing on your list of\nkey tasks, which would be the second activity that contributes the\nmost value to your company?’ “\n“Once I had identified the second most important task, you asked me\nthe same question with regard to the third most important task.\n“You then said something that shocked me at the time. You said that\nfully 90% of the value that you contribute to your company",

You said that\nfully 90% of the value that you contribute to your company is\ncontained in those three tasks, whatever they are. Everything else\nyou do is either a support task or a complimentary task that could\nprobably be delegated, downsized, outsourced or eliminated.”\nTake Immediate Action\nCynthia continued with her story. “As I looked at the three tasks, I\nrealized that these were the three things that I did that contributed\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 57the most value to my company. This was on a Friday. On Monday\nmorning, at 10 o’clock, I met with my boss and explained to him\nwhat I had discovered. I told him that I needed his help in delegating\nand outsourcing all my work except for those three key tasks. I feltthat if I could work on those three tasks exclusively, all day long, Icould more than double my contribution to the company. Then I said\nto him that, if I doubled my contribution, I would like to be paid\ntwice as much.”\nShe said, “My boss was completely silent. He looked at my list of key\ntasks, looked back up at me, looked at the list again and then said\n‘Okay.’ It was now 10:21 AM according to the clock on the wallbehind him.”\n“He said, ‘You’re right, these are the three most important things that\nyou do in this company, and the three things that you do the best. Iwill help you to delegate and downsize all these other minor tasks to\nfree you up to work full time on these three key tasks. And if you\ndouble your contribution, I will pay you twice as much.”\nTransform Your Life\nCynthia concluded her story by saying, “He did, then I did, then he\ndid. He helped me delegate and assign my minor tasks so I could\nconcentrate on my top three jobs. As a result, I doubled my output\nover the next 30 days, and he doubled my income.”\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 58She said, “I had been working very hard for more than eight years\nand I doubled my income in less than one month by focusing all my\ntime and energy on my three key tasks.

He looked at my list of key\ntasks, looked back up at me, looked at the list again and then said\n‘Okay.’ It was now 10:21 AM according to the clock on the wallbehind him.”\n“He said, ‘You’re right, these are the three most important things that\nyou do in this company, and the three things that you do the best. Iwill help you to delegate and downsize all these other minor tasks to\nfree you up to work full time on these three key tasks. And if you\ndouble your contribution, I will pay you twice as much.”\nTransform Your Life\nCynthia concluded her story by saying, “He did, then I did, then he\ndid. He helped me delegate and assign my minor tasks so I could\nconcentrate on my top three jobs. As a result, I doubled my output\nover the next 30 days, and he doubled my income.”\nEAT",

    "text": " that, instead of\nworking 10 and 12 hour days, I work from 8:00 to 5:00 and spendtime in the evenings and on the weekends with my husband and mychildren. Focusing on my key tasks has transformed my life.”\nPerhaps the most important word in the world of work is\n“contribution.” Your rewards, both financial and emotional, willalways be in direct proportion to your results, to the value of your\ncontribution. If you want to increase your rewards, you must focus\non increasing the value of what you do. You must dedicate yourselfto contributing more results to your company. And there are always\nthree key tasks that contribute the most.\nThe Quick List Method\nHere is an exercise that we give to our coaching clients very early in\nthe process. We give them a sheet of paper and then ask them, “In 30\nseconds, write down your three most important goals in life, right\nnow.”\nWhat we have found is that when you only have 30 seconds to write\nyour three most important goals, your answers will be as accurate as\nif you had 30 minutes or three hours. Your subconscious mind seems\nto go into a form of “hyper-drive” and your three most important\ngoals will pop out of your head and onto the paper, often to the\nsurprise of the person doing the exercise.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 59In 80% or more of cases, the three common goals that most people\nhave are first, a financial and career goal; second, a family or personal\nrelationship goal; and third, a health or a fitness goal.\nAnd this is as it should be. These are the three most important areas\nof life. If you give yourself a grade on a scale of one to ten, with one\nbeing the lowest and ten being the highest, and apply this scale to\neach of these three areas, you can immediately identify where youare doing well in life and where you need some improvement. Try ityourself and see. Give this test to your spouse or your children. The\nanswers can be quite revealing.\nLater in our coaching program, we expand this exercise by asking the\nfollowing questions:\n1. What are your three most important business or career  goals,\nright now?\n2. What are your three most important family or relationship\ngoals, right now?\n3. What are your three most important financial goals, right now?\n4. What are your three most important health goals, right now?\n5. What are your three most important personal and professionaldevelopment goals, right now?\n6. What are your three most important social and community\ngoals, right now?\n7. What are your three biggest problems or concerns in life, right\nnow?\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 60When you force yourself to ask and answer these questions in 30\nseconds or less, you will often be amazed at the answers. Whatever\nyour answers, they will usually be an accurate snapshot of your true\nsituation in life at the moment. These answers will tell you what isreally important to you.\nWhile you are setting goals and priorities, getting organized,\nconcentrating single-mindedly on one task at a time, and discipliningyourself to complete your most important tasks, you must neverforget that your ultimate goal is to live a long, happy and healthy life.\nTime Management Is a Means to an End\nThe main reason that you develop time management skills is so that\nyou can get everything that is really important in your work\ncompleted so that you can free up more and more time to do thethings in your personal life that give you the greatest happiness and\nsatisfaction.\nFully 85% of your happiness in life will come from happy\nrelationships with other people, especially those closest to you, and\nthe members of your family. The critical determinant of the quality of\nyour relationships is the amount of time that you spend face to face\nwith the people you love, and who love you in return.\nThe purpose of time management skills, of eating that frog, and\ngetting more done in less time, is to enable you to spend more “face\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 61time” with the people you care about, doing the things that give you\nthe greatest amount of joy in life.\nRule: It is quality  of time at work that counts and quantity of time at\nhome that matters.\nWork All the Time You Work\nTo keep your life in balance, you should resolve to work all the time\nyou work. When you go to work, put your head down and work thewhole time. Start a little earlier, stay a little later, and work a littleharder. Don’t waste time. Every minute that you spend in idle chit\nchat with coworkers is time taken away from the work that you must\naccomplish if you want to keep your job.\nEven worse, time that you",

Focusing on my key tasks has transformed my life.”\nPerhaps the most important word in the world of work is\n“contribution.” Your rewards, both financial and emotional, willalways be in direct proportion to your results, to the value of your\ncontribution. If you want to increase your rewards, you must focus\non increasing the value of what you do. You must dedicate yourselfto contributing more results to your company. And there are always\nthree key tasks that contribute the most.\nThe Quick List Method\nHere is an exercise that we give to our coaching clients very early in\nthe process. We give them a sheet of paper and then ask them, “In 30\nseconds, write down your three most important goals in life, right\nnow.”\nWhat we have found is that when you only have 30 seconds to write\nyour three most important goals, your answers will be as accurate as\nif you had 30 minutes or three hours. Your subconscious mind seems\nto go into a form of “hyper-drive” and your three most important\ngoals will pop out of your head and onto the paper, often to the\nsurprise of the person doing the exercise.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 59In 80% or more of cases, the three common goals that most people\nhave are first, a financial and career goal; second, a family or personal\nrelationship goal; and third, a health or a fitness goal.\nAnd this is as it should be. These are the three most important areas\nof life. If you give yourself a grade on a scale of one to ten, with one\nbeing the lowest and ten being the highest, and apply this scale to\neach of these three areas, you can immediately identify where youare doing well in life and where you need some improvement. Try ityourself and see. Give this test to your spouse or your children. The\nanswers can be quite revealing.\nLater in our coaching program, we expand this exercise by asking the\nfollowing questions:\n1. What are your three most important business or career  goals,\nright now?\n2. What are your three most important family or relationship\ngoals, right now?\n3. What are your three most important financial goals, right now?\n4. What are your",

    "text": " littleharder. Don’t waste time. Every minute that you spend in idle chit\nchat with coworkers is time taken away from the work that you must\naccomplish if you want to keep your job.\nEven worse, time that you waste at work often has to be taken away\nfrom the members of your family. You either have to stay late or take\nwork home and work in the evenings. By not working effectively andefficiently during your workday, you create unnecessary stress and\nyou deprive the members of your family of the very best person you\ncan possibly be.\n There is a story of a little girl who goes to her mother and asks,\n“Mommy, why does daddy bring a briefcase full of work home each\nnight and never spends any time with the family?”\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 62The mother replies sympathetically, “Well honey, you have to\nunderstand, daddy can’t get his work done at the office so he has to\nbring it home and get caught up here.”\nThe little girl then asks, “If that’s the case, why don’t they put him in\na slower class?”\nBalance Is Not an Option\nOne of the most famous sayings of the ancient Greeks was\n“Moderation in all things.”\nYou need balance between your work and your personal life. You\nneed to set priorities at work and concentrate on your most valuable\ntasks. At the same time, you must never lose sight of the fact that the\nreason for working efficiently is so that you can enjoy a higherquality of life at home with your family.\nSometimes people come up to me and ask, “How do I achieve\nbalance between my work and my home life?”\nI ask them in return, “How often does a tight rope walker balance\nwhen he is on the high wire?”\nAfter a few seconds of thinking, they almost always say, “All the\ntime.”\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 63I say, “That is the same situation with balance between family and\nhome life. You have to do it all the time. You never reach a point\nwhere you have attained it perfectly. You have to work at it.”\nYour goal should be to perform at your very best at work, to get the\nvery most done and enjoy the very highest level of rewards possible\nfor you in your career. Simultaneously, you must always remember\nto “smell the flowers along the way.” Never lose sight of the realreasons why you work as hard as you do, and why you are sodetermined to accomplish the very most with the time that you\ninvest. The more time you spend face-to-face with the people you\nlove, the happier you will be.\nEat That Frog!\n1.  Determine the three most important things that you do in your\nwork. Ask, “If I could only do one thing all day long, which one task\ncontributes the greatest value to my career?” Do this exercise two\nmore times. Once you have identified your “Big Three” concentrate\non them single mindedly all day long.\n2.  Identify your three most important goals in life, in each area.\nOrganize them by priority. Make plans for their accomplishment, and\nwork on your plans every single day. You will be amazed at what\nyou achieve in the months and years ahead.",

    "text": " littleharder. Don’t waste time. Every minute that you spend in idle chit\nchat with coworkers is time taken away from the work that you must\naccomplish if you want to keep your job.\nEven worse, time that you waste at work often has to be taken away\nfrom the members of your family. You either have to stay late or take\nwork home and work in the evenings. By not working effectively andefficiently during your workday, you create unnecessary stress and\nyou deprive the members of your family of the very best person you\ncan possibly be.\n There is a story of a little girl who goes to her mother and asks,\n“Mommy, why does daddy bring a briefcase full of work home each\nnight and never spends any time with the family?”\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 62The mother replies sympathetically, “Well honey, you have to\nunderstand, daddy can’t get his work done at the office so he has to\nbring it home and get caught up here.”\nThe little girl then asks, “If that’s the case, why don’t they put him in\na slower class?”\nBalance Is Not an Option\nOne of the most famous sayings of the ancient Greeks was\n“Moderation in all things.”\nYou need balance between your work and your personal life. You\nneed to set priorities at work and concentrate on your most valuable\ntasks. At the same time, you must never lose sight of the fact that the\nreason for working efficiently is so that you can enjoy a higherquality of life at home with your family.\nSometimes people come up to me and ask, “How do I achieve\nbalance between my work and my home life?”\nI ask them in return, “How often does a tight rope walker balance\nwhen he is on the high wire?”\nAfter a few seconds of thinking, they almost always say, “All the\ntime.”\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 63I say, “That is the same situation with balance between family and\nhome life. You have to do it all the time. You never reach a point\nwhere you have attained it perfectly. You have to work at it.”\nYour goal should be to perform at your very best at work, to get the\nvery most done and enjoy the very highest level of rewards possible\nfor you in your career. Simultaneously, you must always remember\nto “smell the flowers along the way",
