    "text": "Reviewing: Keeping Your \nSystem Functional \nTHE PURPOSE OF this whole method of workflow manage ment is not \nto let your brain become lax, but rather to enable it to move \ntoward more elegant and productive activity. In ord er to earn that \nfreedom, however, your brain must engage on some co nsistent \nbasis with all your commitments and activities. You  must be \nassured that you're doing what you need to be doing , and that it's \nOK to be not doing what you're not doing. Reviewing your system \non a regular basis and keeping it current and funct ional are pre- \nrequisites for that kind of control. \nIf you have a list of calls you must make, for exam ple, the \nminute that list is not totally current with all the calls you need to \nmake, your brain will not trust the system, and it won't get relief \nfrom its lower-level mental tasks. It will have to take back the job \nof remembering, processing, and reminding, which, a s you should \nknow by now, it doesn't do very effectively. \nAll of this means your system cannot be static. In order to \nsupport appropriate action choices, it must be kept  up to date. \nAnd it should trigger consistent and appropriate ev aluation of \nyour life and work at several horizons. \nThere are two major issues that need to be handled at this point: \n• What do you look at in all this, and when? \n• What do you need to do, and how often, to ensure th at all of it \nworks as a consistent system, freeing you to think and manage at \na higher level? \n181 \nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY I  PART TWO \nA real review process will lead to enhanced and pro active \nnew thinking in key areas of your life and work. Su ch think- \ning emerges from both focused concentration and ser endipi- \ntous brainstorming, which will be triggered and gal vanized \nby a consistent personal review of your inventory o f actions and \nprojects. \nWhat to Look At, When \nYour personal system and behaviors need to be estab lished in such \na way that you can see all the action options you n eed to see, when \nyou need to see them. This is really just common se nse, but few \npeople actually have their processes and their orga nization honed \nto the point where they are as functional as they c ould be. \nWhen you have access to a phone and any discretiona ry \ntime, you ought to at least glance at the list of a ll the phone calls \nyou need to make, and then either direct yourself t o the best one \nto handle or give yourself permission to feel OK ab out not both- \nering with any of them. When you're about to go in for a discus- \nsion with your boss or your partner, take a moment to review the \noutstanding agendas you have with him or her, so yo u'll know that \nyou're using your time most effectively. When you n eed to pick up \nsomething at the dry cleaner's, first quickly revie w all the other \nerrands that you might be able to do en route. \nPeople often ask me, \"How much time do you \nspend looking at your system?\" My answer is simply,\n\"As much time as I need to to feel comfortable abou t \nwhat I'm doing.\" In actuality it's an accumulation of \ntwo seconds here, three seconds there. What most \npeople don't realize is that my lists are in one se nse \nmy office. Just as you might have Post-its and stac ks \nof phone slips at your workstation, so do I on my \n\"Next Actions\" lists. Assuming that you've complete ly collected, \nprocessed, and organized your stuff, you'll most li kely take only a \n182 A few seconds a \nday is usually all\nyou need for review, \nas long as you're \nlooking at the right \nthings at the right \ntime. \nCHAPTER 8  |  REVIEWING: KEEPING YOUR SYSTEM FUNCTIONAL \nfew brief moments here and there to access your sys tem for day- \nto-day reminders. \nLooking at Your Calendar First \nYour most frequent review will probably be of your daily calendar, \nand your daily tickler folder if you're maintaining  one, to see the \n\"hard landscape\" and assess what has to get done. Y ou need to \nknow the time-and-space parameters first. Knowing t hat you \nhave wall-to-wall meetings from 8:00 A.M. through 6:00 P.M., for \nexample, with barely a half-hour break for lunch, w ill help you \nmake necessary decisions about any other activities . \n. . .

    "text": "Reviewing: Keeping Your \nSystem Functional \nTHE PURPOSE OF this whole method of workflow manage ment is not \nto let your brain become lax, but rather to enable it to move \ntoward more elegant and productive activity. In ord er to earn that \nfreedom, however, your brain must engage on some co nsistent \nbasis with all your commitments and activities. You  must be \nassured that you're doing what you need to be doing , and that it's \nOK to be not doing what you're not doing. Reviewing your system \non a regular basis and keeping it current and funct ional are pre- \nrequisites for that kind of control. \nIf you have a list of calls you must make, for exam ple, the \nminute that list is not totally current with all the calls you need to \nmake, your brain will not trust the system, and it won't get relief \nfrom its lower-level mental tasks. It will have to take back the job \nof remembering, processing, and reminding, which, a s you should \nknow by now, it doesn't do very effectively. \nAll of this means your system cannot be static. In order to \nsupport appropriate action choices, it must be kept  up to date. \nAnd it should trigger consistent and appropriate ev aluation of \nyour life and work at several horizons. \nThere are two major issues that need to be handled at this point: \n• What do you look at in all this, and when? \n• What do you need to do, and how often, to ensure th at all of it \nworks as a consistent system, freeing you to think and manage at \na higher level? \n181 \nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY I  PART TWO \nA real review process will lead to enhanced and pro active \nnew thinking in key areas of your life and work. Su ch think- \ning emerges from both focused concentration and ser endipi- \ntous brainstorming, which will be triggered and gal vanized \nby a consistent personal review of your inventory o f actions and \nprojects. \nWhat to Look At, When \nYour personal system and behaviors need to be estab lished in such \na way that you can see all the action options you n eed to see, when \nyou need to see them. This is really just common se nse, but few \npeople actually have their processes and their orga nization honed \nto the",

    "text": ".M. through 6:00 P.M., for \nexample, with barely a half-hour break for lunch, w ill help you \nmake necessary decisions about any other activities . \n. . . Then Your Action Lists \nAfter you review all your day- and time-specific co mmitments \nand handle whatever you need to about them, your ne xt most fre- \nquent area for review will be the lists of all the actions you could \npossibly do in your current context. If you're in y our office, for \ninstance, you'll look at your lists of calls, compu ter actions, and in- \noffice things to do. This doesn't necessarily mean you will actually \nbe doing anything on those lists; you'll just evaluate them against \nthe flow of other work coming at you to ensure that  you make the \nbest choices about what to deal with. You need to f eel confident \nthat you're not missing anything critical. \nFrankly, if your calendar is trustworthy and your a ction lists \nare current, they may be the only things in the sys tem you'll need \nto refer to more than every couple of days. There h ave been many \ndays when I didn't need to look at any of my lists, in fact, because \nit was clear from the front end—my calendar—what I wouldn't \nbe \nable to do. \nThe Right Review in the Right Context \nYou may need to access any one of your lists at any  time. When \nyou and your spouse are decompressing at the end of  the day, \nand you want to be sure you'll take care of the \"bu siness\" the two \nof you manage together about home and family, you'l l want to \n183 \nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY |  PART TWO \nlook at your accumulated agendas for him or her. On  the other \nhand, if your boss pops in for a face-to-face conve rsation about \ncurrent realities and priorities, it will be highly  functional for you \nto have your \"Projects\" list up to date and your \"A genda\" list for \nhim or her right at hand. \nUpdating Your System \nThe real trick to ensuring the trustworthiness of th e whole organiza- \ntion system lies in regularly refreshing your psych e and your system \nfrom a more elevated perspective. That's impossible  to \ndo, however, if your lists fall too far behind your  reality. \nYou won't be able to fool yourself about this: if y our sys- \ntem is out of date, your brain will be forced to fu lly \nengage again at the lower level of remembering. \nThis is perhaps the biggest challenge of all. \nOnce you've tasted what it's like to have a clear h ead \nand feel in control of everything that's going on, can \nyou do what you need to to maintain that as an \noperational standard? The many years I've spent \nresearching and implementing this  methodology \nwith countless people have proved to me that the ma gic key to the \nsustainability of the process is the Weekly Review.\nThe Power of the Weekly Review \nIf you're like me and most other people, no matter how good your \nintentions may be, you're going to have the world c ome at you \nfaster than you can keep up. Many of us seem to hav e it in our \nnatures consistently to entangle ourselves in more than we have \nthe ability to handle. We book ourselves back to ba ck in meetings \nall day, go to after-hours events that generate ide as and commit- \nments we need to deal with, and get embroiled in en gagements \nand projects that have the potential to spin our cr eative intelli- \ngence into cosmic orbits. 1\n184 To make \nknowledge \nproductive, we \nwill have to learn \nto see both forest \nand tree. We will \nhave to learn to \nconnect. \n—Peter F. \nCHAPTER 8  |  REVIEWING: KEEPING YOUR SYSTEM FUNCTIONAL \nThat whirlwind of activity is precisely what makes the \nWeekly Review so valuable. It builds in some captur ing, reeval- \nuation, and reprocessing time to keep you in bal- \nance. There is simply no way to do this necessary \nregrouping while you're trying to get everyday work\ndone. \nThe Weekly Review will also sharpen your intu- \nitive focus on your important projects as you deal \nwith the flood of new input and potential distrac- \ntions coming at you the rest of the week. You're go ing \nto have to learn to say no—faster, and to more thin gs—in order to \nstay afloat and comfortable. Having some dedicated time in \nwhich to at least get up to the project level of th inking goes a long \n",

Then Your Action Lists \nAfter you review all your day- and time-specific co mmitments \nand handle whatever you need to about them, your ne xt most fre- \nquent area for review will be the lists of all the actions you could \npossibly do in your current context. If you're in y our office, for \ninstance, you'll look at your lists of calls, compu ter actions, and in- \noffice things to do. This doesn't necessarily mean you will actually \nbe doing anything on those lists; you'll just evaluate them against \nthe flow of other work coming at you to ensure that  you make the \nbest choices about what to deal with. You need to f eel confident \nthat you're not missing anything critical. \nFrankly, if your calendar is trustworthy and your a ction lists \nare current, they may be the only things in the sys tem you'll need \nto refer to more than every couple of days. There h ave been many \ndays when I didn't need to look at any of my lists, in fact, because \nit was clear from the front end—my calendar—what I wouldn't \nbe \nable to do. \nThe Right Review in the Right Context \nYou may need to access any one of your lists at any  time.

    "text": " trick to ensuring the trustworthiness of th e whole organiza- \ntion system lies in regularly refreshing your psych e and your system \nfrom a more elevated perspective. That's impossible  to \ndo, however, if your lists fall too far behind your  reality. \nYou won't be able to fool yourself about this: if y our sys- \ntem is out of date, your brain will be forced to fu lly \nengage again at the lower level of remembering. \nThis is perhaps the biggest challenge of all. \nOnce you've tasted what it's like to have a clear h ead \nand feel in control of everything that's going on, can \nyou do what you need to to maintain that as an \noperational standard? The many years I've spent \nresearching and implementing this  methodology \nwith countless people have proved to me that the ma gic key to the \nsustainability of the process is the Weekly Review.\nThe Power of the Weekly Review \nIf you're like me and most other people, no matter how good your \nintentions may be, you're going to have the world c ome at you \nfaster than you can keep up. Many of us seem to hav e it in our \nnatures consistently to entangle ourselves in more than we have \nthe ability to handle. We book ourselves back to ba ck in meetings \nall day, go to after-hours events that generate ide as and commit- \nments we need to deal with, and get embroiled in en gagements \nand projects that have the potential to spin our cr eative intelli- \ngence into cosmic orbits. 1\n184 To make \nknowledge \nproductive, we \nwill have to learn \nto see both forest \nand tree. We will \nhave to learn to \nconnect. \n—Peter F. \nCHAPTER 8  |  REVIEWING: KEEPING YOUR SYSTEM FUNCTIONAL \nThat whirlwind of activity is precisely what makes the \nWeekly Review so valuable. It builds in some captur ing, reeval- \nuation, and reprocessing time to keep you in bal- \nance. There is simply no way to do this necessary \nregrouping while you're trying to get everyday work\ndone. \nThe Weekly Review will also sharpen your intu- \nitive focus on your important projects as you deal \nwith the flood of new input and potential distrac- \ntions coming at you the rest of the week.

    "text": "to have to learn to say no—faster, and to more thin gs—in order to \nstay afloat and comfortable. Having some dedicated time in \nwhich to at least get up to the project level of th inking goes a long \nway toward making that easier. \nWhat Is the Weekly Review? \nVery simply, the Weekly Review is whatever you need  to do to get \nyour head empty again. It's going through the five phases of \nworkflow management—collecting, processing, organiz ing, and \nreviewing all your outstanding involvements—until y ou can hon- \nestly say, \"I absolutely know right now everything I'm not doing \nbut could be doing if I decided to.\" \nFrom a nitty-gritty, practical standpoint, here is the drill that \ncan get you there: \nLoose Papers Pull out all miscellaneous scraps of paper, busines s \ncards, receipts, and so on that have crept into the  crevices of your \ndesk, clothing, and accessories. Put it all into yo ur in-basket for \nprocessing. \nProcess Your Notes Review any journal entries, meeting notes, or \nmiscellaneous notes scribbled on notebook paper. Li st action \nitems, projects, waiting-fors, calendar events, and  someday/ \nmaybes, as appropriate. File any reference notes an d materials. \nStage your \"Read/Renew\" material. Be ruthless with yourself, \n185 You will invariably \ntake in more \nopportunities than \nyour system can \nprocess on a daily \nbasis.\n186 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY |  PART TWO \nprocessing all notes and thoughts relative to inter actions, projects, \nnew initiatives, and input that have come your way since your last \ndownload, and purging those not needed. \nPrevious Calendar Data Review past calendar dates in detail for \nremaining action items, reference information, and so on, and \ntransfer that data into the active system. Be able to archive your \nlast week's calendar with nothing left uncaptured. \nUpcoming Calendar Look at future calendar events (long- and \nshort-term). Capture actions about arrangements and  prepara- \ntions for any upcoming events. \nEmpty Your Head Put in writing (in appropriate categories) any \nnew projects, action items, waiting-fors, someday/m aybes, and so \nforth that you haven't yet captured. \nReview \"Projects\" (and Larger Outcome) Lists Evaluate the status \nof projects, goals, and outcomes one by one, ensuri ng that at least \none current kick-start action for each is in your s ystem. \nReview \"Next Actions\"Lists Mark off completed actions. Review \nfor reminders of further action steps to capture. \nReview \"Waiting For\" List Record appropriate actions for any \nneeded follow-up. Check off received items. \nReview Any Relevant Checklists Is there anything you haven't \ndone that you need to do? \nReview \"Someday/Maybe\" List Check for any projects that may \nhave become active and transfer them to \"Projects.\"  Delete items \nno longer of interest. \nCHAPTER 8  |  REVIEWING: KEEPING YOUR SYSTEM FUNCTIONAL \nReview \"Pending\" and Support Files Browse through all work- \nin-progress support material to trigger new actions , completions, \nand waiting-fors. \nBe Creative and Courageous Are there any new, wonderful, hare- \nbrained, creative, thought-provoking, risk-taking i deas you can \nadd to your system? \nThis review process is common sense, but few \nof us do it as well as we could, and that means as \nregularly as we should to keep a clear mind and a \nsense of relaxed control. \nThe Right Time and Place for the Review \nThe Weekly Review is so critical that it behooves y ou \nto establish good habits, environments, and tools t o \nsupport it. Once your comfort zone has been estab- \nlished for the kind of relaxed control that Getting \nThings Done is all about, you won't have to worry too \nmuch about making yourself do your review—you'll \nhave to to get back to your personal standards again. \nUntil then, do whatever you need to, once a \nweek, to trick yourself into backing away from the \ndaily grind for a couple of hours—not to zone out, \nbut to rise up at least to \"10,000 feet\" and catch up. \nIf you have the luxury of an office or work space \nthat can be somewhat isolated from the people and i nteractions of \nthe day, and if you have anything resembling a typi cal Monday- \nto-Friday workweek, I recommend that you block out two hours \nearly every Friday afternoon for the review. Three factors make \nthis an ideal time: \n• The events of the week are likely to be still fre sh enough for you \nto be able",

It's going through the five phases of \nworkflow management—collecting, processing, organiz ing, and \nreviewing all your outstanding involvements—until y ou can hon- \nestly say, \"I absolutely know right now everything I'm not doing \nbut could be doing if I decided to.\" \nFrom a nitty-gritty, practical standpoint, here is the drill that \ncan get you there: \nLoose Papers Pull out all miscellaneous scraps of paper, busines s \ncards, receipts, and so on that have crept into the  crevices of your \ndesk, clothing, and accessories.

    "text": " workweek, I recommend that you block out two hours \nearly every Friday afternoon for the review. Three factors make \nthis an ideal time: \n• The events of the week are likely to be still fre sh enough for you \nto be able to do a complete postmortem (\"Oh, yeah, I need to \nmake sure I get back to her about...\"). \n187 \"Point of view\" \nis that qulnt- \nessentially human \nsolution to \ninformation \noverload, an \nintuitive process of \nreducing things to \nan essential \nrelevant and \nmanageable \nminimum. . . . In \na world of \nhyperabundant \ncontent, point of \nview will become \nthe scarcest of \nresources. \n—Paul \n188 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY |  PART TWO \n•When you (invariably) uncover actions that require  reaching \npeople at work, you'll still have time to do that b efore they leave \nfor the weekend. \n• It's great to clear your psychic decks so you can  go into the \nweekend ready for refreshment and recreation, with nothing on \nyour mind. \nYou may be the kind of person, however, who doesn't  have \nnormal weekends. I, for example, often have as much  to do on \nSaturday and Sunday as on Wednesday. But I do have the \nluxury(?) of frequent long plane trips, which provi de an ideal \nopportunity for me to catch up. A good friend and c lient of mine, \nan executive in the world's largest aerospace compa ny, has his own \nSunday-night ritual of relaxing in his home office and processing \nthe hundreds of notes he's generated during his wee k of back-to- \nback meetings. \nWhatever your life-style, you need a weekly regroup ing \nritual. You likely have something like this (or clo se to it) already. If \nso, leverage the habit by adding into it a higher-a ltitude review \nprocess. \nThe people who find it hardest to make time for thi s review \nare those who have constantly on-demand work and ho me envi- \nronments, with zero built-in time or space for regr ouping. The \nmost stressed professionals I have met are the ones  who have to be \nmission-critically reactive at work (e.g., high-lev el equities traders \nand chiefs of staff) and then go home to a couple o f under-ten- \nyear-old children and a spouse who also works. The more fortunate \nof them have a one-hour train commute. \nIf you recognize yourself in that picture, your gre atest chal- \nlenge will be to build in a consistent process of r egrouping, when \nyour world is not directly in your face. You'll nee d to either accept \nthe requirement of an after-hours time at your desk  on a Friday \nnight or establish a relaxed but at-work kind of lo cation and time \nat home. \nCHAPTER 8  I  REVIEWING: KEEPING YOUR SYSTEM FUNCTIONAL \nExecutive Operational Review Time I've coached many execu- \ntives to block out two hours on their calendars on Fridays. For \nthem the biggest problem is how to balance quality thinking and \ncatch-up time with the urgent demands of mission-cr itical inter- \nactions. This is a tough call. The most senior and savvy of them, \nhowever, know the value of sacrificing the seemingl y \nurgent for the truly important, and they create the ir \nislands of time for some version of this process. \nEven the executives who have integrated a con- \nsistent reflective time for their work, though, oft en \nseem to give short shrift to the more mundane revie w \nand catch-up process at the \"10,000-foot\" level. Be tween wall-to- \nwall meetings and ambling around your koi pond with  a chardon- \nnay at sunset, there's got to be a slightly elevate d level of reflection \nand regrouping required for operational control and\nfocus. If you think you have all your open loops fu lly \nidentified, clarified, assessed, and actionalized, you're \nprobably kidding yourself. \nThe \"Bigger Picture\" Reviews \nYes, at some point you must clarify the larger out-\ncomes, the long-term goals, the visions and princi-\nples that ultimately drive and test your decisions.\nWhat are your key goals and objectives in your \nwork? What should you have in place a year or three\nyears from now? How is your career going? Is this t he \nlife-style that is most fulfilling to you? Are you doing \nwhat you really want or need to do, from a deeper \nand longer-term perspective? \nThe explicit focus of this book is not at those \n",

I, for example, often have as much  to do on \nSaturday and Sunday as on Wednesday. But I do have the \nluxury(?) of frequent long plane trips, which provi de an ideal \nopportunity for me to catch up. A good friend and c lient of mine, \nan executive in the world's largest aerospace compa ny, has his own \nSunday-night ritual of relaxing in his home office and processing \nthe hundreds of notes he's generated during his wee k of back-to- \nback meetings. \nWhatever your life-style, you need a weekly regroup ing \nritual. You likely have something like this (or clo se to it) already. If \nso, leverage the habit by adding into it a higher-a ltitude review \nprocess. \nThe people who find it hardest to make time for thi s review \nare those who have constantly on-demand work and ho me envi- \nronments, with zero built-in time or space for regr ouping.

The \nmost stressed professionals I have met are the ones  who have to be \nmission-critically reactive at work (e.g., high-lev el equities traders \nand chiefs of staff) and then go home to a couple o f under-ten- \nyear-old children and a spouse who also works. The more fortunate \nof them have a one-hour train commute. \nIf you recognize yourself in that picture, your gre atest chal- \nlenge will be to build in a consistent process of r egrouping, when \nyour world is not directly in your face. You'll nee d to either accept \nthe requirement of an after-hours time at your desk  on a Friday \nnight or establish a relaxed but at-work kind of lo cation and time \nat home. \nCHAPTER 8  I  REVIEWING: KEEPING YOUR SYSTEM FUNCTIONAL \nExecutive Operational Review Time I've coached many execu- \ntives to block out two hours on their calendars on Fridays. For \nthem the biggest problem is how to balance quality thinking and \ncatch-up time with the urgent demands of mission-cr itical inter- \nactions. This is a tough call. The most senior and savvy of them, \nhowever, know the value of sacrificing the seemingl y \nurgent for the truly important, and they create the ir \nislands of time for some version of this process. \nEven the executives who have integrated a con- \nsistent reflective time for their work, though, oft en \nseem to give short shrift to the more mundane revie w \nand catch-up process at the \"10,000-foot\" level. Be tween wall-to- \nwall meetings and ambling around your koi pond with  a chardon- \nnay at sunset, there's got to be a slightly elevate d level of reflection \nand regrouping required for operational control and\nfocus. If you think you have all your open loops fu lly \nidentified, clarified, assessed, and actionalized, you're \nprobably kidding yourself. \nThe \"Bigger Picture\" Reviews \nYes, at some point you must clarify the larger out-\ncomes, the long-term goals, the visions and princi-\nples that ultimately drive and test your decisions.\nWhat are your key goals and objectives in your \nwork? What should you have in place a year or three\nyears from now? How is your career",

The more fortunate \nof them have a one-hour train commute. \nIf you recognize yourself in that picture, your gre atest chal- \nlenge will be to build in a consistent process of r egrouping, when \nyour world is not directly in your face.

As you increase the speed and  agility with \nwhich you clear the \"runway\" and \"10,000-foot\" leve ls of your life \nand work, be sure to revisit the other levels you'r e engaged in, now \nand then, to maintain a truly clear head. \nHow often you ought to challenge yourself with that  type of \nwide-ranging review is something only you can know.  The princi- \nple I must affirm at this juncture is this: \nYou need to assess your life and work at the approp riate hori- \nzons, making the appropriate decisions, at the appr opriate intervals, \nin order to really come clean. \nWhich brings us to the ultimate point and challenge  of all this \npersonal collecting, processing, organizing, and re viewing method- \nology: It's 9:22 A.M.

Or your spirit. Or, if you're allergic to th ose \nkinds of words, try these: your gut, the seat of yo ur \npants, your intuition. \nThat doesn't mean you throw your life to the \nwinds—unless, of course, it does. I actually went \ndown that route myself with some vengeance at one \npoint in my life, and I can attest that the lessons  were \nvaluable, if not necessarily necessary.* \nAs outlined in chapter 2 (pages 48-53), I have \nfound three priority frameworks to be enormously he lpful in the \ncontext of deciding actions: \n• The four-criteria model for choosing actions in the  moment \n• The threefold model for evaluating daily work \n• The six-level model for reviewing your own work \n*There are various ways to give it all up. You can ignore the physical world and \nits realities and trust in the universe. I did that , and it was a powerful experi- \nence. And one I wouldn't wish on anyone. Surrenderi ng to your inner aware- \nness, however, and its intelligence and practicalit y in the worlds you live in, is \nthe higher ground. Trusting yourself and the source  of your intelligence is a \nmore elegant version of freedom and personal produc tivity. \n191 Ultimately and \nalways you must\ntrust your intuition.\nThere are many \nthings you can do,\nhowever, that can \nincrease that trust.\n192 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  |  PART TWO \nThese happen to be shown in reverse hierarchical or der—\nthat is, the reverse of the typical strategic top-d own perspective. \nIn keeping with the nature of the Getting Things Done method- \nology, I have found it useful to once again work fr om the bottom, \nup, meaning I'll start with the most mundane levels . \nThe Four-Criteria Model for \nChoosing Actions in the Moment \nRemember that you make your action choices based on  the fol- \nlowing four criteria, in order: \n1 | Context \n2 | Time available \n3 | Energy available \n4 | Priority \nLet's examine each of these in the light of how you  can best \nstructure your systems and behaviors to take advant age of its \ndynamics. \nContext \nAt any point in time, the first thing to consider i s, what could you \npossibly do, where you are, with the tools you have ?

    "text": ", get- it-done work- \nday, how do you decide what to do at any given poin t? \nAs I've said, my simple answer is, trust your \nheart. Or your spirit. Or, if you're allergic to th ose \nkinds of words, try these: your gut, the seat of yo ur \npants, your intuition. \nThat doesn't mean you throw your life to the \nwinds—unless, of course, it does. I actually went \ndown that route myself with some vengeance at one \npoint in my life, and I can attest that the lessons  were \nvaluable, if not necessarily necessary.* \nAs outlined in chapter 2 (pages 48-53), I have \nfound three priority frameworks to be enormously he lpful in the \ncontext of deciding actions: \n• The four-criteria model for choosing actions in the  moment \n• The threefold model for evaluating daily work \n• The six-level model for reviewing your own work \n*There are various ways to give it all up. You can ignore the physical world and \nits realities and trust in the universe. I did that , and it was a powerful experi- \nence. And one I wouldn't wish on anyone. Surrenderi ng to your inner aware- \nness, however, and its intelligence and practicalit y in the worlds you live in, is \nthe higher ground. Trusting yourself and the source  of your intelligence is a \nmore elegant version of freedom and personal produc tivity. \n191 Ultimately and \nalways you must\ntrust your intuition.\nThere are many \nthings you can do,\nhowever, that can \nincrease that trust.\n192 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  |  PART TWO \nThese happen to be shown in reverse hierarchical or der—\nthat is, the reverse of the typical strategic top-d own perspective. \nIn keeping with the nature of the Getting Things Done method- \nology, I have found it useful to once again work fr om the bottom, \nup, meaning I'll start with the most mundane levels . \nThe Four-Criteria Model for \nChoosing Actions in the Moment \nRemember that you make your action choices based on  the fol- \nlowing four criteria, in order: \n1 | Context \n2 | Time available \n3 | Energy available \n4 | Priority \nLet's examine each of these in the light of how you  can best \nstructure your systems and behaviors to take",

    "text": ", get- it-done work- \nday, how do you decide what to do at any given poin t? \nAs I've said, my simple answer is, trust your \nheart. Or your spirit. Or, if you're allergic to th ose \nkinds of words, try these: your gut, the seat of yo ur \npants, your intuition. \nThat doesn't mean you throw your life to the \nwinds—unless, of course, it does. I actually went \ndown that route myself with some vengeance at one \npoint in my life, and I can attest that the lessons  were \nvaluable, if not necessarily necessary.* \nAs outlined in chapter 2 (pages 48-53), I have \nfound three priority frameworks to be enormously he lpful in the \ncontext of deciding actions: \n• The four-criteria model for choosing actions in the  moment \n• The threefold model for evaluating daily work \n• The six-level model for reviewing your own work \n*There are various ways to give it all up. You can ignore the physical world and \nits realities and trust in the universe. I did that , and it was a powerful experi- \nence. And one I wouldn't wish on",

Do you have a \nphone? Do you have access to the person you need to  talk with \nface-to-face about three agenda items? Are you at t he store where \nyou need to buy something? If you can't do the acti on because \nyou're not in the appropriate location or don't hav e the appropri- \nate tool, don't worry about it. \nAs I've said, you should always organize your actio n \nreminders by context—\"Calls,\" \"At Home,\" \"At Comput er,\" \n\"Errands,\" \"Agenda for Joe,\" \"Agenda for Staff Meet ing,\" and \nso on. Since context is the first criterion that co mes into play in \nyour choice of actions, context-sorted lists preven t unnecessary \nCHAPTER 9  |  DOING: MAKING THE BEST ACTION CHOICES \nreassessments about what to do. If you have a bunch  of things to \ndo on one to-do list, but you actually can't do man y of them in the \nsame context, you force yourself to continually kee p reconsidering \nall of them. \nIf you're stuck in traffic, and the only actions yo u can take are \ncalls on your cell phone, you want to be able to pu ll out just your \n\"Calls\" list. Your action lists should fold in or o ut, based on what \nyou could possibly do at any time. \nA second real benefit accrues from organizing all y our \nactions by the physical context needed: that in itself forces you to \nmake the all-important determination about the next  physical \naction on your stuff. All of my action lists are se t up this way, so I \nhave to decide on the very next physical action bef ore I can know \nwhich list to put an item on (is this something tha t requires the \ncomputer? a phone? being in a store?). People who g ive them- \nselves a \"Misc.\" action list (i.e., one not specifi c to a context) often \nlet themselves slide in the next-action decision, t oo. \nI frequently encourage clients to structure their l ist catego- \nries early on as they're processing their in-basket s, because that \nautomatically grounds their projects in the real th ings that need to \nget done to get them moving. \nTime Available \nThe second factor in choosing an action is how much  time you \nhave before you have to do something else. If your meeting is \nstarting in ten minutes, you'll most likely select a different action \nto do right now than you would if the next couple o f hours were \nclear. \nObviously, it's good to know how much time you have  at \nhand (hence the emphasis on calendar and watch). A total-life \naction-reminder inventory will give you maximum inf ormation \nabout what you need to do, and make it much easier to match \nyour actions to the windows you have. In other word s, if you have \nten minutes before that next meeting, find a ten-mi nute thing to \ndo. If your lists have only the \"big\" or \"important \" things on them, \n193 \nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY I  PART TWO \nno item listed may be possible to handle in a ten-m inute period. If \nyou're going to have to do those shorter action thi ngs anyway, the \nmost productive way to get them done is to utilize the little \"weird \ntime\" windows that occur throughout the day. \nEnergy Available \nAlthough you can increase your energy level at time s \nby changing your context and redirecting your focus , \nyou can do only so much. The tail end of a day take n \nup mostly by a marathon budget-planning session is \nprobably not the best time to call a prospective cl ient \nor start drafting a performance-review policy. It \nmight be better to call the airline to change a res erva- \ntion, process some expense receipts, or skim a trad e \njournal. \nJust as having all your next-action options availab le allows \nyou to take advantage of various time slots, knowin g about every- \nthing you're going to need to process and do at som e point \nwill allow you to match productive activity with yo ur vitality \nlevel. \nI recommend that you always keep an inventory of th ings \nthat need to be done that require very little menta l or creative \nhorsepower. When you're in one of those low-energy states, \ndo them. Casual reading (magazines, articles, and c atalogs), \ntelephone/address data that need to be inputted ont o your",

If you can't do the acti on because \nyou're not in the appropriate location or don't hav e the appropri- \nate tool, don't worry about it. \nAs I've said, you should always organize your actio n \nreminders by context—\"Calls,\" \"At Home,\" \"At Comput er,\" \n\"Errands,\" \"Agenda for Joe,\" \"Agenda for Staff Meet ing,\" and \nso on.

If your meeting is \nstarting in ten minutes, you'll most likely select a different action \nto do right now than you would if the next couple o f hours were \nclear. \nObviously, it's good to know how much time you have  at \nhand (hence the emphasis on calendar and watch). A total-life \naction-reminder inventory will give you maximum inf ormation \nabout what you need to do, and make it much easier to match \nyour actions to the windows you have. In other word s, if you have \nten minutes before that next meeting, find a ten-mi nute thing to \ndo.

If \nyou're going to have to do those shorter action thi ngs anyway, the \nmost productive way to get them done is to utilize the little \"weird \ntime\" windows that occur throughout the day. \nEnergy Available \nAlthough you can increase your energy level at time s \nby changing your context and redirecting your focus , \nyou can do only so much. The tail end of a day take n \nup mostly by a marathon budget-planning session is \nprobably not the best time to call a prospective cl ient \nor start drafting a performance-review policy. It \nmight be better to call the airline to change a res erva- \ntion, process some expense receipts, or skim a trad e \njournal. \nJust as having all your next-action options availab le allows \nyou to take advantage of various time slots, knowin g about every- \nthing you're going to need to process and do at som e point \nwill allow you to match productive activity with yo ur vitality \nlevel. \nI recommend that you always keep an inventory of th ings \nthat need to be done that require very little ment",

Casual reading (magazines, articles, and c atalogs), \ntelephone/address data that need to be inputted ont o your com- \nputer, file purging, backing up your laptop, even j ust watering \nyour plants and filling your stapler—these are some  of the myriad \nthings that you've got to deal with sometime anyway . \nThis is one of the best reasons for having very \nclean edges to your personal management system: it \nmakes it easy to continue doing productive activity\nwhen you're not in top form. If you're in a low-ene rgy \nmode and your reading material is disorganized, you r \nreceipts are all over the place, your filing system  is \nchaotic, and your in-basket is dysfunctional, it ju st \n194 We all have times \n•when we think \nmore effectively, \nand times when \nwe should not be \nthinking at all. \n—Daniel Cohen \nThere is no reason \nnot to be highly \nproductive, even \nwhen you're not in \ntop form. \nCHAPTER 9  |  DOING: MAKING THE BEST ACTION CHOICES \nseems like too much work to do to find and organize  the tasks at \nhand; so you simply avoid doing anything at all and  then you feel \neven worse. One of the best ways to increase your energy is to \nclose some of your loops. So always be sure to have  some easy \nloops to close, right at hand. \nThese first three criteria for choosing action (con text, time, and \nenergy) bespeak the need for a complete next-action  reminder \nsystem. Sometimes you won't be in a mode to do that  kind of \n■ thinking; it needs to have already been done. If i t is, you can oper- \nate much more \"in your zone\" and choose from deline ated actions \nthat fit the situation. \nPriority \nGiven the context you're in and the time and energy  you have, the \nobvious next criterion for action choice is relativ e priority: \"Out of \nall my remaining options, what is the most importan t thing for \nme to do?\" \n\"How do I decide my priorities?\" is a question I \nfrequently hear from people I'm working with. It \nsprings from their experience of having more on the ir \nplate to do than they can comfortably handle. They \nknow that some hard choices have to be made, and \nthat some things may not get done at all. \nAt the end of the day, in order to feel good about \nwhat you didn't get done, you must have made some c onscious \ndecisions about your responsibilities, goals, and v alues. That \nprocess invariably includes an often complex interp lay with the \ngoals, values, and directions of your organization and of the other \nsignificant people in your life, and with the impor tance of those \nrelationships to you. \n195 It is impossible to \nfeel good about\nyour choices unless \nyou are clear about\nwhat your work \nreally is.\n196 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY |  PART TWO \nThe Threefold Model for \nEvaluating Daily Work \nSetting priorities assumes that some things will be  more important \nthan others, but important relative to what? In thi s context, the \nanswer is, to your work—that is, the job you have a ccepted from \nyourself and/or from others. This is where the next  two frameworks \nneed to be brought to bear in your thinking. They'r e about defining \nyour work. Keep in mind that though much of this me thodology \nwill be within the arena of your professional focus , I'm using \"work\" \nin the universal sense, to mean anything you have a  commitment to \nmaking happen, personally as well as professionally . \nThese days, daily work activity itself presents a r elatively new \ntype of challenge to most professionals, something that it's help- \nful to understand as we endeavor to build the most productive \nsystems. As I explained earlier, during the course of the workday, \nat any point in time, you'll be engaged in one of t hree types of \nactivities: \n• Doing predefined work \n• Doing work as it shows up \n• Defining your work \nYou may be doing things on your action lists, doing  things as \nthey come up, or processing incoming inputs to dete rmine what \nwork that needs to be done, either then or later, f rom your lists. \nThis is common sense. But many people let themselve s get \nwrapped around the second activity—dealing with thi ngs that \nshow up ad hoc—much too easily, and let the other t wo slide, to \ntheir detriment.",

One of the best ways to increase your energy is to \nclose some of your loops. So always be sure to have  some easy \nloops to close, right at hand. \nThese first three criteria for choosing action (con text, time, and \nenergy) bespeak the need for a complete next-action  reminder \nsystem. Sometimes you won't be in a mode to do that  kind of \n■ thinking; it needs to have already been done. If i t is, you can oper- \nate much more \"in your zone\" and choose from deline ated actions \nthat fit the situation. \nPriority \nGiven the context you're in and the time and energy  you have, the \nobvious next criterion for action choice is relativ e priority: \"Out of \nall my remaining options,",

They \nknow that some hard choices have to be made, and \nthat some things may not get done at all. \nAt the end of the day, in order to feel good about \nwhat you didn't get done, you must have made some c onscious \ndecisions about your responsibilities, goals, and v alues. That \nprocess invariably includes an often complex interp lay with the \ngoals, values, and directions of your organization and of the other \nsignificant people in your life, and with the impor tance of those \nrelationships to you. \n195 It is impossible to \nfeel good about\nyour choices unless \nyou are clear about\nwhat your work \nreally is.\n196 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY |  PART TWO \nThe Threefold Model for \nEvaluating Daily Work \nSetting priorities assumes that some things will be  more important \nthan others, but important relative to what? In thi s context, the \nanswer is, to your work—that is, the job you have a ccepted from \nyourself and/or from others. This is where the next  two frameworks \nneed to be brought to bear in your thinking. They'r e about defining \nyour work. Keep in mind that though much of this me thodology \nwill be within the arena of your professional focus , I'm using \"work\" \nin the universal sense, to mean anything you have a  commitment to \nmaking happen, personally as well as professionally . \nThese days, daily work activity itself presents a r elatively new \ntype of challenge to most professionals, something that it's help- \nful to understand as we endeavor to build the most productive \nsystems. As I explained earlier, during the course of the workday, \nat any point in time, you'll be engaged in one of t hree types of \nactivities: \n• Doing predefined work \n• Doing work as it shows up \n• Defining your work \nYou may be doing things on your action lists, doing  things as \nthey come up, or processing incoming inputs to dete rmine what \nwork that needs to be done, either then or later, f rom your lists. \n",

It \nsprings from their experience of having more on the ir \nplate to do than they can comfortably handle. They \nknow that some hard choices have to be made, and \nthat some things may not get done at all. \nAt the end of the day, in order to feel good about \nwhat you didn't get done, you must have made some c onscious \ndecisions about your responsibilities, goals, and v alues. That \nprocess invariably includes an often complex interp lay with the \ngoals, values, and directions of your organization and of the other \nsignificant people in your life, and with the impor tance of those \nrelationships to you. \n195 It is impossible to \nfeel good about\nyour choices unless \nyou are clear about\nwhat your work \nreally is.\n196 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY |  PART TWO \nThe Threefold Model for \nEvaluating Daily Work \nSetting priorities assumes that some things will be  more important \nthan others, but important relative to what?

    "text": "This is common sense. But many people let themselve s get \nwrapped around the second activity—dealing with thi ngs that \nshow up ad hoc—much too easily, and let the other t wo slide, to \ntheir detriment. \nLet's say it's 10:26 A.M. Monday, and you're in your office. \nYou've just ended a half-hour unexpected phone call  with a \nprospective client. You have three pages of scribbl ed notes from \nthe conversation. There's a meeting scheduled with your staff at \nCHAPTER 9  |  DOING: MAKING THE BEST ACTION CHOICES \neleven, about half an hour from now. You were out l ate last night \nwith your spouse's parents and are still a little f rayed around the \nedges (you told your father-in-law you'd get back t o him about. . . \nwhat?). Your assistant just laid six telephone mess ages in front of \nyou. You have a major strategic-planning session co ming up in \ntwo days, for which you have yet to formulate your ideas. The oil \nlight in your car came on as you drove to work this  morning. And \nyour boss hinted as you passed her earlier in the h all that she'd like \nyour thoughts on the memo she e-mailed you yesterda y, before \nthis afternoon's three o'clock meeting. \nAre your systems set up to maximally support \ndealing with this reality, at 10:26 on Monday morn-\ning? If you're still keeping things in your head, a nd if \nyou're still trying to capture only the \"critical\" stuff on \nyour lists, I suggest that the answer is no. \nI've noticed that people are actually more com- \nfortable dealing with surprises and crises than the y \nare taking control of processing, organizing, revie w- \ning, and assessing that part of their work that is not as \nself-evident. It's easy to get sucked into \"busy\" a nd \n\"urgent\" mode, especially when you have a lot of un processed and \nrelatively out-of-control work on your desk, in you r e-mail, and \non your mind. \nIn fact, much of our life and work just shows up in  the \nmoment, and it usually becomes the priority when it  does. It's \nindeed true for most professionals that the nature of their job \nrequires them to be instantly available to handle n ew work as \nit appears in many forms. For instance, you need to  pay atten- \ntion to your boss when he shows up and wants a few minutes \nof your time. You get a request from a senior execu tive that sud- \ndenly takes precedence over anything else you thoug ht you \nneeded to do today. You find out about a serious pr oblem with ful- \nfilling a major customer's order, and you have to t ake care of it \nright away. \nThese are all understandable judgment calls. But th e angst \n197 It is often easier to \nget wrapped up in \nthe urgent demands \nof the moment than \nto deal with your in- \nbasket, e-mail, and \nthe rest of your \nopen loops.\n198 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  |  PART TWO \nbegins to mount when the other actions on your list s are not \nreviewed and renegotiated by you or between you and  everyone \nelse. The constant sacrifices of not doing the work  you have \ndefined on your lists can be tolerated only if you know what you're \nnot doing. That requires regular processing of your  in-basket \n(defining your work) and consistent review of compl ete lists of all \nyour predetermined work. \nIf choosing to do work that just showed up instead of doing \nwork you predefined is a conscious choice, based on  your best call, \nthat's playing the game the best way you can. Most people, how- \never, have major improvements to make in how they c larify, man- \nage, and renegotiate their total inventory of proje cts and actions. If \nyou let yourself get caught up in the urgencies of the moment, \nwithout feeling comfortable about what you're not dealing with, \nthe result is frustration and anxiety. Too often th e stress and \nlowered effectiveness are blamed on the \"surprises. \" If you know \nwhat you're doing, and what you're not doing, surprises are just \nanother opportunity to be creative and excel. \nIn addition, when the in-basket and the action list s get \nignored for too long, random things lying in them t end to surface \nas emergencies later on, adding more ad hoc work-as -it-shows-up \nto fuel the fire. \nMany people use the inevitablity of an almost infin ite",

But many people let themselve s get \nwrapped around the second activity—dealing with thi ngs that \nshow up ad hoc—much too easily, and let the other t wo slide, to \ntheir detriment. \nLet's say it's 10:26 A.M. Monday, and you're in your office. \nYou've just ended a half-hour unexpected phone call  with a \nprospective client. You have three pages of scribbl ed notes from \nthe conversation. There's a meeting scheduled with your staff at \nCHAPTER 9  |  DOING: MAKING THE BEST ACTION CHOICES \neleven, about half an hour from now.

If you're still keeping things in your head, a nd if \nyou're still trying to capture only the \"critical\" stuff on \nyour lists, I suggest that the answer is no. \nI've noticed that people are actually more com- \nfortable dealing with surprises and crises than the y \nare taking control of processing, organizing, revie w- \ning, and assessing that part of their work that is not as \nself-evident. It's easy to get sucked into \"busy\" a nd \n\"urgent\" mode, especially when you have a lot of un processed and \nrelatively out-of-control work on your desk, in you r e-mail, and \non your mind. \nIn fact, much of our life and work just shows up in  the \nmoment, and it usually becomes the priority when it  does.

It's \nindeed true for most professionals that the nature of their job \nrequires them to be instantly available to handle n ew work as \nit appears in many forms. For instance, you need to  pay atten- \ntion to your boss when he shows up and wants a few minutes \nof your time. You get a request from a senior execu tive that sud- \ndenly takes precedence over anything else you thoug ht you \nneeded to do today.

Most people, how- \never, have major improvements to make in how they c larify, man- \nage, and renegotiate their total inventory of proje cts and actions. If \nyou let yourself get caught up in the urgencies of the moment, \nwithout feeling comfortable about what you're not dealing with, \nthe result is frustration and anxiety.

    "text": " long, random things lying in them t end to surface \nas emergencies later on, adding more ad hoc work-as -it-shows-up \nto fuel the fire. \nMany people use the inevitablity of an almost infin ite stream \nof immediately evident things to do as a way to avo id the respon- \nsibilities of defining their work and managing thei r total inven- \ntory. It's easy to get seduced into not-quite-so-cr itical stuff that is \nright at hand, especially if your in-basket and you r personal orga- \nnization are out of control. Too often \"managing by  wandering \naround\" is an excuse for getting away from amorphou s piles of \nstuff. \nThis is where the need for knowledge-work athletics  really \nshows up. Most people did not grow up in a world wh ere defining \nthe edges of work and managing huge numbers of open  loops were \nrequired. But when you've developed the skill and, habits of pro- \ncessing input rapidly into a rigorously defined sys tem, it becomes \nCHAPTER 9  I  DOING: MAKING THE BEST ACTION CHOICES \nmuch easier to trust your judgment calls about the dance of what \nto do, what to stop doing, and what to do instead. \nThe Moment-to-Moment Balancing Act \nAt the black-belt level, you can shift like lightni ng from one foot \nto the other and back again. While you're processin g your in- \nbasket, for example, your assistant comes in to tel l \nyou about a situation that needs immediate atten- \ntion. No sweat—your tray is still there, with every - \nthing still to be processed in one stack, ready to be \npicked up again when you can get back to it. While \nyou're on hold on the phone, you can be reviewing \nyour action lists and getting a sense of what you'r e \ngoing to do when the call is done. While you wait f or \na meeting to start, you can work down the \"Read/ \nReview\" stack you've brought with you. And when \nthe conversation you weren't expecting with your \nboss shrinks the time you have before your next \nmeeting to twelve minutes, you can easily find a wa y \nto use that window to good advantage. \nYou can do only one of these work activities at a t ime. If you \nstop to talk to someone in his or her office, you'r e not working off \nyour lists or processing incoming stuff. The challe nge is to feel \nconfident about what you have decided to do. \nSo how do you decide? This again will involve your intuitive \njudgments—how important is the unexpected work, aga inst all \nthe rest? How long can you let your in-basket go un processed and \nall your stuff unreviewed and trust that you're mak ing good deci- \nsions about what to do? \nPeople often complain about the interruptions that prevent \nthem from doing their work. But interruptions are u navoidable in \nlife. When you become elegant at dispatching what's  coming in \nand are organized enough to take advantage of the \" weird time\" \nwindows that show up, you can switch between one ta sk and the \nother rapidly. You can be processing e-mails while you're on hold \n199 To ignore the \nunexpected (even if \nit were possible) \nwould be to live \nwithout \nopportunity, \nspontaneity, and \nthe rich moments \nof which \"life\" is \nmade. \n—Stephen Covey",

It's easy to get seduced into not-quite-so-cr itical stuff that is \nright at hand, especially if your in-basket and you r personal orga- \nnization are out of control. Too often \"managing by  wandering \naround\" is an excuse for getting away from amorphou s piles of \nstuff. \nThis is where the need for knowledge-work athletics  really \nshows up.

While you wait f or \na meeting to start, you can work down the \"Read/ \nReview\" stack you've brought with you.

If you \nstop to talk to someone in his or her office, you'r e not working off \nyour lists or processing incoming stuff. The challe nge is to feel \nconfident about what you have decided to do. \nSo how do you decide? This again will involve your intuitive \njudgments—how important is the unexpected work, aga inst all \nthe rest? How long can you let your in-basket go un processed and \nall your stuff unreviewed and trust that you're mak ing good deci- \nsions about what to do? \nPeople often complain about the interruptions that prevent \nthem from doing their work. But interruptions are u navoidable in \nlife. When you become elegant at dispatching what's  coming in \nand are organized enough to take advantage of the \" weird time\" \nwindows that show up, you can switch between one ta sk and the \nother rapidly. You can be processing e-mails while you're on hold \n199 To ignore the \nunexpected (even if \nit were possible) \nwould be to live \nwithout \nopportunity, \nspontaneity, and \nthe rich moments \nof which \"life\" is \nmade. \n—Stephen Covey",
