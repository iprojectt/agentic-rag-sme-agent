    "text": "Getting Started: Setting Up \nthe Time, Space, and Tools \nIN PART 2 we'll move from a conceptual framework and limite d \napplication of workflow mastery to full-scale imple mentation and \nbest practices. Going through this program often gi ves people a \nlevel of relaxed control they may never have experi enced before, \nbut it usually requires the catalyst of step-by-ste p procedures to \nget there. To that end, I'll provide a logical sequ ence of things to \ndo, to make it as easy as possible for you to get o n board and glean \nthe most value from these techniques. \nImplementation—Whether Ail-Out or \nCasual—Is a Lot About \"Tricks\" \nIf you're not sure you're committed to an all-out i mplementation \nof these methods, let me assure you that a lot of t he value people \nget from this material is good \"tricks.\" Sometimes \njust one good trick can make it worthwhile to range\nthrough this information: I've had people tell me, for \nexample, that the best thing they got from my two- \nday seminar was advice on setting up and using a \ntickler file. Tricks are for the not-so-smart, not- so- \nconscious part of us. To a great degree, the highes t- \nperforming people I know are those who have \ninstalled the best tricks in their lives. I know th at's \n85 It is easier to act \nyourself into a \nbetter way of \nfeeling than to feel \nyourself into a \nbetter way of \naction. \n—0. H. Mowrer \nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  I  PART TWO \ntrue of me. The smart part of us sets up things for  us to do that the \nnot-so-smart part responds to almost automatically,  creating \nbehavior that produces high-performance results. We  trick our- \nselves into doing what we ought to be doing. \nFor instance, if you're a semiregular exerciser lik e me, you \nprobably have your own little tricks to get you to exercise. My best \ntrick is costume —the clothing I put on or take off. If I put on exe r- \ncise gear, I'll start to feel like exercising; if I  don't, I'm very likely \nto feel like doing something else. \nLet's look at an example of a real productivity tri ck. You've \nprobably taken work home that you had to bring back the next \nday, right? It was mission-critical that you not fo rget it the next \nmorning. So where did you put it the night before? Did you put it \nin front of the door, or on your keys, so you'd be sure to take it \nwith you? For this you got a higher education? What  a sophisti- \ncated piece of self-management technology you've in stalled in \nyour life! But actually that's just what it is. The  smart part of you \nthe night before knows that the not-so-smart part o f you first \nthing in the morning may barely be conscious. \"What 's this in \nfront of the door!? Oh, that's right, I've got to t ake this with me!\" \nWhat a class act. But really, it is. It's a trick I  call Put It in \nFront of the Door. For our purposes the \"door\" is g oing to be the \ndoor of your mind, not your house. But it's the sam e idea. \nIf you were to take out your calendar right now and  look \nclosely at every single item for the next fourteen \ndays, you'd probably come up with at least one \"Oh- \nthat-reminds-me-I-need-to_____________ .\" If you \nthen cap- \ntured that value-added thought into some place that\nwould trigger you to act, you'd feel better already , \nhave a clearer head, and get more positive things \ndone. It's not rocket science, just a good trick. \nIf you take out a clean sheet of paper right now, \nalong with your favorite writing instrument, and fo r \nthree minutes focus solely on the most awesome proj - \nect on your mind, I guarantee you'll have at least one \n86 You increase \nyour productivity \nand creativity \nexponentially when \nyou think about the \nright things at the \nright time and have \nthe tools to capture \nyour value-added \nthinking. \nCHAPTER 4 |  GETTING STARTED: SETTING UP THE TIME, SPACE, AND  TOOLS \n\"Oh, yeah, I need to consider __.\" Then capture what  shows up \nin your head on the piece of paper and put it where  you might \nactually use the idea or information. You won't be one ounce",

If I put on exe r- \ncise gear, I'll start to feel like exercising; if I  don't, I'm very likely \nto feel like doing something else. \nLet's look at an example of a real productivity tri ck. You've \nprobably taken work home that you had to bring back the next \nday, right? It was mission-critical that you not fo rget it the next \nmorning. So where did you put it the night before? Did you put it \nin front of the door, or on your keys, so you'd be sure to take it \nwith you? For this you got a higher education? What  a sophisti- \ncated piece of self-management technology you've in stalled in \nyour life! But actually that's just what it is. The  smart part of you \nthe night before knows that the not-so-smart part o f you first \nthing in the morning may barely be conscious. \"What 's this in \nfront of the door!? Oh, that's right, I've got to t ake this with me!\" \nWhat a class act. But really, it is. It's a trick I  call Put It in \nFront of the Door. For our purposes the \"door\" is g oing to be the \ndoor of your mind, not your house. But it's the sam e idea. \nIf you were to take out your calendar right now and  look \nclosely at every single item for the next fourteen \ndays, you'd probably come up with at least one \"Oh- \nthat-reminds-me-I-need-to_____________ .\" If you \nthen cap- \ntured that value-added thought into some place that\nwould trigger you to act, you'd feel better already , \nhave a clearer head, and get more positive things \ndone. It's not rocket science, just a good trick. \nIf you take out a clean sheet of paper right now, \nalong with your favorite writing instrument, and fo r \nthree minutes focus solely on the most awesome proj - \nect on your mind, I guarantee you'll have at least one \n86 You increase \nyour productivity \nand creativity \nexponentially when \nyou think about the \nright things at the \nright time and have \nthe tools to capture \nyour value-added \nthinking. \nCHAPTER 4 |  GETTING STARTED: SETTING UP THE TIME, SPACE, AND",

If I put on exe r- \ncise gear, I'll start to feel like exercising; if I  don't, I'm very likely \nto feel like doing something else. \nLet's look at an example of a real productivity tri ck. You've \nprobably taken work home that you had to bring back the next \nday, right? It was mission-critical that you not fo rget it the next \nmorning. So where did you put it the night before? Did you put it \nin front of the door, or on your keys, so you'd be sure to take it \nwith you? For this you got a higher education? What  a sophisti- \ncated piece of self-management technology you've in stalled in \nyour life! But actually that's just what it is. The  smart part of you \nthe night before knows that the not-so-smart part o f you first \nthing in the morning may barely be conscious. \"What 's this in \nfront of the door!? Oh, that's right, I've got to t ake this with me!\" \nWhat a class act. But really, it is. It's a trick I  call Put It in \nFront",

For our purposes the \"door\" is g oing to be the \ndoor of your mind, not your house. But it's the sam e idea. \nIf you were to take out your calendar right now and  look \nclosely at every single item for the next fourteen \ndays, you'd probably come up with at least one \"Oh- \nthat-reminds-me-I-need-to_____________ .\" If you \nthen cap- \ntured that value-added thought into some place that\nwould trigger you to act, you'd feel better already , \nhave a clearer head, and get more positive things \ndone. It's not rocket science, just a good trick. \nIf you take out a clean sheet of paper right now, \nalong with your favorite writing instrument, and fo r \nthree minutes focus solely on the most awesome proj - \nect on your mind, I guarantee you'll have at least one \n86 You increase \nyour productivity \nand creativity \nex",

    "text": "  TOOLS \n\"Oh, yeah, I need to consider __.\" Then capture what  shows up \nin your head on the piece of paper and put it where  you might \nactually use the idea or information. You won't be one ounce \nsmarter than you were ten minutes ago, but you'll h ave added \nvalue to your work and life. \nMuch of learning how to manage workflow in a \"black  belt\" \nway is about laying out the gear and practicing the  moves so that \nthe requisite thinking happens more automatically a nd it's a lot \neasier to get engaged in the game. The suggestions that follow \nabout getting time, space, and tools in place are a ll trusted meth- \nods for making things happen at a terrific new leve l. \nIf you're sincere about making a major leap forward  in your \npersonal management systems, I recommend that you p ay close \nattention to the details and follow through on the suggestions \nprovided below in their entirety. The whole will be  greater than \nthe sum of the parts. You'll also discover that the  execution of this \nprogram will produce real progress on real things t hat are going \non in your life right now. We'll get lots done that  you want to get \ndone, in new and efficient ways that may amaze you.\nSetting Aside the Time \nI recommend that you create a block of time to init ialize this \nprocess and prepare a workstation with the appropri ate space, fur- \nniture, and tools. If your space is properly set up  and streamlined, \nit can reduce your unconscious resistance to dealin g with your \nstuff and even make it attractive for you to sit down and crank \nthrough your input and your work. An ideal time fra me for most \npeople is two whole days, back to back. (Don't be p ut off by that if \nyou don't have that long to spend, though: doing an y of the activi- \nties I suggest will be useful, no matter how much o r how little \ntime you devote to them. Two days are not required to benefit \nfrom these techniques and principles—they will star t to pay off \nalmost instantly.) Implementing the full collection  process can \n87 \nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  I  PART TWO \ntake up to six hours or more, and processing and de ciding on \nactions for all the input you'll want to externaliz e and capture into \nyour system can easily take another eight hours. Of  course you \ncan also collect and process your stuff in chunks, but it'll be much \neasier if you can tackle that front-end portion in one fell swoop. \nThe ideal time for me to work with a professional i s on a \nweekend or holiday because the chance of outside di sturbance is \nminimal then. If I work with someone on a typical w orkday, we \nfirst make sure that no meetings are scheduled and only emer- \ngency interruptions are allowed; phone calls are ro uted to voice- \nmail, or logged by secretaries for review and handl ing during a \nbreak. I don't recommend using \"after hours\" for th is work. It usu- \nally means seriously reduced horsepower and a big t endency to \nget caught up in \"rabbit trails.\" * \nFor many of the executives I work with, holding the  world back \nfor two contiguous days is the hardest part of the whole process—\nthe perceived necessity to be constantly available for meetings and \ncommunications when they're \"at work\" is difficult for them to let go \nof. That's why we often resort to weekends. If you work in an open \ncubicle or office, it will be even more of a challe nge to isolate suffi- \ncient time blocks on a regular workday during offic e hours. \nIt's not that the procedure itself is so \"sacred\"; it's just that it \ntakes a lot of psychic energy to collect and proces s \nsuch a large inventory of open loops, especially wh en \nthey've been \"open,\" \"undecided,\" or \"stuck\" for wa y \ntoo long. Interruptions can double the time it take s \nto get through everything. If you can get to ground\nzero in one contained time period, it gives you a h uge \nsense of control and accomplishment and frees up a \nreservoir of energy and creativity. Later on you ca n \n88 *After hours is actually a good time to crank throu gh a group of similar tasks \nthat you wouldn't normally do in the course of your  typical workday, like \nfiling \na big backlog of papers, organizing photographs, su rfing the Web about your \nupcoming vacation location, or processing expense r eceipts. Dedicate two days \nto this process, and \nit will be worth \n",

If your space is properly set up  and streamlined, \nit can reduce your unconscious resistance to dealin g with your \nstuff and even make it attractive for you to sit down and crank \nthrough your input and your work.

Of  course you \ncan also collect and process your stuff in chunks, but it'll be much \neasier if you can tackle that front-end portion in one fell swoop. \nThe ideal time for me to work with a professional i s on a \nweekend or holiday because the chance of outside di sturbance is \nminimal then. If I work with someone on a typical w orkday, we \nfirst make sure that no meetings are scheduled and only emer- \ngency interruptions are allowed; phone calls are ro uted to voice- \nmail, or logged by secretaries for review and handl ing during a \nbreak.

That's why we often resort to weekends. If you work in an open \ncubicle or office, it will be even more of a challe nge to isolate suffi- \ncient time blocks on a regular workday during offic e hours. \nIt's not that the procedure itself is so \"sacred\"; it's just that it \ntakes a lot of psychic energy to collect and proces s \nsuch a large inventory of open loops, especially wh en \nthey've been \"open,\" \"undecided,\" or \"stuck\" for wa y \ntoo long. Interruptions can double the time it take s \nto get through everything. If you can get to ground\nzero in one contained time period, it gives you a h uge \nsense of control and accomplishment and frees up a \nreservoir of energy and creativity.

If I work with someone on a typical w orkday, we \nfirst make sure that no meetings are scheduled and only emer- \ngency interruptions are allowed; phone calls are ro uted to voice- \nmail, or logged by secretaries for review and handl ing during a \nbreak. I don't recommend using \"after hours\" for th is work.

Dedicate two days \nto this process, and \nit will be worth \nmany times that in \nterms of your \nproductivity and \nmental health. \nCHAPTER 4  |  GETTING STARTED: SETTING UP THE TIME, SPACE, AND  TOOLS \nmaintain your system in shorter spurts around and \" between the \nlines\" of you regular day. \nSetting Up the Space \nYou'll need a physical location to serve as a centr al cockpit of con- \ntrol. If you already have a desk and office space s et up where you \nwork, that's probably the best place to start. If y ou work from a \nhome office, obviously that will be your prime location. If you \nalready have both, you'll want to establish identic al, even inter- \nchangeable systems in both places. \nThe basics for a work space are just a writing surf ace and \nroom for an in-basket. Some people, such as a forem an in a \nmachine shop, an intake nurse on a hospital floor, or your chil- \ndren's nanny, won't need much more than that. The w riting sur- \nface will of course expand for most professionals, to include a \nphone, a computer, stacking trays, working file dra wers, reference \nshelves. Some may feel the need for a fax, a printe r, a VCR, and/ \nor multimedia conferencing equipment. The seriously  self- \ncontained will also want gear for exercise, leisure , and hobbies. \nA functional work space is critical. If you don't a lready have a \ndedicated work space and in-basket, get them now. T hat goes for \nstudents, homemakers, and retirees, too. Everyone m ust have a \nphysical locus of control from which to deal with e verything else. \nIf I had to set up an emergency workstation in just  a few \nminutes, I would buy a door, put it on top of two t wo-drawer fil- \ning cabinets (one at each end), place three stack-b askets on it, and \nadd a legal pad and pen. That would be my home base  (if I had \ntime to sit down, I'd also buy a stool!). Believe i t or not, I've been \nin several executive offices that wouldn't be as fu nctional. \nIf You Go to an Office, You'll Still Need a Space a t Home \nDon't skimp on work space at home. As you'll discov er through \nthis process, it's critical that you have at least a satellite home \n89 \nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  |  PART TWO \nsystem identical to the one in your office. Many pe o- \nple I've worked with have been somewhat embar- \nrassed by the degree of chaos that reigns in their \nhomes, in contrast to their offices at work; they'v e \ngotten tremendous value from giving themselves \npermission to establish the same setup in both plac es. \nIf you're like many of them, you'll find that a wee k- \nend spent setting up a home workstation can make a revolution- \nary change in your ability to organize your life. \nAn Office Space in Transit \nIf you move around much, as a business traveler or jus t as a person \nwith a mobile life-style, you'll also want to set u p an efficiently \norganized micro-office-in-transit. More than likely  this will con- \nsist of a briefcase, pack, or satchel with appropri ate folders and \nportable workstation supplies. \nMany people lose opportunities to be productive bec ause \nthey're not equipped to take advantage of the odd m oments and \nwindows of time that open up as they move from one place to \nanother, or when they're in off-site environments. The combina- \ntion of a good processing style, the right tools, a nd good intercon- \nnected systems at home and at work can make traveli ng a highly \nleveraged way to get certain kinds of work done. \nDon't Share Space! \nIt is imperative that you have your own work space—or at least your \nown in-basket and a physical place in which to proc ess paper. Too \nmany married couples I've worked with have tried to  work out of a \nsingle desk at home, and it always makes light-year s of difference \nwhen they expand to two workstations. Far from bein g the \"separa- \ntion\" they expect, the move in fact relieves them o f a subtle stress in \ntheir relationship about managing the stuff of thei r shared lives. \nOne couple even decided",

Dedicate two days \nto this process, and \nit will be worth \nmany times that in \nterms of your \nproductivity and \nmental health. \nCHAPTER 4  |  GETTING STARTED: SETTING UP THE TIME, SPACE, AND  TOOLS \nmaintain your system in shorter spurts around and \" between the \nlines\" of you regular day. \nSetting Up the Space \nYou'll need a physical location to serve as a centr al cockpit of con- \ntrol. If you already have a desk and office space s et up where you \nwork, that's probably the best place to start. If y ou work from a \nhome office, obviously that will be your prime location. If you \nalready have both, you'll want to establish identic al, even inter- \nchangeable systems in both places. \nThe basics for a work space are just a writing surf ace and \nroom for an in-basket. Some people, such as a forem an in a \nmachine shop, an intake nurse on a hospital floor, or your chil- \ndren's nanny, won't need much more than that. The w riting sur- \nface will of course expand for most professionals, to include a \nphone, a computer, stacking trays, working file dra wers, reference \nshelves. Some may feel the need for a fax, a printe r, a VCR, and/ \nor multimedia conferencing equipment. The seriously  self- \ncontained will also want gear for exercise, leisure , and hobbies. \nA functional work space is critical. If you don't a lready have a \ndedicated work space and in-basket, get them now. T hat goes for \nstudents, homemakers, and retirees, too. Everyone m ust have a \nphysical locus of control from which to deal with e verything else. \nIf I had to set up an emergency workstation in just  a few \nminutes, I would buy a door, put it on top of two t wo-drawer fil- \ning cabinets (one at each end), place three stack-b askets on it, and \nadd a legal pad and pen. That would be my home base  (if I had \ntime to sit down, I'd also buy a stool!). Believe i t",

    "text": "stations. Far from bein g the \"separa- \ntion\" they expect, the move in fact relieves them o f a subtle stress in \ntheir relationship about managing the stuff of thei r shared lives. \nOne couple even decided to set up an additional min i-workstation \nin the kitchen for the stay-at-home mom, so she cou ld process \nwork while keeping an eye on their infant in the fa mily room. \n90 You must have a \nfocused work \nspace—at home, \nat \nwork, and if \npossible even in \nCHAPTER 4  |  GETTING STARTED: SETTING UP THE TIME, SPACE, AND  TOOLS \nSome organizations are interested in the concept of  \"hotel- \ning\"—that is, having people create totally self-con tained and \nmobile workstation capabilities so they can \"plug i n\" anywhere in \nthe company, at any time, and work from there. I ha ve my doubts \nabout how well that concept will work in practice. A friend who \nwas involved in setting up an \"office of the future \" model in Wash- \nington, D.C., for the U.S. government, claimed that  hoteling \ntended to fall apart because of the \"Mine!\" factor— people wanted \ntheir own stuff. I suggest there's a deeper reason for the fa ilure: there \nneeds to be zero resistance at the less-than-consci ous level for us to \nuse the systems we have. Having to continually reinvent  our in- \nbasket, our filing system, and how and where we pro cess our stuff \ncan only be a source of incessant distraction. \nYou can work virtually everywhere if you have a \nclean, compact system and know how to process your \nstuff rapidly and portably. But you'll still need a\n\"home base\" with a well-grooved set of tools and \nsufficient space for all the reference and support \nmaterial that you'll want somewhere close at hand \nwhen you \"land.\" Most people I work with need at \nleast four file drawers for their general-reference  and project- \nsupport types of paper-based materials—and it's har d to imagine \nthat all of that could ever be totally and easily m ovable. \nGetting the Tools You'll Need \nIf you're committed to a full implementation of thi s workflow \nprocess, there are some basic supplies and equipmen t that you'll \nneed to get you started. As you go along, you're li kely to dance \nbetween using what you're used to and evaluating th e possibilities \nfor new and different gear to work with. \nNote that good tools don't necessarily have to be e xpensive. \nOften, on the low-tech side, the more \"executive\" s omething \nlooks, the more dysfunctional it really is. \n91 It is critical that you \nhave your own \nwork space. You \nwant to use your \nsystems, not just\nthink about them.\n92 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY |  PART TWO \nThe Basic Processing Tools \nLet's assume you're starting from scratch. In addit ion to a desktop \nwork space, you'll need: \n• Paper-holding trays (at least three) \n• A stack of plain letter-size paper \n• A pen/pencil \n•Post-its (3X3s) \n• Paper clips \n• Binder clips \n• A stapler and staples \n• Scotch tape \n• Rubber bands \n• An automatic labeler \n• File folders \n• A calendar \n• Wastebasket/recycling bins \nPaper-Holding Trays \nThese will serve as your in-basket and out-basket, with one or \ntwo others for work-in-progress support papers and/ or your \"read \nand review\" stack. The most functional trays are th e side-facing \nletter or legal stackable kinds, which have no \"lip \" on them to \nkeep you from sliding out a single piece of paper. \nPlain Paper \nYou'll use plain paper for the initial collection p rocess. Believe it \nor not, putting one thought on one full-size sheet of paper can \nhave enormous value. Although most people will wind  up pro- \ncessing their notes into some sort of list organize r, a few will actu- \nally stick with the simple piece-of-paper-per-thoug ht system. In \nany case, it's important to have plenty of letter-s ize writing paper \nor tablets around to make capturing ad hoc input ea sy. \nCHAPTER 4  |  GETTING STARTED: SETTING UP THE TIME, SPACE, AND  TOOLS \nPost-its, Clips, Stapler, Etc. \nPost-its, clips, stapler, tape, and rubber bands wi ll \ncome in handy for routing and storing paper-based \nmaterials. We're not finished with paper yet (if yo u \nhaven't noticed!), and",

    "text": "stations. Far from bein g the \"separa- \ntion\" they expect, the move in fact relieves them o f a subtle stress in \ntheir relationship about managing the stuff of thei r shared lives. \nOne couple even decided to set up an additional min i-workstation \nin the kitchen for the stay-at-home mom, so she cou ld process \nwork while keeping an eye on their infant in the fa mily room. \n90 You must have a \nfocused work \nspace—at home, \nat \nwork, and if \npossible even in \nCHAPTER 4  |  GETTING STARTED: SETTING UP THE TIME, SPACE, AND  TOOLS \nSome organizations are interested in the concept of  \"hotel- \ning\"—that is, having people create totally self-con tained and \nmobile workstation capabilities so they can \"plug i n\" anywhere in \nthe company, at any time, and work from there. I ha ve my doubts \nabout how well that concept will work in practice. A friend who \nwas involved in setting up an \"office of the future \" model in Wash- \nington, D.C., for the U.S. government, claimed that  hoteling \ntended to fall apart because of the \"Mine!\" factor— people wanted \ntheir own stuff. I suggest there's a deeper reason for the fa ilure: there \nneeds to be zero resistance at the less-than-consci ous level for us to \nuse the systems we have. Having to continually reinvent  our in- \nbasket, our filing system, and how and where we pro cess our stuff \ncan only be a source of incessant distraction. \nYou can work virtually everywhere if you have a \nclean, compact system and know how to process your \nstuff rapidly and portably. But you'll still need a\n\"home base\" with a well-grooved set of tools and \nsufficient space for all the reference and support \nmaterial that you'll want somewhere close at hand \nwhen you \"land.\" Most people I work with need at \nleast four file drawers for their general-reference  and project- \nsupport types of paper-based materials—and it's har d to imagine \nthat all of that could ever be totally and easily m ovable. \nGetting the Tools You'll Need \nIf you're committed to a full implementation of thi s workflow \nprocess, there are some basic supplies and equipmen t that you'll \nneed to get you started.

As you go along, you're li kely to dance \nbetween using what you're used to and evaluating th e possibilities \nfor new and different gear to work with. \nNote that good tools don't necessarily have to be e xpensive. \nOften, on the low-tech side, the more \"executive\" s omething \nlooks, the more dysfunctional it really is. \n91 It is critical that you \nhave your own \nwork space. You \nwant to use your \nsystems, not just\nthink about them.\n92 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY |  PART TWO \nThe Basic Processing Tools \nLet's assume you're starting from scratch. In addit ion to a desktop \nwork space, you'll need: \n• Paper-holding trays (at least three) \n• A stack of plain letter-size paper \n• A pen/pencil \n•Post-its (3X3s) \n• Paper clips \n• Binder clips \n• A stapler and staples \n• Scotch tape \n• Rubber bands \n• An automatic labeler \n• File folders \n• A calendar \n• Wastebasket/recycling bins \nPaper-Holding Trays \nThese will serve as your in-basket and out-basket, with one or \ntwo others for work-in-progress support papers and/ or your \"read \nand review\" stack. The most functional trays are th e side-facing \nletter or legal stackable kinds, which have no \"lip \" on them to \nkeep you from sliding out a single piece of paper. \nPlain Paper \nYou'll use plain paper for the initial collection p rocess. Believe it \nor not, putting one thought on one full-size sheet of paper can \nhave enormous value. Although most people will wind  up pro- \ncessing their notes into some sort of list organize r, a few will actu- \nally stick with the simple piece-of-paper-per-thoug ht system. In \nany case, it's important to have plenty of letter-s ize writing paper \nor tablets around to make capturing ad hoc input ea sy. \nCHAPTER 4  |  GETTING STARTED: SETTING UP THE TIME, SPACE, AND  TOOLS \nPost-its, Clips, Stapler,",

As you go along, you're li kely to dance \nbetween using what you're used to and evaluating th e possibilities \nfor new and different gear to work with. \nNote that good tools don't necessarily have to be e xpensive. \nOften, on the low-tech side, the more \"executive\" s omething \nlooks, the more dysfunctional it really is. \n91 It is critical that you \nhave your own \nwork space. You \nwant to use your \nsystems, not just\nthink about them.\n92 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY |  PART TWO \nThe Basic Processing Tools \nLet's assume you're starting from scratch. In addit ion to a desktop \nwork space, you'll need: \n• Paper-holding trays (at least three) \n• A stack of plain letter-size paper \n• A pen/pencil \n•Post-its (3X3s) \n• Paper clips \n• Binder clips \n• A stapler and staples \n",

    "text": " Etc. \nPost-its, clips, stapler, tape, and rubber bands wi ll \ncome in handy for routing and storing paper-based \nmaterials. We're not finished with paper yet (if yo u \nhaven't noticed!), and the simple tools for managin g \nit are essential. \nThe Labeler \nThe labeler is a surprisingly critical tool in our work. \nThousands of executives and professionals and homem akers I \nhave worked with now have their own automatic label ers, and my \narchives are full of their comments, like, \"Incredi ble—I wouldn't \nhave believed what a difference it makes!\" The labe ler will be used \nto label your file folders, binder spines, and nume rous other \nthings. \nAt this writing, I recommend the Brother labeler—it 's the \nmost user-friendly. Get the least expensive one tha t sits on a desk \nand has an AC adapter (so you won't have to worry a bout batter- \nies). Also get a large supply of cassettes of label  tape—black letters \non white tape (instead of clear) are much easier to  read and allow \nyou to relabel folders you might want to reuse. \nYou can get software and printer sheets to make com puter- \ngenerated labels, but I prefer the stand-alone tool . If you have to \nwait to do your filing or labeling as a batch job, you'll most likely \nresist making files for single pieces of paper, and  it'll add the for- \nmality factor, which really puts the brakes on this  system. \nFile Folders \nYou'll need plenty of file folders (get letter size  if you can, legal \nsize if you must). You may also need an equal numbe r of \nPendaflex-style file-folder hangers, if your filing  system requires \nthem. Plain manila folders are fine—color-coding is  a level of \ncomplexity that's hardly ever worth the effort. You r general- \nreference filing system should just be a simple lib rary. \n93 Moment-to-moment\ncollecting, thinking,\nprocessing, and \norganizing are \nchallenging enough;\nalways ensure that\nyou have the tools \nto make them as \neasy as possible.\n94 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  I  PART TWO \nCalendar \nAlthough you may not need a calendar just to collec t your incom- \nplete items, you'll certainly come up with actions that need to be \nput there, too. As I noted earlier, the calendar sh ould be used \nnot \nto hold action lists but to track the \"hard landsca pe\" of things \nthat \nhave to get done on a specific day or at a specific time . \nMost professionals these days already have some sor t of \nworking calendar system in place, ranging from pock et week-at- \na-glance booklets, to loose-leaf organizers with da y-, week-, \nmonth-, and year-at-a-glance options, to single-use r software \norganizers, to group-ware calendars used companywid e, like Out- \nlook or Lotus Notes. \nThe calendar has often been the central tool that p eople \nrely \non to \"get organized.\" It's certainly a critical co mponent in man- \naging particular kinds of data and reminders of the  commitments \nthat relate to specific times and days. There are m any reminders \nand some data that you will want a calendar for, bu t you won't be \nstopping there: your calendar will need to be integ rated with a \nmuch more comprehensive system that will emerge as you apply \nthis method. \nYou may wonder what kind of calendar would be best for you \nto use, and I'll discuss that in more detail in the  next chapter. For \nnow, just keep using the one you've got. After you develop a feel \nfor the whole systematic approach, you'll have a be tter reference \npoint for deciding about graduating to a different tool. \nWastebasket/Recycling Bins \nIf you're like most people, you're going to toss a lot more stuff \nthan you expect, so get ready to create a good bit of trash. Some \nexecutives I have coached have found it extremely u seful to \narrange for a large Dumpster to be parked immediate ly outside \ntheir offices the day we work together! \nCHAPTER 4  |  GETTING STARTED: SETTING UP THE TIME, SPACE, AND  TOOLS \nDo You Need an Organizer? \nWhether or not you'll need an organizer will depend  on a number \nof factors. Are you already committed to using one?  How do you \nwant to see your reminders of actions, agendas, and  projects? \nWhere and how often might you need to review them? Because \nyour head is",

Get the least expensive one tha t sits on a desk \nand has an AC adapter (so you won't have to worry a bout batter- \nies). Also get a large supply of cassettes of label  tape—black letters \non white tape (instead of clear) are much easier to  read and allow \nyou to relabel folders you might want to reuse. \nYou can get software and printer sheets to make com puter- \ngenerated labels, but I prefer the stand-alone tool . If you have to \nwait to do your filing or labeling as a batch job, you'll most likely \nresist making files for single pieces of paper, and  it'll add the for- \nmality factor, which really puts the brakes on this  system. \nFile Folders \nYou'll need plenty of file folders (get letter size  if you can, legal \nsize if you must). You may also need an equal numbe r of \nPendaflex-style file-folder hangers, if your filing  system requires \nthem. Plain manila folders are fine—color-coding is  a level of \ncomplexity that's hardly ever worth the effort.

We're not finished with paper yet (if yo u \nhaven't noticed!), and the simple tools for managin g \nit are essential. \nThe Labeler \nThe labeler is a surprisingly critical tool in our work. \nThousands of executives and professionals and homem akers I \nhave worked with now have their own automatic label ers, and my \narchives are full of their comments, like, \"Incredi ble—I wouldn't \nhave believed what a difference it makes!\" The labe ler will be used \nto label your file folders, binder spines, and nume rous other \nthings. \nAt this writing, I recommend the Brother labeler—it 's the \nmost user-friendly. Get the least expensive one tha t sits on a desk \nand has an AC adapter (so you won't have to worry a bout batter- \nies). Also get a large supply of cassettes of label  tape—black letters \non white tape (instead of clear) are much easier to  read and allow \nyou to relabel folders you might want to reuse. \n",

Also get a large supply of cassettes of label  tape—black letters \non white tape (instead of clear) are much easier to  read and allow \nyou to relabel folders you might want to reuse. \nYou can get software and printer sheets to make com puter- \ngenerated labels, but I prefer the stand-alone tool . If you have to \nwait to do your filing or labeling as a batch job, you'll most likely \nresist making files for single pieces of paper, and  it'll add the for- \nmality factor, which really puts the brakes on this  system. \nFile Folders \nYou'll need plenty of file folders (get letter size  if you can, legal \nsize if you must). You may also need an equal numbe r of \nPendaflex-style file-folder hangers, if your filing  system requires \nthem. Plain manila folders are fine—color-coding is  a level of \ncomplexity that's hardly ever worth the effort. You r general- \nreference filing system should just be a simple lib rary. \n93 Moment-to-moment\ncollecting, thinking,\nprocessing, and \norganizing are \nchallenging enough;\n",

As I noted earlier, the calendar sh ould be used \nnot \nto hold action lists but to track the \"hard landsca pe\" of things \nthat \nhave to get done on a specific day or at a specific time . \nMost professionals these days already have some sor t of \nworking calendar system in place, ranging from pock et week-at- \na-glance booklets, to loose-leaf organizers with da y-, week-, \nmonth-, and year-at-a-glance options, to single-use r software \norganizers, to group-ware calendars used companywid e, like Out- \nlook or Lotus Notes. \nThe calendar has often been the central tool that p eople \nrely \non to \"get organized.\" It's certainly a critical co mponent in man- \naging particular kinds of data and reminders of the  commitments \nthat relate to specific times and days. There are m any reminders \nand some data that you will want a calendar for, bu t you won't be \nstopping there: your calendar will need to be integ rated with a \nmuch more comprehensive system that will emerge as you apply \nthis method. \nYou may wonder what kind of calendar would be best for you \nto use, and I'll discuss that in more detail in the  next chapter. For \nnow, just keep using the one you've got. After you develop a feel \nfor the whole systematic approach, you'll have a be tter reference \npoint for deciding about graduating to a different tool. \nWastebasket/Recycling Bins \nIf you're like most people, you're going to toss a lot more stuff \nthan you expect, so get ready to create a good bit of trash. Some \nexecutives I have coached have found it extremely u seful to \narrange for a large Dumpster to be parked immediate ly outside \ntheir offices the day we work together! \nCHAPTER 4  |  GETTING STARTED: SETTING UP THE TIME, SPACE, AND  TOOLS \nDo You Need an Organizer? \nWhether or not you'll need an organizer will depend  on",

How do you \nwant to see your reminders of actions, agendas, and  projects? \nWhere and how often might you need to review them? Because \nyour head is not the place in which to hold things, \nyou'll obviously need something to manage your trig- \ngers externally. You could maintain everything in a\npurely low-tech fashion, by keeping pieces of paper\nin folders. Or you could even use a paper-based not e- \nbook or planner, or a digital version thereof. Or y ou \ncould even employ some combination of these. \nAll of the low-tech gear listed in the previous \nsection is used for various aspects of collecting, processing, and \norganizing. You'll use a tray and random paper for collecting. As \nyou process your in-basket, you'll complete many le ss-than-two- \nminute actions that will require Post-its, a staple r, and paper clips. \nThe magazines, articles, and long memos that are yo ur longer- \nthan-two-minute reading will go in another of the t rays. And \nyou'll probably have quite a bit just to file. What 's left—maintain- \ning a project inventory, logging calendar items and  action and \nagenda reminders, and tracking the things you're wa iting for—\nwill require some form of lists, or reviewable groupings of similar \nitems. \nLists can be managed simply in a low-tech way, as p ieces of \npaper kept in a file folder (e.g., separate sheets/ notes for each per- \nson you need to call in a \"Calls\" file), or they ca n be arranged in a \nmore \"mid-tech\" fashion, in loose-leaf notebooks or  planners (a \npage titled \"Calls\" with the names listed down the sheet). Or they \ncan be high-tech, digital versions of paper lists ( such a \"Calls\" \ncategory in the \"To Do\" section of a Palm PDA or in  Microsoft \nOutlook \"Tasks\"). \nIn addition to holding portable reference material (e.g., \ntelephone/address info), most organizers are design ed for managing \n95 Once you know how \nto process your \nstuff and what to \norganize, you really \njust need to create \nand manage lists.\nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  I  PART TWO \nlists.

Probably \nthousands of types of organizers have been on the m arket since the \n1980s, from the early rash of pocket Day-Timers to the current \nflood of high-tech personal digital assistants (PDA s) and PC- \nbased software products like Microsoft Outlook and Lotus Notes. \nShould you implement the Getting Things Done \nprocess into what you're currently using, or should\nyou install something new?

Do yo u \nget a lot of digital information that would be easi er to \ntrack with a digital tool? Do you need a paper-base d \ncalendar for all the appointments you have to make \nand change rapidly on the run? Do you need reminder s of things \nlike calls you have to make when it's not easy to c arry file folders? \nAnd so on. There are also the aesthetic and enjoyme nt factors. \nI've done some of my best planning and updating for  myself when \nI simply wanted some excuse to use (i.e., play with ) my Palm \norganizer while waiting for dinner in a restaurant!\nWhen considering whether to get and use an organize r, and \nif so, which one, keep in mind that all you really need to do is \nmanage lists. You've got to be able to create a lis t on the run and \nreview it easily and as regularly as you need to. O nce you know \nwhat to put on the lists, and how to use them, the medium really \ndoesn't matter. Just go for simplicity, speed, and fun. \nThe Critical Factor of a Filing System \nA simple and highly functional personal reference \nsystem is critical to this process. The filing syst em at \nhand is the first thing I assess before beginning t he \nworkflow process in anyone's office. As I noted in \nchapter 2, the lack of a good general-reference sys - \ntem can be one of the greatest obstacles to imple- \n96 One of the best \ntricks for enhancing \nyour personal\nproductivity is \nhaving organizing \ntools that you love \nto use. \nIf your filing system \nisn't fast, functional, \nand fun, you'll resist \nthe whole process",

How do you \nwant to see your reminders of actions, agendas, and  projects? \nWhere and how often might you need to review them? Because \nyour head is not the place in which to hold things, \nyou'll obviously need something to manage your trig- \ngers externally. You could maintain everything in a\npurely low-tech fashion, by keeping pieces of paper\nin folders. Or you could even use a paper-based not e- \nbook or planner, or a digital version thereof.

What 's left—maintain- \ning a project inventory, logging calendar items and  action and \nagenda reminders, and tracking the things you're wa iting for—\nwill require some form of lists, or reviewable groupings of similar \nitems. \nLists can be managed simply in a low-tech way, as p ieces of \npaper kept in a file folder (e.g., separate sheets/ notes for each per- \nson you need to call in a \"Calls\" file), or they ca n be arranged in a \nmore \"mid-tech\" fashion, in loose-leaf notebooks or  planners (a \npage titled \"Calls\" with the names listed down the sheet).

(Your calendar is actually a form of a list— with time- and \nday-specific action reminders listed chronologicall y.) Probably \nthousands of types of organizers have been on the m arket since the \n1980s, from the early rash of pocket Day-Timers to the current \nflood of high-tech personal digital assistants (PDA s) and PC- \nbased software products like Microsoft Outlook and Lotus Notes. \nShould you implement the Getting Things Done \nprocess into what you're currently using, or should\nyou install something new? The answer is, do \nwhichever one will actually help you change your \nbehavior so you'll use the tools appropriately. The re \nare efficiency factors to consider here, too. Do yo u \nget a lot of digital information that would be easi er to \ntrack with a digital tool? Do you need a paper-base d \ncalendar for all the appointments you have to make \nand change rapidly on the run? Do you need reminder s of things \nlike calls you have to make when it's not easy to c arry file folders? \nAnd so on. There are also the aesthetic and enjoyme nt factors. \nI've done some of my best planning and updating for  myself when \nI simply wanted some excuse to use (i.e., play with ) my Palm \norganizer while waiting for dinner in a restaurant!\nWhen considering whether to get and use an organize r, and \nif so, which one, keep in mind that all you really need to do is \nmanage lists. You've got to be able to create a lis t on the run and \nreview it easily and as regularly as you need to. O nce you know \nwhat to put on the lists, and how to use them, the medium really \ndoesn't matter. Just go for simplicity, speed, and fun. \nThe Critical Factor of a Filing System \nA simple and highly functional personal reference \nsystem is critical to this process.

    "text": " the best \ntricks for enhancing \nyour personal\nproductivity is \nhaving organizing \ntools that you love \nto use. \nIf your filing system \nisn't fast, functional, \nand fun, you'll resist \nthe whole process. \nCHAPTER 4  |  GETTING STARTED: SETTING UP THE TIME, SPACE, AND  TOOLS \nmenting a personal management system, and for most of the execu- \ntives I have personally coached, it represents one of the biggest \nopportunities for improvement. Many times I have dr iven to the \nlocal office-supply store with a client and bought a filing cabinet, \na big stock of file folders, and a labeler, just so  we could create an \nappropriate place in which to put two-thirds of the  \"stuff\" lying \naround his/her desk and credenza and even on the of fice floors. \nWe're concerned here mostly with general-reference filing—\nas distinct from discrete filing systems devoted to  contracts, finan- \ncial information, or other categories of data that deserve their \nown place and indexing. General-reference files sho uld hold arti- \ncles, brochures, pieces of paper, notes, printouts,  faxes—basically \nanything that you want to keep for its interesting or useful data \nand that doesn't fit into your specialized filing s ystems and won't \nstand up by itself on a shelf (as will large softwa re manuals and \nseminar binders). \nIf you have a trusted secretary or assistant who ma intains \nthat system for you, so you can put a \"File as X\" P ost-it on the \ndocument and send it \"out\" to him or her, great. Bu t ask yourself if \nyou still have some personally interesting or confi dential support \nmaterial that should be accessible at any moment, e ven when your \nassistant isn't around. If so, you'll still need yo ur own system, \neither in your desk or right beside it somewhere. \nSuccess Factors for Filing \nI strongly suggest that you maintain your own perso nal, at-hand \nfiling system. It should take you less than one min ute to pick \nsomething up out of your in-basket or print it from  e-mail, decide \nit needs no action but has some potential future va lue, and finish \nstoring it in a trusted system. If it takes you lon ger than a minute \nto complete that sequence of actions, you have a si gnificant \nimprovement opportunity, since you probably won't f ile the docu- \nment; you'll stack it or stuff it instead. Besides being fast, the sys- \ntem needs to be fun and easy, current and complete.  Otherwise \nyou'll unconsciously resist emptying your in-basket  because you \n97 \n98 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY |  PART TWO \nknow there's likely to be something in there that o ught to get filed, \nand you won't even want to look at the papers. Take  heart: I've seen \npeople go from resisting to actually enjoying sorting through their \nstacks once their personal filing system is set up and humming. \nYou must feel equally comfortable about filing a si ngle piece \nof paper on a new topic—even a scribbled note—in it s own file \nas \nyou would about filing a more formal, larger docume nt. Because it \nrequires so much work to make and organize files, p eople either \ndon't keep them or have junked-up cabinets and draw ers full of all \nsorts of one-of-a-kind items, like a menu for the l ocal take-out \ncafe or the current train schedule. \nWhatever you need to do to get your reference syste m to that \nquick and easy standard for everything it has to ho ld, do it. My \nsystem works wonderfully for me and for many others  who try it, \nand I highly recommend that you consider incorporat ing all of \nthe following guidelines to really make reference f iling automatic. \nKeep Your General-Reference Files at Hand's Reach Filing has to \nbe instantaneous and easy. If you have to get up ev ery time you \nhave some ad hoc piece of paper you want to file, y ou'll tend to \nstack it instead of filing it, and you're also like ly to just resist the \nwhole in-basket process (because you subconsciously  know there's \nstuff in there that might need filing!). Many people I have \ncoached have redesigned their office space so they have four \ngeneral-reference file drawers literally in \"swivel  distance,\" instead \nof across their room. \nOne Alpha System I have one A—Z alphabetical filing system, not \nmultiple systems. People have a tendency to want to  use their files \nas a personal organization system,",

Many times I have dr iven to the \nlocal office-supply store with a client and bought a filing cabinet, \na big stock of file folders, and a labeler, just so  we could create an \nappropriate place in which to put two-thirds of the  \"stuff\" lying \naround his/her desk and credenza and even on the of fice floors. \nWe're concerned here mostly with general-reference filing—\nas distinct from discrete filing systems devoted to  contracts, finan- \ncial information, or other categories of data that deserve their \nown place and indexing. General-reference files sho uld hold arti- \ncles, brochures, pieces of paper, notes, printouts,  faxes—basically \nanything that you want to keep for its interesting or useful data \nand that doesn't fit into your specialized filing s ystems and won't \nstand up by itself on a shelf (as will large softwa re manuals and \nseminar binders). \nIf you have a trusted secretary or assistant who ma intains \nthat system for you, so you can put a \"File as X\" P ost-it on the \ndocument and send it \"out\" to him or her, great. Bu t ask yourself if \nyou still have some personally interesting or confi dential support \nmaterial that should be accessible at any moment, e ven when your \nassistant isn't around. If so, you'll still need yo ur own system, \neither in your desk or right beside it somewhere. \nSuccess Factors for Filing \nI strongly suggest that you maintain your own perso nal, at-hand \nfiling system. It should take you less than one min ute to pick \nsomething up out of your in-basket or print it from  e-mail, decide \nit needs no action but has some potential future va lue, and finish \nstoring it in a trusted system. If it takes you",

Because it \nrequires so much work to make and organize files, p eople either \ndon't keep them or have junked-up cabinets and draw ers full of all \nsorts of one-of-a-kind items, like a menu for the l ocal take-out \ncafe or the current train schedule. \nWhatever you need to do to get your reference syste m to that \nquick and easy standard for everything it has to ho ld, do it. My \nsystem works wonderfully for me and for many others  who try it, \nand I highly recommend that you consider incorporat ing all of \nthe following guidelines to really make reference f iling automatic. \nKeep Your General-Reference Files at Hand's Reach Filing has to \nbe instantaneous and easy. If you have to get up ev ery time you \nhave some ad hoc piece of paper you want to file, y ou'll tend to \nstack it instead of filing it, and you're also like ly to just resist the \nwhole in-basket process (because you subconsciously  know there's \nstuff in there that might need filing!). Many people I have \ncoached have redesigned their office space so they have four \ngeneral-reference file drawers literally in",

People have a tendency to want to  use their files \nas a personal organization system, and therefore th ey attempt to \norganize them by projects or areas of focus. This m agnifies geo- \nmetrically the number of places something isn't when you forget \nwhere you filed it. One simple alpha system files e verything by \ntopic, project, person, or company, so it can be in  only three or \nfour places if you forget exactly where you put it.  You can usually \nCHAPTER 4  |  GETTING STARTED: SETTING UP THE TIME, SPACE, AND  TOOLS \nput at least one subset of topics on each label, li ke \"Gardening—\npots\" and \"Gardening—ideas.\" These would be filed u nder G. \nCurrently I have four file drawers for my general-r eference \nfiles, and each is clearly marked on the outside—\"A -E,\" \"F-L,\" \nand so on—so I don't have to think about where some thing goes \nonce it's labeled. \nEvery once in a while someone has such a huge amoun t of \nreference material on one topic or project that it should be put in \nits own discrete drawer or cabinet. But if it is le ss than a half a file \ndrawer's worth, I recommended including it in the s ingle general \nalphabetical system. \nHave Lots of Fresh Folders I keep a giant stack of fresh, new file \nfolders instantly at hand and reachable from where I sit to process \nmy in-basket. Nothing is worse than having somethin g to file and \nnot having an abundance of folders to grab from to make the \nprocess easy. At any given time I want to have an i nventory of \nalmost half a file drawer full of unused or reusabl e folders. Rule of \nthumb: reorder when the number drops below a hundre d. \nKeep the Drawer Less Than Three-Quarters Full Always try to \nkeep your file drawers less than three-quarters ful l. If they're \nstuffed, you'll unconsciously resist putting things  in there, and ref- \nerence materials will tend to stack up instead. If a drawer is start- \ning to get tight, I may purge it while I'm on hold on the phone. \nI know almost no one who doesn't have overstuffed f ile \ndrawers. If you value your cuticles, and if you wan t to get rid of your \nunconscious resistance to filing, then you must kee p the drawers \nloose enough that you can insert and retrieve files  without effort. \nSome people's reaction to this is \"I'd have to buy more file cabi- \nnets!\" as if that were something horrible. Help me out here. If the \nstuff is worth keeping, it's worth keeping so that it's easily accessible, \nright? And if it's not, then why are you keeping it ? It's said that we're \nin the Information Age; if there's any validity to that, and if you're \ndoing anything that hinders your usage of it... not smart. \n99 \n100 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  |  PART TWO \nYou may need to create another tier of reference st orage to \ngive yourself sufficient working room with your gen eral-reference \nfiles at hand. Material such as finished project no tes and \"dead\" \nclient files may still need to be kept, but can be stored off-site or at \nleast out of your work space. \nLabel Your File Folders with an Auto Labeler Typeset labels change \nthe nature of your files and your relationship to t hem. Labeled files \nfeel comfortable on a boardroom table; everyone can  identify them; \nyou can easily see what they are from a distance an d in your brief- \ncase; and when you open your file drawers, you get to see what looks \nalmost like a printed index of your files in alphab etical order. It \nmakes it fun to open the drawer to find or insert t hings. \nPerhaps later in this new millennium the brain scie ntists will \ngive us some esoteric and complex neurological expl anation for why \nlabeled files work so effectively. Until then, trus t me. Get a labeler. \nAnd get your own. To make the whole system work without a hitch, \nyou'll need to have it at hand all the time, so you can file something \nwhenever you want. And don't share! If you have som ething to file \nand your labeler's not there, you'll just stack the  material instead of \nfiling it. The labeler should be as basic a tool",

People have a tendency to want to  use their files \nas a personal organization system, and therefore th ey attempt to \norganize them by projects or areas of focus. This m agnifies geo- \nmetrically the number of places something isn't when you forget \nwhere you filed it. One simple alpha system files e verything by \ntopic, project, person, or company, so it can be in  only three or \nfour places if you forget exactly where you put it.

But if it is le ss than a half a file \ndrawer's worth, I recommended including it in the s ingle general \nalphabetical system. \nHave Lots of Fresh Folders I keep a giant stack of fresh, new file \nfolders instantly at hand and reachable from where I sit to process \nmy in-basket. Nothing is worse than having somethin g to file and \nnot having an abundance of folders to grab from to make the \nprocess easy. At any given time I want to have an i nventory of \nalmost half a file drawer full of unused or reusabl e folders. Rule of \nthumb: reorder when the number drops below a hundre d. \nKeep the Drawer Less Than Three-Quarters Full Always try to \nkeep your file drawers less than three-quarters ful l. If they're \nstuffed, you'll unconsciously resist putting things  in there, and ref- \nerence materials will tend to stack up instead.

If a drawer is start- \ning to get tight, I may purge it while I'm on hold on the phone. \nI know almost no one who doesn't have overstuffed f ile \ndrawers. If you value your cuticles, and if you wan t to get rid of your \nunconscious resistance to filing, then you must kee p the drawers \nloose enough that you can insert and retrieve files  without effort. \nSome people's reaction to this is \"I'd have to buy more file cabi- \nnets!\" as if that were something horrible. Help me out here. If the \nstuff is worth keeping, it's worth keeping so that it's easily accessible, \nright? And if it's not, then why are you keeping it ? It's said that we're \nin the Information Age; if there's any validity to that, and if you're \ndoing anything that hinders your usage of it... not smart. \n99 \n100 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  |  PART TWO \nYou may need to create another tier of reference st orage to \ngive yourself sufficient working room with your gen eral-reference \nfiles at hand. Material such as finished project no tes and \"dead\" \nclient files may still need to be kept, but can be stored off-site or at \nleast out of your work space. \nLabel Your File Folders with an Auto Labeler Typeset labels change \nthe nature of your files and your relationship to t hem. Labeled files \nfeel comfortable on a boardroom table; everyone can  identify them; \nyou can easily see what they are from a distance an d in your brief- \ncase; and when you open your file drawers, you get to see what looks \nalmost like a printed index of your files in alphab etical order. It \nmakes it fun to open the drawer to find or insert t hings. \nPerhaps later in this new millennium the brain scie ntists will \ngive us some esoteric and complex neurological expl anation for why \nlabeled files work so effectively. Until then, trus t me. Get a labeler. \nAnd get your own. To make the whole system work without a hitch, \nyou'll need to have it at hand all the time, so you can file something \n",

    "text": "whenever you want. And don't share! If you have som ething to file \nand your labeler's not there, you'll just stack the  material instead of \nfiling it. The labeler should be as basic a tool as  your stapler. \nGet High-Quality Mechanics File cabinets are not the place to \nskimp on quality. Nothing is worse than trying to o pen a heavy \nfile drawer and hearing that awful screech! that happens when you \nwrestle with the roller bearings on one of those $2 9.95 \"special \nsale\" cabinets. You really need a file cabinet whos e drawer, even \nwhen it's three-quarters full, will glide open and click shut with \nthe smoothness and solidity of a door on a German c ar. I'm not \nkidding. \nGet Rid of Hanging Files If You Can At the risk of seriously \noffending a lot of people who are already using han ging files, I \nrecommend that you totally do away with the hanging -file hard- \nware and use just plain folders standing up by them selves in the \nCHAPTER 4 |  GETTING STARTED: SETTING UP THE TIME, SPACE, AND  TOOLS \nfile drawer, held up by the movable metal plate in the back. Hang- \ning folders are much less efficient because of the effort it takes to \nmake a new file ad hoc and the formality that impos es on the fil- \ning system. \nHere's an e-mail I received recently from a senior manager \nwho actually took my advice after avoiding it for a  couple of years \nbecause of his investment in the hanging hardware: \nYour system is FANTASTIC!! I've completely redone m y files at \nhome and at work —it only took a combined four days to do it, \nbut I've done away with Pendaflex and have gone to t he manila \nfolder system, with A-Z and nothing else. WOW! It's  so much \neasier. My desk for some reason is a lot neater, to o, without those \nstacks of \"to be filed\" stuff hanging around! \nBut If You Can't ... Many people are stuck with \nthe hanging-file system, at least at work, because \nside-opening hanging-folder filing cabinets have \nbecome standard corporate issue. If you have to wor k \nwith hanging files, then I recommend that you: \n• Label the files, not the hangers. That lets you c arry \nthe file folders for meetings and when traveling, \nwithout taking the hanger. In the fire zone of\nreal work, if it takes \nlonger than sixty \nseconds to file \nsomething, you \nwon't file, you'll\nstack.\n• Use only one file folder per hanger. This will keep the drawer visu- \nally neat and prevent the weirdness that results wh en multiple \nfiles make a hanger uneven. Having to recalibrate f iles in an \nalpha system every time a folder gets full is too m uch trouble. \n• Keep a big supply of plain hangers and new file fol ders in the \nfront of your first file drawer so you can make new  files and store \nthem in a flash. \n101 \n102 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  |  PART TWO \nPurge Your Files at Least Once a Year Cleaning house in your files \nregularly keeps them from going stale and seeming l ike a black \nhole, and it also gives you the freedom to keep any thing on a \nwhim \"in case you might need it.\" You know everythi ng will be \nreassessed within a few months anyway, and you can redecide \nthen what's worth keeping and what isn't. As I say,  I purge my \nfiles while I'm on hold on the phone (or marking ti me on a con- \nference call that's dragging on and on!). \nI recommend that all organizations (if they don't h ave one \nalready) establish a Dumpster Day, when all employe es get to \ncome to work in sneakers and jeans, put their phone s on do-not- \ndisturb, and get current with all their stored stuf f.* Dumpsters are \nbrought in, and everyone has permission to spend th e whole day \nin purge mode. A personal Dumpster Day is an ideal thing to put \ninto your tickler file, either during the holidays,  at year's end, or \naround early-spring tax-preparation time, when you might want \nto tie it in with archiving the previous year's fin ancial files. \nOne Final Thing to Prepare . . . \nYou've blocked off some time, you've gotten a work area set up, \nand you've got the basic tools to start implementin g the method- \nology. Now what? \nIf you've",

Hang- \ning folders are much less efficient because of the effort it takes to \nmake a new file ad hoc and the formality that impos es on the fil- \ning system. \nHere's an e-mail I received recently from a senior manager \nwho actually took my advice after avoiding it for a  couple of years \nbecause of his investment in the hanging hardware: \nYour system is FANTASTIC!! I've completely redone m y files at \nhome and at work —it only took a combined four days to do it, \nbut I've done away with Pendaflex and have gone to t he manila \nfolder system, with A-Z and nothing else. WOW! It's  so much \neasier. My desk for some reason is a lot neater, to o, without those \nstacks of \"to be filed\" stuff hanging around! \nBut If You Can't ... Many people are stuck",

If you have to wor k \nwith hanging files, then I recommend that you: \n• Label the files, not the hangers. That lets you c arry \nthe file folders for meetings and when traveling, \nwithout taking the hanger. In the fire zone of\nreal work, if it takes \nlonger than sixty \nseconds to file \nsomething, you \nwon't file, you'll\nstack.\n• Use only one file folder per hanger. This will keep the drawer visu- \nally neat and prevent the weirdness that results wh en multiple \nfiles make a hanger uneven. Having to recalibrate f iles in an \nalpha system every time a folder gets full is too m uch trouble. \n• Keep a big supply of plain hangers and new file fol ders in the \nfront of your first file drawer so you can make new  files and store \nthem in a flash. \n101 \n102 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  |  PART TWO \nPurge Your Files at Least Once a Year Cleaning house in your files \nregularly keeps them from going stale and seeming l ike a black \nhole, and it also gives you the freedom to keep any thing on a \nwhim \"in case you might need it.\" You know everythi ng will be \nreassessed within a few months anyway, and you can redecide \nthen what's worth keeping and what isn't. As I say,  I purge my \nfiles while I'm on hold on the phone (or marking ti me on a con- \nference call that's dragging on and on!). \nI recommend that all organizations (if they don't h ave one \nalready) establish a Dumpster Day, when all employe es get to \ncome to work in sneakers and jeans, put their phone s on do-not- \ndisturb, and get current with all their stored stuf f.* Dumpsters are \nbrought in, and everyone has permission to spend th e whole day \nin purge mode. A personal Dumpster Day is an ideal thing to put \ninto your tickler file, either during the holidays,  at year's end, or \naround early-spring tax-preparation time, when you might want \nto tie it in with archiving the previous year's fin ancial files. \nOne",

If you have to wor k \nwith hanging files, then I recommend that you: \n• Label the files, not the hangers. That lets you c arry \nthe file folders for meetings and when traveling, \nwithout taking the hanger. In the fire zone of\nreal work, if it takes \nlonger than sixty \nseconds to file \nsomething, you \nwon't file, you'll\nstack.\n• Use only one file folder per hanger. This will keep the drawer visu- \nally neat and prevent the weirdness that results wh en multiple \nfiles make a hanger uneven. Having to recalibrate f iles in an \nalpha system every time a folder gets full is too m uch trouble. \n• Keep a big supply of plain hangers and new file fol ders in the \nfront of your first file drawer so you can make new  files and store \nthem in a flash. \n101 \n102 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  |  PART TWO \nPurge Your Files at Least Once a Year Cleaning house in your files \nregularly keeps",

It's critical that your fu ll psychic atten- \ntion be available for the work at hand. \nAlmost without exception, when I sit down to begin coach- \ning people, even though they've blocked out time an d committed \nsignificant money to utilize me as a resource for t hat time, they \nstill have things they're going to have to do befor e we quit for the \nday, and they haven't arranged for them yet in thei r own systems. \n\"Oh, yeah, I've got to call this client back someti me today,\" they'll \nsay, or \"I have to check in with my spouse to see i f he's gotten the \ntickets for tonight.\" It bespeaks a certain lack of  awareness and \nmaturity in our culture, I think, that so many soph isticated people \nare ignoring those levels of responsibility to thei r own psyche, on \nan ongoing operational basis. \nSo have you handled all that?
