Your job is to\nidentify it clearly.\nAsk yourself these questions: What is holding you back? What sets\nthe speed at which you achieve your goals? What determines how\nfast you move from where you are to where you want to go? What\nstops you or holds you back from eating the frogs that can reallymake a difference? Why aren’t you at your goal already?\nThese are some of the most important questions you will ever ask\nand answer achieving high levels of personal productivity and\neffectiveness. Whatever you have to do, there is always a limiting\nfactor that determines how quickly and well you get it done. Your job\nis to study the task and identify the limiting factor or constraint\nwithin it. You must then focus all of your energies on alleviating that\nsingle chokepoint.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 80Identify the Limiting Factor\nIn virtually every task, large or small, there is a single factor that sets\nthe speed at which you achieve the goal or complete the job. What isit? Concentrate your mental energies on that one key area. This can bethe most productive use of your time and talents.\nThis constraint may be a person whose help or decision you need, a\nresource that you require, a weakness in some part of the organizationor something else. But it the limiting factor always there and it is\nalways your job to find it.\nFor example, the purpose of a business is to create and keep a customer.\nBy doing this in sufficient quantities, the company makes a profit and\ncontinues to grow and flourish.\nIn every business there is a limiting factor or chokepoint that determines\nhow quickly and well the company achieves this purpose. It may be the\nmarketing, the level of sales or the sales force itself. It may be the costs of\noperation or the methods of production. It may be the level of cash flow\nor costs. The success of the company may be determined by the\ncompetition, the customers or the current marketplace. One of these\nfactors, more than anything else, determines how quickly the company\nachieves its goals of growth and profitability. What is it?\nThe accurate identification of the limiting factor in any process and the\nfocus on that factor can usually bring about more progress in a shorter\nperiod of time than any other single activity.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 81The 80/20 Rule Applied to Constraints\nThe 80/20 Rule also applies to the constraints in your life and in your\nwork. What this means is that 80% of the constraints, the factors thatare holding you back from achieving your goals, are internal. Theyare within yourself, within your own personal qualities, abilities,\nhabits, disciplines or competencies. Or they are contained within\nyour own company or organization.\nOnly 20% of the limiting factors are external  to you or to your\norganization. Only 20% are on the outside, in the form of\ncompetition, markets, governments or other organizations.\nYour key constraint can be something small and not particularly\nobvious. Sometimes it requires that you make a list of every step in\nthe process and examine every activity to determine exactly what it isthat is holding you back. Sometimes, it can be a single negative\nperception or objection on the part of the customers that is slowing\ndown the entire sales process. Sometimes it is the absence of a single\nfeature that is holding back the growth of sales of a product or\nservice line.\nLook into your company honestly. Look within your boss, your\ncoworkers and members of your staff to see if there is a key weakness\nthat is holding you or the company back, which is acting as a brake\non the achievement of your key goals.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 82Look Into Yourself\nIn your own life, you must have the honesty to look deeply into\nyourself for the limiting factor or limiting skill that sets the speed atwhich you achieve your own personal goals.\nSuccessful people always begin the analysis of constraints by asking\nthe question, \"What is it in me that is holding me back?\" They accept\ncomplete responsibility for their lives and look to themselves for boththe cause and cure of their problems.\nKeep asking, \"What sets the speed at which I get the results I want?\"\nStrive for Accuracy\nThe definition of the constraint determines the strategy that you use\nto alleviate it. The failure to identify the correct constraint, or the\nidentification of the wrong constraint, can lead you off in the wrong\n",

Your job is to\nidentify it clearly.\nAsk yourself these questions: What is holding you back? What sets\nthe speed at which you achieve your goals? What determines how\nfast you move from where you are to where you want to go? What\nstops you or holds you back from eating the frogs that can reallymake a difference? Why aren’t you at your goal already?\nThese are some of the most important questions you will ever ask\nand answer achieving high levels of personal productivity and\neffectiveness. Whatever you have to do, there is always a limiting\nfactor that determines how quickly and well you get it done. Your job\nis to study the task and identify the limiting factor or constraint\nwithin it. You must then focus all of your energies on alleviating that\nsingle chokepoint.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 80Identify the Limiting Factor\nIn virtually every task, large or small, there is a single factor that sets\nthe speed at which you achieve the goal or complete the job. What isit? Concentrate your mental energies on that one key area. This can bethe most productive use of your time and talents.\nThis constraint may be a person whose help or decision you need, a\nresource that you require, a weakness in some part of the organizationor something else. But it the limiting factor always there and it is\nalways your job to find it.\nFor example, the purpose of a business is to create and keep a customer.\nBy doing this in sufficient quantities, the company makes a profit and\ncontinues to grow and flourish.\nIn every business there is a limiting factor or chokepoint that determines\nhow quickly and well the company achieves this purpose. It may be the\nmarketing, the level of sales or the sales force itself. It may be the costs of\noperation or the methods of production. It may be the level of cash flow\nor costs. The success of the company may be determined by the\ncompetition, the customers or the current marketplace. One of these\nfactors, more than anything else, determines",

Your job is to\nidentify it clearly.\nAsk yourself these questions: What is holding you back? What sets\nthe speed at which you achieve your goals? What determines how\nfast you move from where you are to where you want to go? What\nstops you or holds you back from eating the frogs that can reallymake a difference? Why aren’t you at your goal already?\nThese are some of the most important questions you will ever ask\nand answer achieving high levels of personal productivity and\neffectiveness. Whatever you have to do, there is always a limiting\nfactor that determines how quickly and well you get it done. Your job\nis to study the task and identify the limiting factor or constraint\nwithin it. You must then focus all of your energies on alleviating that\nsingle chokepoint.\nEAT THAT FROG",

One of these\nfactors, more than anything else, determines how quickly the company\nachieves its goals of growth and profitability. What is it?\nThe accurate identification of the limiting factor in any process and the\nfocus on that factor can usually bring about more progress in a shorter\nperiod of time than any other single activity.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 81The 80/20 Rule Applied to Constraints\nThe 80/20 Rule also applies to the constraints in your life and in your\nwork. What this means is that 80% of the constraints, the factors thatare holding you back from achieving your goals, are internal. Theyare within yourself, within your own personal qualities, abilities,\nhabits, disciplines or competencies. Or they are contained within\nyour own company or organization.\nOnly 20% of the limiting factors are external  to you or to your\norganization. Only 20% are on the outside, in the form of\ncompetition, markets, governments or other organizations.\nYour key constraint can be something small and not particularly\nobvious.

Sometimes it is the absence of a single\nfeature that is holding back the growth of sales of a product or\nservice line.\nLook into your company honestly. Look within your boss, your\ncoworkers and members of your staff to see if there is a key weakness\nthat is holding you or the company back, which is acting as a brake\non the achievement of your key goals.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 82Look Into Yourself\nIn your own life, you must have the honesty to look deeply into\nyourself for the limiting factor or limiting skill that sets the speed atwhich you achieve your own personal goals.\nSuccessful people always begin the analysis of constraints by asking\nthe question, \"What is it in me that is holding me back?\" They accept\ncomplete responsibility for their lives and look to themselves for boththe cause and cure of their problems.\nKeep asking, \"What sets the speed at which I get the",

    "text": " results I want?\"\nStrive for Accuracy\nThe definition of the constraint determines the strategy that you use\nto alleviate it. The failure to identify the correct constraint, or the\nidentification of the wrong constraint, can lead you off in the wrong\ndirection. You can end up solving the wrong problem.\nA major corporation, a client of mine, was experiencing declining\nsales. They concluded that the major constraint was the sales force\nand sales management. They spent an enormous amount of money\nreorganizing the management and retraining the salespeople.\nThey later found that the primary reason that their sales were down\nwas a mistake made by an accountant that had accidentally priced\ntheir products too high relative to their competition in the\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 83marketplace.  Once they revamped their pricing, their sales went\nback up and they returned to profitability.\nBehind every constraint or chokepoint, once it is located and alleviated\nsuccessfully, you will find another constraint or limiting factor.Whether it is getting to work on time in the morning, or building a\nsuccessful career, there are always limiting factors and bottlenecks that\nset the speed of your progress. Your job is to find them and to focusyour energies on alleviating them as quickly as possible.\nOften, starting off your day with the removal of a key bottleneck or\nconstraint fills you full of energy and personal power. It propels youinto following through and completing the job. And there is always\nsomething. Often alleviating a key constraint or limiting factor is the\nmost important frog you could eat at that moment.\nEat That Frog!\n1.  Identify your most important goal in life today. What is it? What\none goal, if you achieved it, would have the greatest positive effect on\nyour life? What one career accomplishment would have the greatest\npositive impact on your work life?\n2.  Determine the one constraint, internal or external that sets the\nspeed at which you accomplish this goal. Ask:  “Why don’t I have it\nalready? What is it in me that is holding me back?” Whatever your\nanswers, take action immediately. Do something. Do anything, but\nget started.",

The failure to identify the correct constraint, or the\nidentification of the wrong constraint, can lead you off in the wrong\ndirection. You can end up solving the wrong problem.\nA major corporation, a client of mine, was experiencing declining\nsales. They concluded that the major constraint was the sales force\nand sales management. They spent an enormous amount of money\nreorganizing the management and retraining the salespeople.\nThey later found that the primary reason that their sales were down\nwas a mistake made by an accountant that had accidentally priced\ntheir products too high relative to their competition in the\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 83marketplace.  Once they revamped their pricing, their sales went\nback up and they returned to profitability.\nBehind every constraint or chokepoint, once it is located and alleviated\nsuccessfully, you will find another constraint or limiting factor.Whether it is getting to work on time in the morning, or building a\nsuccessful career, there are always limiting factors and bottlenecks that\nset the speed of your progress. Your job is to find them and to focusyour energies on alleviating them as quickly as possible.\nOften, starting off your day with the removal of a key bottleneck or\nconstraint fills you full of energy and personal power. It propels youinto following through and completing the job. And there is always\nsomething. Often alleviating a key constraint or limiting factor is the\nmost important frog you could eat at that moment.\nEat That Frog!\n1.  Identify your most important goal in life today. What is it? What\none goal, if you achieved it, would have the greatest positive effect on\nyour life? What one career accomplishment would have the greatest\npositive impact on your work life?\n2.  Determine the one constraint, internal or external that sets the\nspeed at which you accomplish this goal. Ask:  “Why don’t I have it\nalready? What is it in me that is holding me back?” Whatever your\nanswers, take action immediately. Do something. Do anything, but\nget started.",

The failure to identify the correct constraint, or the\nidentification of the wrong constraint, can lead you off in the wrong\ndirection. You can end up solving the wrong problem.\nA major corporation, a client of mine, was experiencing declining\nsales. They concluded that the major constraint was the sales force\nand sales management. They spent an enormous amount of money\nreorganizing the management and retraining the salespeople.\nThey later found that the primary reason that their sales were down\nwas a mistake made by an accountant that had accidentally priced\ntheir products too high relative to their competition in the\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 83marketplace.  Once they revamped their pricing, their sales went\nback up and they returned to profitability.\nBehind every constraint or chokepoint, once it is located and alleviated\nsuccessfully, you will find another constraint or limiting factor.Whether it is getting to work on time in the morning, or building a\nsuccessful career, there are always limiting factors and bottlenecks that\nset the speed of your progress. Your job is to find them and to focusyour energies on alleviating",

Your job is to find them and to focusyour energies on alleviating them as quickly as possible.\nOften, starting off your day with the removal of a key bottleneck or\nconstraint fills you full of energy and personal power. It propels youinto following through and completing the job. And there is always\nsomething. Often alleviating a key constraint or limiting factor is the\nmost important frog you could eat at that moment.\nEat That Frog!\n1.  Identify your most important goal in life today. What is it? What\none goal, if you achieved it, would have the greatest positive effect on\nyour life? What one career accomplishment would have the greatest\npositive impact on your work life?\n2.  Determine the one constraint, internal or external that sets the\nspeed at which you accomplish this goal. Ask:  “Why don’t I have it\nalready? What is it in me that is holding me back?” Whatever your\nanswers, take action immediately. Do something. Do anything, but\nget started.",
