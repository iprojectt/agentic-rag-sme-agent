    "text": "Rule #2\nEmbrace Boredom\nTo better understand how one masters \nthe art of deep work, I suggest visiting \nthe Knesses Yisroel Synagogue in Spring \nValley, New York, at six a.m on a \nweekday morning. If you do, you’ll \nlikely find at least twenty cars in the \nparking lot. Inside, you’ll encounter a \ncouple dozen members of the\n\ncongregation working over texts— some \nmight be reading silently, mouthing the \nwords of an ancient language, while \nothers are paired together debating. At \none end of the room a rabbi will be \nleading a larger group in a discussion. \nThis early morning gathering in Spring \nValley represents just a small fraction of \nthe hundreds of thousands of orthodox \nJews who will wake up early that \nmorning, as they do every weekday \nmorning, to practice a central tenet of \ntheir faith: to spend time every day \nstudying the complex written traditions \nof Rabbinic Judaism.\nI was introduced to this world by \nAdam Marlin, a member of the Knesses\n\nYisroel congregation and one of the \nregulars at its morning study group. As \nMarlin explained to me, his goal with \nthis practice is to decipher one Talmud \npage each day (though he sometimes \nfails to make it even this far), often \nworking with a chevruta  (study partner) \nto push his understanding closer to his \ncognitive limit.\nWhat interests me about Marlin is not \nhis knowledge of ancient texts, but \ninstead the type of effort required to gain \nthis knowledge. When I interviewed \nhim, he emphasized the mental intensity \nof his morning ritual. “It’s an extreme \nand serious discipline, consisting mostly \nof the ‘deep work’  stuff [you write\n\nabout],” he explained. “I run a growing \nbusiness, but this is often the hardest \nbrain strain I do.” This strain is not \nunique to Marlin but is instead ingrained \nin the practice—as his rabbi once \nexplained to him: “You cannot consider \nyourself as fulfilling this daily obligation \nunless you have stretched to the reaches \nof your mental capacity.”\nUnlike many orthodox Jews, Marlin \ncame late to his faith, not starting his \nrigorous Talmud training until his \ntwenties. This bit of trivia proves useful \nto our purposes because it allows \nMarlin a clear before-and-after \ncomparison concerning the impact of \nthese mental calisthenics—and the result\n\nsurprised him. Though Marlin was \nexceptionally well educated when he \nbegan the practice—he holds three  \ndifferent  Ivy League degrees—he soon \nmet fellow adherents who had only ever \nattended small religious schools but \ncould still “dance intellectual circles” \naround him. “A number of these people \nare highly successful [professionally],” \nhe explained to me, “but it wasn’t some \nfancy school that pushed their intellect \nhigher; it became clear it was instead \ntheir daily study that started as early as \nthe fifth grade.”\nAfter a while, Marlin began to notice \npositive changes in his own ability to \nthink deeply. “I’ve recently been making\n\nmore highly creative insights in my \nbusiness life,” he told me. “I’m \nconvinced it’s related to this daily \nmental practice. This consistent strain \nhas built my mental muscle over years \nand years. This was not the goal when I \nstarted, but it is the effect.”\nAdam Marlin’s experience underscores \nan important reality about deep work: \nThe ability to concentrate intensely is a \nskill that must be trained. This idea \nmight sound obvious once it’s pointed \nout, but it represents a departure from \nhow most people understand such \nmatters. In my experience, it’s common \nto treat undistracted concentration as a\n\nhabit  like flossing—something that you \nknow how to do and know is good for \nyou, but that you’ve been neglecting due \nto a lack of motivation. This mind-set is \nappealing because it implies you can \ntransform your working life from \ndistracted to focused overnight if you \ncan simply muster enough motivation. \nBut this understanding ignores the \ndifficulty of focus and the hours of \npractice necessary to strengthen your \n“mental muscle.” The creative insights \nthat Adam Marlin now experiences in \nhis professional life, in other words, \nhave little to do with a onetime decision \nto think deeper, and much to do with a \ncommitment to training this ability early\n\nevery morning.\nThere is, however, an important \ncorollary to this idea: Efforts to deepen \nyour focus will struggle if you don’t \nsimultaneously wean your mind from a \ndependence on distraction. Much in the \nsame way that athletes must take care",

    "text": "Rule #2\nEmbrace Boredom\nTo better understand how one masters \nthe art of deep work, I suggest visiting \nthe Knesses Yisroel Synagogue in Spring \nValley, New York, at six a.m on a \nweekday morning. If you do, you’ll \nlikely find at least twenty cars in the \nparking lot. Inside, you’ll encounter a \ncouple dozen members of the\n\ncongregation working over texts— some \nmight be reading silently, mouthing the \nwords of an ancient language, while \nothers are paired together debating. At \none end of the room a rabbi will be \nleading a larger group in a discussion. \nThis early morning gathering in Spring \nValley represents just a small fraction of \nthe hundreds of thousands of orthodox \nJews who will wake up early that \nmorning, as they do every weekday \nmorning, to practice a central tenet of \ntheir faith: to spend time every day \nstudying the complex written traditions \nof Rabbinic Judaism.\nI was introduced to this world by \nAdam Marlin, a member of the Knesses\n\nYisroel congregation and one of the \nregulars at its morning study group. As \nMarlin explained to me, his goal with \nthis practice is to decipher one Talmud \npage each day (though he sometimes \nfails to make it even this far), often \nworking with a chevruta  (study partner) \nto push his understanding closer to his \ncognitive limit.\nWhat interests me about Marlin is not \nhis knowledge of ancient texts, but \ninstead the type of effort required to gain \nthis knowledge. When I interviewed \nhim, he emphasized the mental intensity \nof his morning ritual. “It’s an extreme \nand serious discipline, consisting mostly \nof the ‘deep work’  stuff [you write\n\nabout],” he explained. “I run a growing \nbusiness, but this is often the hardest \nbrain strain I do.” This strain is not \nunique to Marlin but is instead ingrained \nin the practice—as his rabbi once \nexplained to him: “You cannot consider \nyourself as fulfilling this daily obligation \nunless you have stretched to the reaches \nof your mental capacity.”\nUnlike many orthodox Jews, Marlin \ncame late to his faith, not starting his \nrigorous Talmud training until his \ntwenties. This bit of trivia proves useful \nto our purposes because it",

Inside, you’ll encounter a \ncouple dozen members of the\n\ncongregation working over texts— some \nmight be reading silently, mouthing the \nwords of an ancient language, while \nothers are paired together debating. At \none end of the room a rabbi will be \nleading a larger group in a discussion. \nThis early morning gathering in Spring \nValley represents just a small fraction of \nthe hundreds of thousands of orthodox \nJews who will wake up early that \nmorning, as they do every weekday \nmorning, to practice a central tenet of \ntheir faith: to spend time every day \nstudying the complex written traditions \nof Rabbinic Judaism.\nI was introduced to this world by \nAdam Marlin, a member of the Knesses\n\nYisroel congregation and one of the \nregulars at its morning study group.

As \nMarlin explained to me, his goal with \nthis practice is to decipher one Talmud \npage each day (though he sometimes \nfails to make it even this far), often \nworking with a chevruta  (study partner) \nto push his understanding closer to his \ncognitive limit.\nWhat interests me about Marlin is not \nhis knowledge of ancient texts, but \ninstead the type of effort required to gain \nthis knowledge. When I interviewed \nhim, he emphasized the mental intensity \nof his morning ritual. “It’s an extreme \nand serious discipline, consisting mostly \nof the ‘deep work’  stuff [you write\n\nabout],” he explained. “I run a growing \nbusiness, but this is often the hardest \nbrain strain I do.” This strain is not \nunique to Marlin but is instead ingrained \nin the practice—as his rabbi once \nexplained to him: “You cannot consider \nyourself as fulfilling this daily obligation \nunless you have stretched to",

    "text": " the reaches \nof your mental capacity.”\nUnlike many orthodox Jews, Marlin \ncame late to his faith, not starting his \nrigorous Talmud training until his \ntwenties. This bit of trivia proves useful \nto our purposes because it allows \nMarlin a clear before-and-after \ncomparison concerning the impact of \nthese mental calisthenics—and the result\n\nsurprised him. Though Marlin was \nexceptionally well educated when he \nbegan the practice—he holds three  \ndifferent  Ivy League degrees—he soon \nmet fellow adherents who had only ever \nattended small religious schools but \ncould still “dance intellectual circles” \naround him. “A number of these people \nare highly successful [professionally],” \nhe explained to me, “but it wasn’t some \nfancy school that pushed their intellect \nhigher; it became clear it was instead \ntheir daily study that started as early as \nthe fifth grade.”\nAfter a while, Marlin began to notice \npositive changes in his own ability to \nthink deeply. “I’ve recently been making\n\nmore highly creative insights in my \nbusiness life,” he told me. “I’m \nconvinced it’s related to this daily \nmental practice. This consistent strain \nhas built my mental muscle over years \nand years. This was not the goal when I \nstarted, but it is the effect.”\nAdam Marlin’s experience underscores \nan important reality about deep work: \nThe ability to concentrate intensely is a \nskill that must be trained. This idea \nmight sound obvious once it’s pointed \nout, but it represents a departure from \nhow most people understand such \nmatters. In my experience, it’s common \nto treat undistracted concentration as a\n\nhabit  like flossing—something that you \nknow how to do and know is good for \nyou, but that you’ve been neglecting due \nto a lack of motivation. This mind-set is \nappealing because it implies you can \ntransform your working life from \ndistracted to focused overnight if you \ncan simply muster enough motivation. \nBut this understanding ignores the \ndifficulty of focus and the hours of \npractice necessary to strengthen your \n“mental muscle.” The creative insights \nthat Adam Marlin now experiences in \nhis professional life, in other words, \nhave little to do with a onetime decision \nto think deeper, and much to do with a \ncommitment to training this ability early\n\nevery morning.\nThere is, however",

    "text": ", an important \ncorollary to this idea: Efforts to deepen \nyour focus will struggle if you don’t \nsimultaneously wean your mind from a \ndependence on distraction. Much in the \nsame way that athletes must take care of \ntheir bodies outside of their training \nsessions, you’ll struggle to achieve the \ndeepest levels of concentration if you \nspend the rest of your time fleeing the \nslightest hint of boredom\nWe can find evidence for this claim \nin the research of Clifford Nass, the late \nStanford communications professor who \nwas well known for his study of \nbehavior in the digital age. Among other\n\ninsights, Nass’s research revealed that \nconstant attention switching online has a \nlasting negative effect on your brain. \nHere’s Nass summarizing these findings \nin a 2010 interview with NPR’s Ira \nFlatow:\nSo we have scales that allow us  \nto divide up people into people  \nwho multitask all the time and  \npeople who rarely do, and the  \ndifferences are remarkable.  \nPeople who multitask all the  \ntime can’ t filter out irrelevancy.  \nThey can’ t manage a working  \nmemory. They ’ re chronically  \ndistracted. They initiate much\n\nlarger parts o f their brain that  \nare irrelevant to the task at  \nhand... they’ re pretty much  \nmental wrecks.\nAt this point Flatow asks Nass \nwhether the chronically distracted \nrecognize this rewiring of their brain:\nThe people we talk with  \ncontinually said, “ look, when I  \nreally have to concentrate, I  turn  \no ff everything and I  am laser-  \nfocused. ”  And unfortunately, \nthey’ve developed habits of mind \nthat make it impossible for them \nto be laser-focused. They’ re\n\nsuckers fo r irrelevancy. They  \njust can’ t keep on task.  \n[emphasis mine]\nOnce your brain has become \naccustomed to on-demand distraction, \nNass discovered, it’s hard to shake the \naddiction even when you want  to \nconcentrate. To put this more concretely: \nIf every moment of potential boredom in \nyour life— say, having to wait five \nminutes in line or sit alone in a \nrestaurant until a friend arrives—is \nrelieved with a quick glance at your \nsmartphone, then your brain has likely \nbeen rewired to a point where, like the \n“mental wrecks” in Nass’s research, it’s\n\nnot ready for deep work—even if you \nregularly schedule time to practice this \nconcentration.\nRule #1 taught you how to integrate deep \nwork into your schedule and support it \nwith routines and rituals designed to \nhelp you consistently reach the current \nlimit of your concentration ability. Rule \n#2 will help you significantly improve \nthis limit. The strategies that follow are \nmotivated by the key idea that getting the \nmost out of your deep work habit \nrequires training, and as clarified \npreviously, this training must address \ntwo goals: improving your ability to \nconcentrate intensely and overcoming\n\nyour desire for distraction. These \nstrategies cover a variety of approaches, \nfrom quarantining distraction to \nmastering a special form of meditation, \nthat combine to provide a practical road \nmap for your journey from a mind \nwrecked by constant distraction and \nunfamiliar with concentration, to an \ninstrument that truly does deliver laser­\nlike focus.\nDon’t Take Breaks from \nDistraction. Instead Take \nBreaks from Focus.\nMany assume that they can switch\n\nbetween a state of distraction and one of \nconcentration as needed, but as I just \nargued, this assumption is optimistic: \nOnce you’re wired for distraction, you \ncrave it. Motivated by this reality, this \nstrategy is designed to help you rewire \nyour brain to a configuration better \nsuited to staying on task.\nBefore diving into the details, let’s \nstart by considering a popular suggestion \nfor distraction addiction that doesn’t \nquite solve our problem: the Internet \nSabbath (sometimes called a digital \ndetox). In its basic form, this ritual asks \nyou to put aside regular time—typically, \none day a week—where you refrain \nfrom network technology. In the same\n\nway that the Sabbath in the Hebrew \nBible induces a period of quiet and \nreflection well suited to appreciate God \nand his works, the Internet Sabbath is \nmeant to remind you of what you miss \nwhen you are glued to a screen.\nIt’s unclear who first introduced the \nInternet Sabbath concept, but credit for \npopularizing the idea often goes to the \njournalist William Powers, who \npromoted the practice in his 2010 \nreflection on technology and human \nhappiness, Hamlet’ s BlackBerry.  As \nPowers later summarizes in an \ninterview: “Do",

    "text": ", an important \ncorollary to this idea: Efforts to deepen \nyour focus will struggle if you don’t \nsimultaneously wean your mind from a \ndependence on distraction. Much in the \nsame way that athletes must take care of \ntheir bodies outside of their training \nsessions, you’ll struggle to achieve the \ndeepest levels of concentration if you \nspend the rest of your time fleeing the \nslightest hint of boredom\nWe can find evidence for this claim \nin the research of Clifford Nass, the late \nStanford communications professor who \nwas well known for his study of \nbehavior in the digital age. Among other\n\ninsights, Nass’s research revealed that \nconstant attention switching online has a \nlasting negative effect on your brain. \nHere’s Nass summarizing these findings \nin a 2010 interview with NPR’s Ira \nFlatow:\nSo we have scales that allow us  \nto divide up people into people  \nwho multitask all the time and  \npeople who rarely do, and the  \ndifferences are remarkable.  \nPeople who multitask all the  \ntime can’ t filter out irrelevancy.  \nThey can’ t manage a working  \nmemory. They ’ re chronically  \ndistracted. They initiate much\n\nlarger parts o f their brain that  \nare irrelevant to the task at  \nhand... they’ re pretty much  \nmental wrecks.\nAt this point Flatow asks Nass \nwhether the chronically distracted \nrecognize this rewiring of their brain:\nThe people we talk with  \ncontinually said, “ look, when I  \nreally have to concentrate, I  turn  \no ff everything and I  am laser-  \nfocused. ”  And unfortunately, \nthey’ve developed habits of mind \nthat make it impossible for them \nto be laser-focused. They’ re\n\nsuckers fo r irrelevancy. They  \njust can’ t keep on task.  \n[emphasis mine]\nOnce your brain has become \naccustomed to on-demand distraction, \nNass discovered, it’s hard to shake the \naddiction even when you want  to \nconcentrate. To put this more concretely: \nIf every moment of potential boredom in \nyour life— say, having to wait five \nminutes in line or sit alone in a \nrestaurant until a friend arrives—is \nrelieved with a quick glance at your \nsmartphone, then your brain has likely \nbeen rewired to a point where, like the \n“",

Among other\n\ninsights, Nass’s research revealed that \nconstant attention switching online has a \nlasting negative effect on your brain. \nHere’s Nass summarizing these findings \nin a 2010 interview with NPR’s Ira \nFlatow:\nSo we have scales that allow us  \nto divide up people into people  \nwho multitask all the time and  \npeople who rarely do, and the  \ndifferences are remarkable.  \nPeople who multitask all the  \ntime can’ t filter out irrelevancy.  \nThey can’ t manage a working  \nmemory.

Rule \n#2 will help you significantly improve \nthis limit. The strategies that follow are \nmotivated by the key idea that getting the \nmost out of your deep work habit \nrequires training, and as clarified \npreviously, this training must address \ntwo goals: improving your ability to \nconcentrate intensely and overcoming\n\nyour desire for distraction. These \nstrategies cover a variety of approaches, \nfrom quarantining distraction to \nmastering a special form of meditation, \nthat combine to provide a practical road \nmap for your journey from a mind \nwrecked by constant distraction and \nunfamiliar with concentration, to an \ninstrument that truly does deliver laser­\nlike focus.\nDon’t Take Breaks from \nDistraction. Instead Take \nBreaks from Focus.\nMany assume that they can switch\n\nbetween a state of distraction and one of \nconcentration as needed, but as I just \nargued, this assumption is optimistic: \nOnce you’re wired for distraction, you \ncrave it. Motivated by this reality, this \nstrategy is designed to help you rewire \nyour brain to a configuration better \nsuited to staying on task.\nBefore diving into the details, let’s \nstart by considering a popular suggestion \nfor distraction addiction that doesn’t \nquite solve our problem: the Internet \nSabbath (sometimes called a digital \ndetox). In its basic form, this ritual asks \nyou to put aside regular time—typically, \none day a week—where you refrain \nfrom network technology. In the same\n\nway that the Sabbath in the Hebrew \nBible induces a period of quiet and \nreflection well suited to appreciate God \nand his works, the Internet Sabbath is \nmeant to remind you of what you miss \nwhen you are glued to a screen.\nIt’s unclear who first introduced the \nInternet Sabbath concept, but credit for \npopularizing the idea often goes",

Rule \n#2 will help you significantly improve \nthis limit. The strategies that follow are \nmotivated by the key idea that getting the \nmost out of your deep work habit \nrequires training, and as clarified \npreviously, this training must address \ntwo goals: improving your ability to \nconcentrate intensely and overcoming\n\nyour desire for distraction. These \nstrategies cover a variety of approaches, \nfrom quarantining distraction to \nmastering a special form of meditation, \nthat combine to provide a practical road \nmap for your journey from a mind \nwrecked by constant distraction and \nunfamiliar with concentration, to an \ninstrument that truly does",

Instead Take \nBreaks from Focus.\nMany assume that they can switch\n\nbetween a state of distraction and one of \nconcentration as needed, but as I just \nargued, this assumption is optimistic: \nOnce you’re wired for distraction, you \ncrave it. Motivated by this reality, this \nstrategy is designed to help you rewire \nyour brain to a configuration better \nsuited to staying on task.\nBefore diving into the details, let’s \nstart by considering a popular suggestion \nfor distraction addiction that doesn’t \nquite solve our problem: the Internet \nSabbath (sometimes called a digital \ndetox). In its basic form, this ritual asks \nyou to put aside regular time—typically, \none day a week—where you refrain \nfrom network technology. In the same\n\nway that the Sabbath in the Hebrew \nBible induces a period of quiet and \nreflection well suited to appreciate God",

    "text": " to the \njournalist William Powers, who \npromoted the practice in his 2010 \nreflection on technology and human \nhappiness, Hamlet’ s BlackBerry.  As \nPowers later summarizes in an \ninterview: “Do what Thoreau did, which \nis learn to have a little disconnectedness \nwithin the connected world— don’t run\n\naway.”\nA lot of advice for the problem of \ndistraction follows this general template \nof finding occasional time to get away \nfrom the clatter. Some put aside one or \ntwo months a year to escape these \ntethers, others follow Powers’s one-day- \na-week advice, while others put aside an \nhour or two every day for the same \npurpose. All forms of this advice \nprovide some benefit, but once we see \nthe distraction problem in terms of brain \nwiring, it becomes clear that an Internet \nSabbath cannot by itself cure a \ndistracted brain. If you eat healthy just \none day a week, you’re unlikely to lose \nweight, as the majority of your time is\n\nstill spent gorging. Similarly, if you \nspend just one day a week resisting \ndistraction, you’re unlikely to diminish \nyour brain’s craving for these stimuli, as \nmost of your time is still spent giving in \nto it.\nI propose an alternative to the \nInternet Sabbath. Instead of scheduling \nthe occasional break from distraction  so \nyou can focus, you should instead \nschedule the occasional break from  \nfocus  to give in to distraction. To make \nthis suggestion more concrete, let’s make \nthe simplifying assumption that Internet \nuse is synonymous with seeking\ndistracting stimuli. (You can, of course, \nuse the Internet in a way that’s focused\n\nand deep, but for a distraction addict, \nthis is a difficult task.) Similarly, let’s \nconsider working in the absence of the \nInternet to be synonymous with more \nfocused work. (You can, of course, find \nways to be distracted without a network \nconnection, but these tend to be easier to \nresist.)\nWith these rough categorizations \nestablished, the strategy works as \nfollows: Schedule in advance when \nyou’ll use the Internet, and then avoid it \naltogether outside these times. I suggest \nthat you keep a notepad near your \ncomputer at work. On this pad, record \nthe next time you’re allowed to use the \nInternet. Until you arrive at that time,\n\nabsolutely no network connectivity is \nallowed—no matter how tempting.\nThe idea motivating this strategy is \nthat the use of a distracting service does \nnot, by itself, reduce your brain’s ability \nto focus. It’s instead the constant \nswitching  from low-stimuli/high-value \nactivities to high-stimuli/low-value \nactivities, at the slightest hint of \nboredom or cognitive challenge, that \nteaches your mind to never tolerate an \nabsence of novelty. This constant \nswitching can be understood analogously \nas weakening the mental muscles \nresponsible for organizing the many \nsources vying for your attention. By \nsegregating Internet use (and therefore\n\nsegregating distractions) you’re \nminimizing the number of times you give \nin to distraction, and by doing so you let \nthese attention-selecting muscles \nstrengthen.\nFor example, if you’ve scheduled \nyour next Internet block thirty minutes \nfrom the current moment, and you’re \nbeginning to feel bored and crave \ndistraction, the next thirty minutes of \nresistance become a session of \nconcentration calisthenics. A full day of \nscheduled distraction therefore becomes \na full day of similar mental training.\nWhile the basic idea behind this \nstrategy is straightforward, putting it into \npractice can be tricky. To help you\n\nsucceed, here are three important points \nto consider.\nPoint #1 : This strategy works  \neven if your job requires lots  \nof Internet use and/or prompt  \ne-mail replies.\nIf you’re required to spend hours every \nday online or answer e-mails quickly, \nthat’s fine: This simply means that your \nInternet blocks  will be more numerous \nthan those of someone whose job \nrequires less connectivity. The total \nnumber or duration of your Internet \nblocks doesn’t matter nearly as much as\n\nmaking sure that the integrity of your \noffline blocks  remains intact.\nImagine, for example, that over a \ntwo-hour period between meetings, you \nmust schedule an e-mail check every \nfifteen minutes. Further imagine that \nthese checks require, on average, five \nminutes. It’s sufficient, therefore, to \nschedule an Internet block every fifteen \nminutes through this two-hour stretch, \nwith the rest of the time dedicated to \noffline blocks. In this example, you’ll \nend up spending around ninety minutes \nout of this two-hour period in a state \nwhere you",

    "text": " to the \njournalist William Powers, who \npromoted the practice in his 2010 \nreflection on technology and human \nhappiness, Hamlet’ s BlackBerry.  As \nPowers later summarizes in an \ninterview: “Do what Thoreau did, which \nis learn to have a little disconnectedness \nwithin the connected world— don’t run\n\naway.”\nA lot of advice for the problem of \ndistraction follows this general template \nof finding occasional time to get away \nfrom the clatter. Some put aside one or \ntwo months a year to escape these \ntethers, others follow Powers’s one-day- \na-week advice, while others put aside an \nhour or two every day for the same \npurpose. All forms of this advice \nprovide some benefit, but once we see \nthe distraction problem in terms of brain \nwiring, it becomes clear that an Internet \nSabbath cannot by itself cure a \ndistracted brain. If you eat healthy just \none day a week, you’re unlikely to lose \nweight, as the majority of your time is\n\nstill spent gorging. Similarly, if you \nspend just one day a week resisting \ndistraction, you’re unlikely to diminish \nyour brain’s craving for these stimuli, as \nmost of your time is still spent giving in \nto it.\nI propose an alternative to the \nInternet Sabbath. Instead of scheduling \nthe occasional break from distraction  so \nyou can focus, you should instead \nschedule the occasional break from  \nfocus  to give in to distraction. To make \nthis suggestion more concrete, let’s make \nthe simplifying assumption that Internet \nuse is synonymous with seeking\ndistracting stimuli. (You can, of course, \nuse the Internet in a way that’s focused\n\nand deep, but for a distraction addict, \nthis is a difficult task.) Similarly, let’s \nconsider working in the absence of the \nInternet to be synonymous with more \nfocused work. (You can, of course, find \nways to be distracted without a network \nconnection, but these tend to be easier to \nresist.)\nWith these rough categorizations \nestablished, the strategy works as \nfollows: Schedule in advance when \nyou’ll use the Internet, and then avoid it \naltogether outside these times. I suggest \nthat you keep a notepad near your \ncomputer at work. On this pad, record \nthe next time you’re allowed to use the \n",

    "text": " to the \njournalist William Powers, who \npromoted the practice in his 2010 \nreflection on technology and human \nhappiness, Hamlet’ s BlackBerry.  As \nPowers later summarizes in an \ninterview: “Do what Thoreau did, which \nis learn to have a little disconnectedness \nwithin the connected world— don’t run\n\naway.”\nA lot of advice for the problem of \ndistraction follows this general template \nof finding occasional time to get away \nfrom the clatter. Some put aside one or \ntwo months a year to escape these \ntethers, others follow Powers’s one-day- \na-week advice, while others put aside an \nhour or two every day for the same \npurpose. All forms of this advice \nprovide some benefit, but once we see \nthe distraction problem in terms of brain \nwiring, it becomes clear that an Internet \nSabbath cannot by itself cure a \ndistracted brain. If you eat healthy just \none day a week, you’re unlikely to lose \nweight, as the majority of your time is\n\nstill spent gorging. Similarly, if you \nspend just one day a week resisting \ndistraction, you’re unlikely to diminish",

Similarly, if you \nspend just one day a week resisting \ndistraction, you’re unlikely to diminish \nyour brain’s craving for these stimuli, as \nmost of your time is still spent giving in \nto it.\nI propose an alternative to the \nInternet Sabbath. Instead of scheduling \nthe occasional break from distraction  so \nyou can focus, you should instead \nschedule the occasional break from  \nfocus  to give in to distraction. To make \nthis suggestion more concrete, let’s make \nthe simplifying assumption that Internet \nuse is synonymous with seeking\ndistracting stimuli. (You can, of course, \nuse the Internet in a way that’s focused\n\nand deep, but for a distraction addict, \nthis is a difficult task.) Similarly, let’s \nconsider working in the absence of the \nInternet to be synonymous with more \nfocused work. (You can, of course, find \nways to be distracted without a network \nconnection, but these tend to be easier to \nresist.)\nWith these rough categorizations \nestablished, the strategy works as \nfollows: Schedule in advance when",

    "text": " \nyou’ll use the Internet, and then avoid it \naltogether outside these times. I suggest \nthat you keep a notepad near your \ncomputer at work. On this pad, record \nthe next time you’re allowed to use the \nInternet. Until you arrive at that time,\n\nabsolutely no network connectivity is \nallowed—no matter how tempting.\nThe idea motivating this strategy is \nthat the use of a distracting service does \nnot, by itself, reduce your brain’s ability \nto focus. It’s instead the constant \nswitching  from low-stimuli/high-value \nactivities to high-stimuli/low-value \nactivities, at the slightest hint of \nboredom or cognitive challenge, that \nteaches your mind to never tolerate an \nabsence of novelty. This constant \nswitching can be understood analogously \nas weakening the mental muscles \nresponsible for organizing the many \nsources vying for your attention. By \nsegregating Internet use (and therefore\n\nsegregating distractions) you’re \nminimizing the number of times you give \nin to distraction, and by doing so you let \nthese attention-selecting muscles \nstrengthen.\nFor example, if you’ve scheduled \nyour next Internet block thirty minutes \nfrom the current moment, and you’re \nbeginning to feel bored and crave \ndistraction, the next thirty minutes of \nresistance become a session of \nconcentration calisthenics. A full day of \nscheduled distraction therefore becomes \na full day of similar mental training.\nWhile the basic idea behind this \nstrategy is straightforward, putting it into \npractice can be tricky. To help you\n\nsucceed, here are three important points \nto consider.\nPoint #1 : This strategy works  \neven if your job requires lots  \nof Internet use and/or prompt  \ne-mail replies.\nIf you’re required to spend hours every \nday online or answer e-mails quickly, \nthat’s fine: This simply means that your \nInternet blocks  will be more numerous \nthan those of someone whose job \nrequires less connectivity. The total \nnumber or duration of your Internet \nblocks doesn’t matter nearly as much as\n\nmaking sure that the integrity of your \noffline blocks  remains intact.\nImagine, for example, that over a \ntwo-hour period between meetings, you \nmust schedule an e-mail check every \nfifteen minutes. Further imagine that \nthese checks require, on average, five \nminutes. It’s sufficient, therefore, to \nschedule an Internet",

On this pad, record \nthe next time you’re allowed to use the \nInternet. Until you arrive at that time,\n\nabsolutely no network connectivity is \nallowed—no matter how tempting.\nThe idea motivating this strategy is \nthat the use of a distracting service does \nnot, by itself, reduce your brain’s ability \nto focus. It’s instead the constant \nswitching  from low-stimuli/high-value \nactivities to high-stimuli/low-value \nactivities, at the slightest hint of \nboredom or cognitive challenge, that \nteaches your mind to never tolerate an \nabsence of novelty. This constant \nswitching can be understood analogously \nas weakening the mental muscles \nresponsible for organizing the many \nsources vying for your attention. By \nsegregating Internet use (and therefore\n\nsegregating distractions) you’re \nminimizing the number of times you give \nin to distraction, and by doing so you let \nthese attention-selecting muscles \nstrengthen.\nFor example, if you’ve scheduled \nyour next Internet block thirty minutes \n",

A full day of \nscheduled distraction therefore becomes \na full day of similar mental training.\nWhile the basic idea behind this \nstrategy is straightforward, putting it into \npractice can be tricky.

The total \nnumber or duration of your Internet \nblocks doesn’t matter nearly as much as\n\nmaking sure that the integrity of your \noffline blocks  remains intact.\nImagine, for example, that",

    "text": " block every fifteen \nminutes through this two-hour stretch, \nwith the rest of the time dedicated to \noffline blocks. In this example, you’ll \nend up spending around ninety minutes \nout of this two-hour period in a state \nwhere you’re offline and actively \nresisting distraction. This works out to \nbe a large amount of concentration\n\ntraining that’s achieved without \nrequiring you to sacrifice too much \nconnectivity.\nPoint #2 : Regardless of how  \nyou schedule your Internet  \nblocks, you must keep the time  \noutside these blocks  \nabsolutely free from Internet  \nuse.\nThis objective is easy to state in \nprinciple but quickly becomes tricky in \nthe messy reality of the standard \nworkday. An inevitable issue you’ll face\n\nwhen executing this strategy is realizing \nearly on in an offline block that there’s \nsome crucial piece of information online \nthat you need to retrieve to continue \nmaking progress on your current task. If \nyour next Internet block doesn’t start for \na while, you might end up stuck. The \ntemptation in this situation is to quickly \ngive in, look up the information, then \nreturn to your offline block. You must  \nresist this temptation!  The Internet is \nseductive: You may think you’re just \nretrieving a single key e-mail from your \ninbox, but you’ll find it hard to not \nglance at the other “urgent” messages \nthat have recently arrived. It doesn’t take \nmany of these exceptions before your\n\nmind begins to treat the barrier between \nInternet and offline blocks as permeable \n—diminishing the benefits of this \nstrategy.\nIt’s crucial in this situation, therefore, \nthat you don’t immediately abandon an \noffline block, even when stuck. If it’s \npossible, switch to another offline \nactivity for the remainder of the current \nblock (or perhaps even fill in this time \nrelaxing). If this is infeasible—perhaps \nyou need to get the current offline \nactivity done promptly—then the correct \nresponse is to change  your schedule so \nthat your next Internet block begins \nsooner. The key in making this change, \nhowever, is to not schedule the next\n\nInternet block to occur immediately. \nInstead, enforce at least a five-minute \ngap between the current moment and the \nnext time you can go online. This gap is \nminor, so it won’t excessively impede \nyour progress, but from a behavioralist \nperspective, it’s substantial because it \nseparates the sensation of wanting to go \nonline from the reward of actually doing \nso.\nPoint #3 : Scheduling Internet  \nuse at home as well as at work  \ncan further improve your  \nconcentration training.\n\nIf you find yourself glued to a \nsmartphone or laptop throughout your \nevenings and weekends, then it’s likely \nthat your behavior outside of work is \nundoing many of your attempts during the \nworkday to rewire your brain (which \nmakes little distinction between the two \nsettings). In this case, I would suggest \nthat you maintain the strategy of \nscheduling Internet use even after the \nworkday is over.\nTo simplify matters, when scheduling \nInternet use after work, you can allow \ntime-sensitive communication into your \noffline blocks (e.g., texting with a friend \nto agree on where you’ll meet for \ndinner), as well as time-sensitive\n\ninformation retrieval (e.g., looking up \nthe location of the restaurant on your \nphone). Outside of these pragmatic \nexceptions, however, when in an offline \nblock, put your phone away, ignore texts, \nand refrain from Internet usage. As in the \nworkplace variation of this strategy, if \nthe Internet plays a large and important \nrole in your evening entertainment, that’s \nfine: Schedule lots of long Internet \nblocks. The key here isn’t to avoid or \neven to reduce the total amount of time \nyou spend engaging in distracting \nbehavior, but is instead to give yourself \nplenty of opportunities throughout your \nevening to resist  switching to these \ndistractions at the slightest hint of\n\nboredom.\nOne place where this strategy \nbecomes particularly difficult outside \nwork is when you’re forced to wait (for \nexample, standing in line at a store). It’s \ncrucial in these situations that if you’re \nin an offline block, you simply gird \nyourself for the temporary boredom, and \nfight through it with only the company of \nyour thoughts. To simply wait and be \nbored has become a novel experience in \nmodern life, but from the perspective of \nconcentration training, it’s incredibly \nvaluable.\nTo summarize, to succeed with deep \nwork you must rewire your brain to be\n\ncomfortable resisting distracting stimuli. \nThis doesn’t mean that you have to \neliminate distracting behaviors; it’s \nsufficient that you instead eliminate the \nability of such",

    "text": " block every fifteen \nminutes through this two-hour stretch, \nwith the rest of the time dedicated to \noffline blocks. In this example, you’ll \nend up spending around ninety minutes \nout of this two-hour period in a state \nwhere you’re offline and actively \nresisting distraction. This works out to \nbe a large amount of concentration\n\ntraining that’s achieved without \nrequiring you to sacrifice too much \nconnectivity.\nPoint #2 : Regardless of how  \nyou schedule your Internet  \nblocks, you must keep the time  \noutside these blocks  \nabsolutely free from Internet  \nuse.\nThis objective is easy to state in \nprinciple but quickly becomes tricky in \nthe messy reality of the standard \nworkday. An inevitable issue you’ll face\n\nwhen executing this strategy is realizing \nearly on in an offline block that there’s \nsome crucial piece of information online \nthat you need to retrieve to continue \nmaking progress on your current task. If \nyour next Internet block doesn’t start for \na while, you might end up stuck. The \ntemptation in this situation is to quickly \ngive in, look up the information, then \nreturn to your offline block. You must  \nresist this temptation!  The Internet is \nseductive: You may think you’re just \nretrieving a single key e-mail from your \ninbox, but you’ll find it hard to not \nglance at the other “urgent” messages \nthat have recently arrived. It doesn’t take \nmany of these exceptions before your\n\nmind begins to treat the barrier between \nInternet and offline blocks as permeable \n—diminishing the benefits of this \nstrategy.\nIt’s crucial in this situation, therefore, \nthat you don’t immediately abandon an \noffline block, even when stuck. If it’s \npossible, switch to another offline \nactivity for the remainder of the current \nblock (or perhaps even fill in this time \nrelaxing). If this is infeasible—perhaps \nyou need to get the current offline \nactivity done promptly—then the correct \nresponse is to change  your schedule so \nthat your next Internet block begins \nsooner. The key in making this change, \nhowever, is to not schedule the next\n\nInternet block to occur immediately. \nInstead, enforce at least a five-minute \ngap between the current moment and the \nnext time you can go online. This gap is \nminor, so it won’t excessively impede \nyour progress, but from a behavioralist \n",

    "text": ", you might end up stuck. The \ntemptation in this situation is to quickly \ngive in, look up the information, then \nreturn to your offline block. You must  \nresist this temptation!  The Internet is \nseductive: You may think you’re just \nretrieving a single key e-mail from your \ninbox, but you’ll find it hard to not \nglance at the other “urgent” messages \nthat have recently arrived. It doesn’t take \nmany of these exceptions before your\n\nmind begins to treat the barrier between \nInternet and offline blocks as permeable \n—diminishing the benefits of this \nstrategy.\nIt’s crucial in this situation, therefore, \nthat you don’t immediately abandon an \noffline block, even when stuck. If it’s \npossible, switch to another offline \nactivity for the remainder of the current \nblock (or perhaps even fill in this time \nrelaxing). If this is infeasible—perhaps \nyou need to get the current offline \nactivity done promptly—then the correct \nresponse is to change  your schedule so \nthat your next Internet block begins \nsooner. The key in making this change, \nhowever, is to not schedule the next\n\nInternet block to occur",

    "text": " immediately. \nInstead, enforce at least a five-minute \ngap between the current moment and the \nnext time you can go online. This gap is \nminor, so it won’t excessively impede \nyour progress, but from a behavioralist \nperspective, it’s substantial because it \nseparates the sensation of wanting to go \nonline from the reward of actually doing \nso.\nPoint #3 : Scheduling Internet  \nuse at home as well as at work  \ncan further improve your  \nconcentration training.\n\nIf you find yourself glued to a \nsmartphone or laptop throughout your \nevenings and weekends, then it’s likely \nthat your behavior outside of work is \nundoing many of your attempts during the \nworkday to rewire your brain (which \nmakes little distinction between the two \nsettings). In this case, I would suggest \nthat you maintain the strategy of \nscheduling Internet use even after the \nworkday is over.\nTo simplify matters, when scheduling \nInternet use after work, you can allow \ntime-sensitive communication into your \noffline blocks (e.g., texting with a friend \nto agree on where you’ll meet for \ndinner), as well as time-sensitive\n\ninformation retrieval (e.g., looking up \nthe location of the restaurant on your \nphone). Outside of these pragmatic \nexceptions, however, when in an offline \nblock, put your phone away, ignore texts, \nand refrain from Internet usage. As in the \nworkplace variation of this strategy, if \nthe Internet plays a large and important \nrole in your evening entertainment, that’s \nfine: Schedule lots of long Internet \nblocks. The key here isn’t to avoid or \neven to reduce the total amount of time \nyou spend engaging in distracting \nbehavior, but is instead to give yourself \nplenty of opportunities throughout your \nevening to resist  switching to these \ndistractions at the slightest hint of\n\nboredom.\nOne place where this strategy \nbecomes particularly difficult outside \nwork is when you’re forced to wait (for \nexample, standing in line at a store). It’s \ncrucial in these situations that if you’re \nin an offline block, you simply gird \nyourself for the temporary boredom, and \nfight through it with only the company of \nyour thoughts. To simply wait and be \nbored has become a novel experience in \nmodern life, but from the perspective of \nconcentration training, it’s incredibly \nvaluable.\nTo summarize,",

    "text": " to succeed with deep \nwork you must rewire your brain to be\n\ncomfortable resisting distracting stimuli. \nThis doesn’t mean that you have to \neliminate distracting behaviors; it’s \nsufficient that you instead eliminate the \nability of such behaviors to hijack your \nattention. The simple strategy proposed \nhere of scheduling Internet blocks goes a \nlong way toward helping you regain this \nattention autonomy.\nWork Like Teddy Roosevelt\nIf you attended Harvard College during \nthe 1876-1877 school year, you \nwould’ve likely noticed a wiry, mutton- \nchopped, brash, and impossibly\n\nenergetic freshman named Theodore \nRoosevelt. If you then proceeded to \nbefriend this young man, you would’ve \nsoon noticed a paradox.\nOn the one hand, his attention might \nappear to be hopelessly scattered, \nspread over what one classmate called \nan “amazing array of interests”— a list \nthat biographer Edmund Morris catalogs \nto contain boxing, wrestling, body \nbuilding, dance lessons, poetry readings, \nand the continuation of a lifelong \nobsession with naturalism (Roosevelt’s \nlandlord on Winthrop Street was not \npleased with her young tenant’s tendency \nto dissect and stuff specimens in his \nrented room). This latter interest\n\ndeveloped to the point that Roosevelt \npublished his first book, The Summer  \nBirds o f the Adirondacks , in the summer \nafter his freshman year. It was well \nreceived in the Bulletin o f the Nuttall  \nOrnithological Club — a publication, \nneedless to say, which takes bird books \nquite seriously—and was good enough \nto lead Morris to assess Roosevelt, at \nthis young age, to be “one of the most \nknowledgeable young naturalists in the \nUnited States.”\nTo support this extracurricular \nexuberance Roosevelt had to severely \nrestrict the time left available for what \nshould have been his primary focus: his \nstudies at Harvard. Morris used\n\nRoosevelt’s diary and letters from this \nperiod to estimate that the future \npresident was spending no more than a \nquarter of the typical day studying. One \nmight expect therefore that Roosevelt’s \ngrades would crater. But they didn’t. He \nwasn’t the top student in his class, but he \ncertainly didn’t struggle either: In his \nfreshman year he earned honor grades in \nfive out of his seven courses. The \nexplanation for this Roosevelt paradox \nturns out to be his unique approach to \ntackling this schoolwork. Roosevelt \nwould begin his scheduling by \nconsidering the eight hours from eight \nthirty a.m to four thirty p.m. He would \nthen remove the time spent in recitation\n\nand classes, his athletic training (which \nwas once a day), and lunch. The \nfragments that remained were then \nconsidered time dedicated exclusively to \nstudying. As noted, these fragments \ndidn’t usually add up to a large number \nof total hours, but he would get the most \nout of them by working only on \nschoolwork during these periods, and \ndoing so with a blistering intensity.  \n“The amount of time he spent at his desk \nwas comparatively small,” explained \nMorris, “but his concentration was so \nintense, and his reading so rapid, that he \ncould afford more time off [from \nschoolwork] than most.”\n\nThis strategy asks you to inject the \noccasional dash of Rooseveltian \nintensity into your own workday. In \nparticular, identify a deep task (that is, \nsomething that requires deep work to \ncomplete) that’s high on your priority \nlist. Estimate how long you’d normally \nput aside for an obligation of this type, \nthen give yourself a hard deadline that \ndrastically reduces  this time. If \npossible, commit publicly to the \ndeadline— for example, by telling the \nperson expecting the finished project \nwhen they should expect it. If this isn’t \npossible (or if it puts your job in \njeopardy), then motivate yourself by \nsetting a countdown timer on your phone\n\nand propping it up where you can’t \navoid seeing it as you work.\nAt this point, there should be only \none possible way to get the deep task \ndone in time: working with great\nintensity —no e-mail breaks, no \ndaydreaming, no Facebook browsing, no \nrepeated trips to the coffee machine. \nLike Roosevelt at Harvard, attack the \ntask with every free neuron until it gives \nway under your unwavering barrage of \nconcentration.\nTry this experiment no more than \nonce a week at first—giving your brain \npractice with intensity, but also giving it \n(and your stress levels) time to rest in \nbetween. Once you feel confident in your\n\nability to trade concentration for \ncompletion time,",

    "text": " to succeed with deep \nwork you must rewire your brain to be\n\ncomfortable resisting distracting stimuli. \nThis doesn’t mean that you have to \neliminate distracting behaviors; it’s \nsufficient that you instead eliminate the \nability of such behaviors to hijack your \nattention. The simple strategy proposed \nhere of scheduling Internet blocks goes a \nlong way toward helping you regain this \nattention autonomy.\nWork Like Teddy Roosevelt\nIf you attended Harvard College during \nthe 1876-1877 school year, you \nwould’ve likely noticed a wiry, mutton- \nchopped, brash, and impossibly\n\nenergetic freshman named Theodore \nRoosevelt. If you then proceeded to \nbefriend this young man, you would’ve \nsoon noticed a paradox.\nOn the one hand, his attention might \nappear to be hopelessly scattered, \nspread over what one classmate called \nan “amazing array of interests”— a list \nthat biographer Edmund Morris catalogs \nto contain boxing, wrestling, body \nbuilding, dance lessons, poetry readings, \nand the continuation of a lifelong \nobsession with naturalism (Roosevelt’s \nlandlord on Winthrop Street was not \npleased with her young tenant’s tendency \nto dissect and stuff specimens in his \nrented room). This latter interest\n\ndeveloped to the point that Roosevelt \npublished his first book, The Summer  \nBirds o f the Adirondacks , in the summer \nafter his freshman year. It was well \nreceived in the Bulletin o f the Nuttall  \nOrnithological Club — a publication, \nneedless to say, which takes bird books \nquite seriously—and was good enough \nto lead Morris to assess Roosevelt, at \nthis young age, to be “one of the most \nknowledgeable young naturalists in the \nUnited States.”\nTo support this extracurricular \nexuberance Roosevelt had to severely \nrestrict the time left available for what \nshould have been his primary focus: his \nstudies at Harvard. Morris used\n\nRoosevelt’s diary and letters from this \nperiod to estimate that the future \npresident was spending no more than a \nquarter of the typical day studying. One \nmight expect therefore that Roosevelt’s \ngrades would crater. But they didn’t. He \nwasn’t the top student in his class, but he \ncertainly didn’t struggle either: In his \nfreshman year he earned honor grades in \nfive out of his seven",

He \nwasn’t the top student in his class, but he \ncertainly didn’t struggle either: In his \nfreshman year he earned honor grades in \nfive out of his seven courses. The \nexplanation for this Roosevelt paradox \nturns out to be his unique approach to \ntackling this schoolwork. Roosevelt \nwould begin his scheduling by \nconsidering the eight hours from eight \nthirty a.m to four thirty p.m. He would \nthen remove the time spent in recitation\n\nand classes, his athletic training (which \nwas once a day), and lunch. The \nfragments that remained were then \nconsidered time dedicated exclusively to \nstudying. As noted, these fragments \ndidn’t usually add up to a large number \nof total hours, but he would get the most \nout of them by working only on \nschoolwork during these periods, and \ndoing so with a blistering intensity.  \n“The amount of time he spent at his desk \nwas comparatively small,” explained \nMorris, “but his concentration was so \nintense, and his reading so rapid, that he \ncould afford more time off [from \nschoolwork] than most.”\n\nThis strategy asks you to inject the \noccasional dash of Rooseveltian \nintensity into your own workday. In \nparticular, identify a deep task (that is, \nsomething that requires deep work to \ncomplete) that’s high on your priority \nlist. Estimate how long you’d normally \nput aside for an obligation of this type, \nthen give yourself a hard deadline that \ndrastically reduces  this time. If \npossible, commit publicly to the \ndeadline— for example, by telling the \nperson expecting the finished project \nwhen they should expect it. If this isn’t \npossible (or if it puts your job in \njeopardy), then motivate yourself by \nsetting a countdown timer on your phone\n\nand propping it up where you can’t \navoid seeing it as you work.\nAt this point, there should be only \none possible way to get the deep task \ndone in time: working with great\nintensity —no e-mail breaks, no \ndaydreaming, no Facebook browsing, no \nrepeated trips to the coffee machine. \nLike Roosevelt at Harvard, attack the \ntask with every free neuron until it gives \nway under your unwavering barrage of \nconcentration.\nTry this experiment no more",

He \nwasn’t the top student in his class, but he \ncertainly didn’t struggle either: In his \nfreshman year he earned honor grades in \nfive out of his seven courses. The \nexplanation for this Roosevelt paradox \nturns out to be his unique approach to \ntackling this schoolwork. Roosevelt \nwould begin his scheduling by \nconsidering the eight hours from eight \nthirty a.m to four thirty p.m. He would \nthen remove the time spent in recitation\n\nand classes, his athletic training (which \nwas once a day), and lunch. The \nfragments that remained were then \nconsidered time dedicated exclusively to \nstudying. As noted, these fragments \ndidn’t usually add up to a large number \nof total hours, but he would get the most \nout of them by working only on \nschoolwork during these periods, and \ndoing so with a blistering intensity.  \n“The amount of time he spent at his desk \nwas comparatively small,” explained \nMorris, “but his concentration was so \nintense, and his reading so rapid, that he \ncould afford more time off [from \nschoolwork] than most.”\n\n",

    "text": " of time he spent at his desk \nwas comparatively small,” explained \nMorris, “but his concentration was so \nintense, and his reading so rapid, that he \ncould afford more time off [from \nschoolwork] than most.”\n\nThis strategy asks you to inject the \noccasional dash of Rooseveltian \nintensity into your own workday. In \nparticular, identify a deep task (that is, \nsomething that requires deep work to \ncomplete) that’s high on your priority \nlist. Estimate how long you’d normally \nput aside for an obligation of this type, \nthen give yourself a hard deadline that \ndrastically reduces  this time. If \npossible, commit publicly to the \ndeadline— for example, by telling the \nperson expecting the finished project \nwhen they should expect it. If this isn’t \npossible (or if it puts your job in \njeopardy), then motivate yourself by \nsetting a countdown timer on your phone\n\nand propping it up where you can’t \navoid seeing it as you work.\nAt this point, there should be only \none possible way to get the deep task \ndone in time: working with great\nintensity —no e-mail breaks, no \ndaydreaming",

    "text": " than \nonce a week at first—giving your brain \npractice with intensity, but also giving it \n(and your stress levels) time to rest in \nbetween. Once you feel confident in your\n\nability to trade concentration for \ncompletion time, increase the frequency \nof these Roosevelt dashes. Remember, \nhowever, to always keep your self- \nimposed deadlines right at the edge of \nfeasibility. You should be able to \nconsistently beat the buzzer (or at least \nbe close), but to do so should require \nteeth-gritting concentration.\nThe main motivation for this strategy \nis straightforward. Deep work requires \nlevels of concentration well beyond \nwhere most knowledge workers are \ncomfortable. Roosevelt dashes leverage \nartificial deadlines to help you \nsystematically increase the level you can \nregularly achieve—providing, in some\n\nsense, interval training for the attention \ncenters of your brain. An additional \nbenefit is that these dashes are \nincompatible with distraction (there’s no \nway you can give in to distraction and \nstill make your deadlines). Therefore, \nevery completed dash provides a \nsession in which you’re potentially \nbored, and really want to seek more \nnovel stimuli—but you resist. As argued \nin the previous strategy, the more you \npractice resisting such urges, the easier \nsuch resistance becomes.\nAfter a few months of deploying this \nstrategy, your understanding o f what it \nmeans to focus will likely be \ntransformed as you reach levels of\n\nintensity stronger than anything you’ve \nexperienced before. And if you’re \nanything like a young Roosevelt, you can \nthen repurpose the extra free time it \ngenerates toward the finer pleasures in \nlife, like trying to impress the always- \ndiscerning members of the Nuttall \nOrnithological Club.\nMeditate Productively\nDuring the two years I spent as a \npostdoctoral associate at MIT, my wife \nand I lived in a small but charming \napartment on Pinckney Street, in historic \nBeacon Hill. Though I lived in Boston\n\nand worked in Cambridge, the two \nlocations were close— only a mile apart, \nsitting on opposite banks of the Charles \nRiver. Intent on staying fit, even during \nthe long and dark New England winter, I \ndecided to take advantage of this \nproximity by traveling between home \nand work, to the greatest extent possible, \non foot.\nMy routine had me walk to campus in \nthe morning, crossing the Longfellow \nBridge in all weather (the city, it turns \nout to my dismay, is often slow to shovel \nthe pedestrian path after snowstorms). \nAround lunch, I would change into \nrunning gear and run back home on a \nlonger path that followed the banks of\n\nthe Charles, crossing at the \nMassachusetts Avenue Bridge. After a \nquick lunch and shower at home, I would \ntypically take the subway across the \nriver on the way back to campus (saving, \nperhaps, a third of a mile on the trek), \nand then walk home when the workday \nwas done. In other words, I spent a lot  \nof time on my feet during this period. It \nwas this reality that led me to develop \nthe practice that I’ll now suggest you \nadopt in your own deep work training: \nproductive meditation.\nThe goal of productive meditation is \nto take a period in which you’re \noccupied physically but not mentally— \nwalking, jogging, driving, showering—\n\nand focus your attention on a single \nwell-defined professional problem \nDepending on your profession, this \nproblem might be outlining an article, \nwriting a talk, making progress on a \nproof, or attempting to sharpen a \nbusiness strategy. As in mindfulness \nmeditation, you must continue to bring \nyour attention back to the problem at \nhand when it wanders or stalls.\nI used to practice productive \nmeditation in at least one of my daily \ncross-river treks while living in Boston, \nand as I improved, so did my results. I \nended up, for example, working out the \nchapter outlines for a significant portion \nof my last book while on foot, and made\n\nprogress on many knotty technical \nproblems in my academic research.\nI suggest that you adopt a productive \nmeditation practice in your own life. \nYou don’t necessarily need a serious \nsession every day, but your goal should \nbe to participate in at least two or three \nsuch sessions in a typical week. \nFortunately, finding time for this strategy \nis easy, as it takes advantage of periods \nthat would otherwise be wasted (such as \nwalking the dog or commuting to work), \nand if done right, can actually increase \nyour professional productivity instead of \ntaking time away from your work. In \nfact, you might even consider scheduling \na walk during your workday specifically\n\nfor the purpose of applying",

    "text": " than \nonce a week at first—giving your brain \npractice with intensity, but also giving it \n(and your stress levels) time to rest in \nbetween. Once you feel confident in your\n\nability to trade concentration for \ncompletion time, increase the frequency \nof these Roosevelt dashes. Remember, \nhowever, to always keep your self- \nimposed deadlines right at the edge of \nfeasibility. You should be able to \nconsistently beat the buzzer (or at least \nbe close), but to do so should require \nteeth-gritting concentration.\nThe main motivation for this strategy \nis straightforward. Deep work requires \nlevels of concentration well beyond \nwhere most knowledge workers are \ncomfortable. Roosevelt dashes leverage \nartificial deadlines to help you \nsystematically increase the level you can \nregularly achieve—providing, in some\n\nsense, interval training for the attention \ncenters of your brain. An additional \nbenefit is that these dashes are \nincompatible with distraction (there’s no \nway you can give in to distraction and \nstill make your deadlines). Therefore, \nevery completed dash provides a \nsession in which you’re potentially \nbored, and really want to seek more \nnovel stimuli—but you resist. As argued \nin the previous strategy, the more you \npractice resisting such urges, the easier \nsuch resistance becomes.\nAfter a few months of deploying this \nstrategy, your understanding o f what it \nmeans to focus will likely be \ntransformed as you reach levels of\n\nintensity stronger than anything you’ve \nexperienced before. And if you’re \nanything like a young Roosevelt, you can \nthen repurpose the extra free time it \ngenerates toward the finer pleasures in \nlife, like trying to impress the always- \ndiscerning members of the Nuttall \nOrnithological Club.\nMeditate Productively\nDuring the two years I spent as a \npostdoctoral associate at MIT, my wife \nand I lived in a small but charming \napartment on Pinckney Street, in historic \nBeacon Hill. Though I lived in Boston\n\nand worked in Cambridge, the two \nlocations were close— only a mile apart, \nsitting on opposite banks of the Charles \nRiver. Intent on staying fit, even during \nthe long and dark New England winter, I \ndecided to take advantage of this \nproximity by traveling between home \nand work, to the greatest extent possible, \non foot.\nMy",

    "text": " than \nonce a week at first—giving your brain \npractice with intensity, but also giving it \n(and your stress levels) time to rest in \nbetween. Once you feel confident in your\n\nability to trade concentration for \ncompletion time, increase the frequency \nof these Roosevelt dashes. Remember, \nhowever, to always keep your self- \nimposed deadlines right at the edge of \nfeasibility. You should be able to \nconsistently beat the buzzer (or at least \nbe close), but to do so should require \nteeth-gritting concentration.\nThe main motivation for this strategy \nis straightforward. Deep work requires \nlevels of concentration well beyond \nwhere most knowledge workers are \ncomfortable. Roosevelt dashes leverage \nartificial deadlines to help you \nsystematically increase the level you can \nregularly achieve—providing, in some\n\nsense, interval training for the attention \ncenters of your brain. An additional \nbenefit is that these dashes are \nincompatible with distraction (there’s no \nway you can give in to distraction and \nstill make your deadlines). Therefore, \nevery completed dash provides a \nsession in which you’re potentially \nbored, and really want to seek more \nnovel stimuli—but you resist.",

Intent on staying fit, even during \nthe long and dark New England winter, I \ndecided to take advantage of this \nproximity by traveling between home \nand work, to the greatest extent possible, \non foot.\nMy routine had me walk to campus in \nthe morning, crossing the Longfellow \nBridge in all weather (the city, it turns \nout to my dismay, is often slow to shovel \nthe pedestrian path after snowstorms). \nAround lunch, I would change into \nrunning gear and run back home on a \nlonger path that followed the banks of\n\nthe Charles, crossing at the \nMassachusetts Avenue Bridge. After a \nquick lunch and shower at home, I would \ntypically take the subway across the \nriver on the way back to campus (saving, \nperhaps, a third of a mile on the trek), \nand then walk home when the workday \nwas done. In other words, I spent a lot  \nof time on my feet during this period. It \nwas this reality that led me to develop \nthe practice that I’ll now suggest you \nadopt in your own deep work training: \nproductive meditation.\nThe goal of productive meditation is \nto take a period in which you’re \noccupied physically but not mentally— \nwalking, jogging, driving, showering—\n\nand focus your attention on a single \nwell-defined professional problem \nDepending on your profession, this \nproblem might be outlining an article, \nwriting a talk, making progress on a \nproof, or attempting to sharpen a \nbusiness strategy. As in mindfulness \nmeditation, you must continue to bring \nyour attention back to the problem at \nhand when it wanders or stalls.\nI used to practice productive \nmeditation in at least one of my daily \ncross-river treks while living in Boston, \nand as I improved, so did my results. I \nended up, for example, working out the \nchapter outlines for a significant portion \nof my last book while on foot, and made\n\nprogress on many knotty technical \nproblems in my academic research.\nI suggest that you adopt a productive \nmeditation practice in your own life. \nYou don’t necessarily need a serious \nsession every day, but your goal should \nbe to participate in at least two or three \nsuch sessions in a typical week. \nFortunately, finding time for this strategy \nis easy, as it takes advantage of periods \nthat would otherwise be wasted (such as \nwalking the dog or",

It \nwas this reality that led me to develop \nthe practice that I’ll now suggest you \nadopt in your own deep work training: \nproductive meditation.\nThe goal of productive meditation is \nto take a period in which you’re \noccupied physically but not mentally— \nwalking, jogging, driving, showering—\n\nand focus your attention on a single \nwell-defined professional problem \nDepending on your profession, this \nproblem might be outlining an article, \nwriting a talk, making progress on a \nproof, or attempting to sharpen a \nbusiness strategy. As in mindfulness \nmeditation, you must continue to bring \nyour attention back to the problem at \nhand when it wanders or stalls.\nI used to practice productive \nmeditation in at least one of my daily \ncross-river treks while living in Boston, \nand as I improved, so did my results. I \nended up, for example, working out the \nchapter outlines for a significant portion \nof my last book while on foot, and made\n\nprogress on many knotty technical \nproblems in my academic research.\nI suggest that you adopt a productive \nmeditation practice in your own life. \nYou don’t necessarily need a serious \nsession every day, but your goal should",

    "text": " commuting to work), \nand if done right, can actually increase \nyour professional productivity instead of \ntaking time away from your work. In \nfact, you might even consider scheduling \na walk during your workday specifically\n\nfor the purpose of applying productive \nmeditation to your most pressing \nproblem at the moment.\nI’m not, however, suggesting this \npractice for its productivity benefits \n(though they’re nice). I’m instead \ninterested in its ability to rapidly \nimprove your ability to think deeply. In \nmy experience, productive meditation \nbuilds on both of the key ideas \nintroduced at the beginning of this rule. \nBy forcing you to resist distraction and \nreturn your attention repeatedly to a \nwell-defined problem, it helps \nstrengthen your distraction-resisting \nmuscles, and by forcing you to push your \nfocus deeper and deeper on a single\n\nproblem, it sharpens your concentration.\nTo succeed with productive \nmeditation, it’s important to recognize \nthat, like any form of meditation, it \nrequires practice to do well. When I first \nattempted this strategy, back in the early \nweeks of my postdoc, I found myself \nhopelessly distracted—ending long \nstretches of “thinking” with little new to \nshow for my efforts. It took me a dozen \nor so sessions before I began to \nexperience real results. You should \nexpect something similar, so patience \nwill be necessary. To help accelerate \nthis ramp-up process, however, I have \ntwo specific suggestions to offer.\n\nSuggestion #1 : Be Wary of  \nDistractions and Looping\nAs a novice, when you begin a \nproductive meditation session, your \nmind’s first act of rebellion will be to \noffer unrelated but seemingly more \ninteresting thoughts. My mind, for \nexample, was often successful at \nderailing my attention by beginning to \ncompose an e-mail that I knew I needed \nto write. Objectively speaking, this train \nof thought sounds exceedingly dull, but \nin the moment it can become impossibly \ntantalizing. When you notice your \nattention slipping away from the \nproblem at hand, gently remind yourself\n\nthat you can return to that thought later, \nthen redirect your attention back.\nDistraction of this type, in many \nways, is the obvious enemy to defeat in \ndeveloping a productive meditation \nhabit. A subtler, but equally effective \nadversary, is looping. When faced with a \nhard problem, your mind, as it was \nevolved to do, will attempt to avoid \nexcess expenditure of energy when \npossible. One way it might attempt to \nsidestep this expenditure is by avoiding \ndiving deeper into the problem by \ninstead looping over and over again on \nwhat you already know about it. For \nexample, when working on a proof, my \nmind has a tendency to rehash simple\n\npreliminary results, again and again, to \navoid the harder work of building on \nthese results toward the needed solution. \nYou must be on your guard for looping, \nas it can quickly subvert an entire \nproductive meditation session. When \nyou notice it, remark to yourself that you \nseem to be in a loop, then redirect your \nattention toward the next step.\nSuggestion #2 : Structure Your  \nDeep Thinking\n“Thinking deeply” about a problem \nseems like a self-evident activity, but in \nreality it’s not. When faced with a\n\ndistraction-free mental landscape, a hard \nproblem, and time to think, the next steps \ncan become surprisingly non-obvious. In \nmy experience, it helps to have some \nstructure for this deep thinking process. I \nsuggest starting with a careful review of \nthe relevant variables  for solving the \nproblem and then storing these values in \nyour working memory. For example, if \nyou’re working on the outline for a book \nchapter, the relevant variables might be \nthe main points you want to make in the \nchapter. If you’re instead trying to solve \na mathematics proof, these variables \nmight be actual variables, or \nassumptions, or lemmas. Once the \nrelevant variables are identified, define\n\nthe specific next-step question  you need \nto answer using these variables. In the \nbook chapter example, this next-step \nquestion might be, “How am I going to \neffectively open this chapter?,” and for a \nproof it might be, “What can go wrong if \nI don’t assume this property holds?” \nWith the relevant variables stored and \nthe next-step question identified, you \nnow have a specific target for your \nattention.\nAssuming you’re able to solve your \nnext-step question, the final step o f this \nstructured approach to deep thinking is \nto consolidate  your gains by reviewing \nclearly the answer you identified. At this \npoint, you can push yourself to the next\n\nlevel of",

In \nfact, you might even consider scheduling \na walk during your workday specifically\n\nfor the purpose of applying productive \nmeditation to your most pressing \nproblem at the moment.\nI’m not, however, suggesting this \npractice for its productivity benefits \n(though they’re nice). I’m instead \ninterested in its ability to rapidly \nimprove your ability to think deeply. In \nmy experience, productive meditation \nbuilds on both of the key ideas \nintroduced at the beginning of this rule. \nBy forcing you to resist distraction and \nreturn your attention repeatedly to a \nwell-defined problem, it helps \nstrengthen your distraction-resisting \nmuscles, and by forcing you to push your \nfocus deeper and deeper on a single\n\nproblem, it sharpens your concentration.\nTo succeed with productive \nmeditation, it’s important to recognize \nthat, like any form of meditation, it \nrequires practice to do well. When I first \nattempted this strategy, back in the early \nweeks of my postdoc, I found myself \nhopelessly distracted—ending long \nstretches of “thinking” with little new to \nshow for my efforts. It took me a dozen \nor so sessions before I began to \nexperience real results. You should \nexpect something similar, so patience \nwill be necessary. To help accelerate \nthis ramp-up process, however, I have \ntwo specific suggestions to offer.\n\nSuggestion #1 : Be Wary of  \nDistractions and Looping\nAs a novice, when you begin a \nproductive meditation session, your \nmind’s first act of rebellion will be to \noffer unrelated but seemingly more \ninteresting thoughts. My mind, for \nexample, was often successful at \nderailing my attention by beginning to \ncompose an e-mail that I knew I needed \nto write. Objectively speaking, this train \nof thought sounds exceedingly dull, but \nin the moment it can become impossibly \ntantalizing. When you notice your \nattention slipping away from the \nproblem at hand, gently remind yourself\n\nthat you can return to that thought later, \nthen redirect your attention back.\nDistraction of this type, in many \nways, is the obvious enemy to defeat in \ndeveloping a productive meditation \nhabit. A subtler, but equally effective \nadversary, is looping. When faced with a \nhard",

    "text": " of meditation, it \nrequires practice to do well. When I first \nattempted this strategy, back in the early \nweeks of my postdoc, I found myself \nhopelessly distracted—ending long \nstretches of “thinking” with little new to \nshow for my efforts. It took me a dozen \nor so sessions before I began to \nexperience real results. You should \nexpect something similar, so patience \nwill be necessary. To help accelerate \nthis ramp-up process, however, I have \ntwo specific suggestions to offer.\n\nSuggestion #1 : Be Wary of  \nDistractions and Looping\nAs a novice, when you begin a \nproductive meditation session, your \nmind’s first act of rebellion will be to \noffer unrelated but seemingly more \ninteresting thoughts. My mind, for \nexample, was often successful at \nderailing my attention by beginning to \ncompose an e-mail that I knew I needed \nto write. Objectively speaking, this train \nof thought sounds exceedingly dull, but \nin the moment it can become impossibly \ntantalizing. When you notice your \nattention slipping away from the \nproblem at hand, gently remind yourself\n\nthat you can return to that thought later, \nthen redirect your attention",

A subtler, but equally effective \nadversary, is looping. When faced with a \nhard problem, your mind, as it was \nevolved to do, will attempt to avoid \nexcess expenditure of energy when \npossible. One way it might attempt to \nsidestep this expenditure is by avoiding \ndiving deeper into the problem by \ninstead looping over and over again on \nwhat you already know about it. For \nexample, when working on a proof, my \nmind has a tendency to rehash simple\n\npreliminary results, again and again, to \navoid the harder work of building on \nthese results toward the needed solution. \nYou must be on your guard for looping, \nas it can quickly subvert an entire \nproductive meditation session. When \nyou notice it, remark to yourself that you \nseem to be in a loop, then redirect your \nattention toward the next step.\nSuggestion #2 : Structure Your  \nDeep Thinking\n“Thinking deeply” about a problem \nseems like a self-evident activity, but in \nreality it’s not. When faced with a\n\ndistraction-free mental landscape, a hard \nproblem, and time to think, the next steps \ncan become surprisingly non-obvious. In \nmy experience, it helps to have some \nstructure for this deep thinking process. I \nsuggest starting with a careful review of \nthe relevant variables  for solving the \nproblem and then storing these values in \nyour working memory. For example, if \nyou’re working on the outline for a book \nchapter, the relevant variables might be \nthe main points you want to make in the \nchapter. If you’re instead trying to solve \na mathematics proof, these variables \nmight be actual variables, or \nassumptions, or lemmas. Once the \nrelevant variables are identified, define\n\nthe specific next-step question  you need \nto answer using these variables. In the \nbook chapter example, this next-step \nquestion might be, “How am I going to \neffectively open this chapter?,” and for a \nproof it might be, “What can go wrong if \nI don’t assume this property holds?” \nWith the relevant variables stored and \nthe next-step question identified, you \nnow have a specific target for your \nattention.\nAssuming you’re able to solve",

A subtler, but equally effective \nadversary, is looping. When faced with a \nhard problem, your mind, as it was \nevolved to do, will attempt to avoid \nexcess expenditure of energy when \npossible. One way it might attempt to \nsidestep this expenditure is by avoiding \ndiving deeper into the problem by \ninstead looping over and over again on \nwhat you already know about it. For \nexample, when working on a proof, my \nmind has a tendency to rehash simple\n\npreliminary results, again and again, to \navoid the harder work of building on \nthese results toward the needed solution. \nYou must be on your guard for looping, \nas it can quickly subvert an entire \nproductive meditation session. When \nyou notice it, remark to yourself that you \nseem to be in a loop, then redirect your \nattention toward the next step.\nSuggestion #2 : Structure Your  \nDeep Thinking\n“Thinking deeply” about a problem \nseems like a self-evident activity, but in \nreality it’s not.",

When faced with a\n\ndistraction-free mental landscape, a hard \nproblem, and time to think, the next steps \ncan become surprisingly non-obvious. In \nmy experience, it helps to have some \nstructure for this deep thinking process. I \nsuggest starting with a careful review of \nthe relevant variables  for solving the \nproblem and then storing these values in \nyour working memory. For example, if \nyou’re working on the outline for a book \nchapter, the relevant variables might be \nthe main points you want to make in the \nchapter. If you’re instead trying to solve \na mathematics proof, these variables \nmight be actual variables, or \nassumptions, or lemmas. Once the \nrelevant variables are identified, define\n\nthe specific next-step question  you need \nto answer using these variables. In the \nbook chapter example, this next-step \nquestion might be, “How am I going to \neffectively open this chapter?,” and for a \nproof it might",

    "text": " your \nnext-step question, the final step o f this \nstructured approach to deep thinking is \nto consolidate  your gains by reviewing \nclearly the answer you identified. At this \npoint, you can push yourself to the next\n\nlevel of depth by starting the process \nover. This cycle of reviewing and \nstoring variables, identifying and \ntackling the next-step question, then \nconsolidating your gains is like an \nintense workout routine for your \nconcentration ability. It will help you get \nmore out of your productive meditation \nsessions and accelerate the pace at \nwhich you improve your ability to go \ndeep.\nMemorize a Deck of Cards\nGiven just five minutes, Daniel Kilov \ncan memorize any of the following: a\n\nshuffled deck of cards, a string of one \nhundred random digits, or 115 abstract \nshapes (this last feat establishing an \nAustralian national record). It shouldn’t \nbe surprising, therefore, that Kilov \nrecently won back-to-back silver medals \nin the Australian memory \nchampionships. What is perhaps \nsurprising, given Kilov’s history, is that \nhe ended up a mental athlete at all.\n“I wasn’t born with an exceptional \nmemory,” Kilov told me. Indeed, during \nhigh school he considered himself \nforgetful and disorganized. He also \nstruggled academically and was \neventually diagnosed with attention \ndeficit disorder. It was after a chance\n\nencounter with Tansel Ali, one of the \ncountry’s most successful and visible \nmemory champions, that Kilov began to \nseriously train his memory. By the time \nhe earned his college degree he had won \nhis first national competition medal.\nThis transformation into a world- \nclass mental athlete was rapid, but not \nunprecedented. In 2006, the American \nscience writer Joshua Foer won the USA \nMemory Championship after only a year \nof (intense) training—a journey he \nchronicled in his 2011 bestseller, \nMoonwalking with Einstein.  But what’s \nimportant to us about Kilov’s story is \nwhat happened to his academic  \nperformance during this period of\n\nintensive memory development. While \ntraining his brain, he went from a \nstruggling student with attention deficit \ndisorder to graduating from a demanding \nAustralian university with first-class \nhonors. He was soon accepted into the \nPhD program at one of the country’s top \nuniversities, where he currently studies \nunder a renowned philosopher.\nOne explanation for this \ntransformation comes from research led \nby Henry Roediger, who runs the \nMemory Lab at the University of \nWashington in Saint Louis. In 2014, \nRoediger and his collaborators sent a \nteam, equipped with a battery of \ncognitive tests, to the Extreme Memory\n\nTournament held in San Diego. They \nwanted to understand what differentiated \nthese elite memorizers from the \npopulation at large. “We found that one \nof the biggest differences between \nmemory athletes and the rest of us is in a \ncognitive ability that’s not a direct \nmeasure of memory at all but of  \nattention ,” explained Roediger in a New \nYork Times  blog post (emphasis mine). \nThe ability in question is called \n“attentional control,\" and it measures the \nsubjects’  ability to maintain their focus \non essential information.\nA side effect of memory training, in \nother words, is an improvement in your \ngeneral ability to concentrate. This\n\nability can then be fruitfully applied to \nany task demanding deep work. Daniel \nKilov, we can therefore conjecture, \ndidn’t become a star student because of \nhis award-winning memory; it was \ninstead his quest to improve this memory \nthat (incidentally) gave him the deep \nwork edge needed to thrive \nacademically.\nThe strategy described here asks you \nto replicate a key piece of Kilov’s \ntraining, and therefore gain some of the \nsame improvements to your \nconcentration. In particular, it asks you \nto learn a standard but quite impressive \nskill in the repertoire of most mental \nathletes: the ability to memorize a\n\nshuffled deck of cards.\nThe technique for card memorization I’ll \nteach you comes from someone who \nknows quite a bit about this particular \nchallenge: Ron White, a former USA \nMemory Champion and world record \nholder in card memorization. -  The first \nthing White emphasizes is that \nprofessional memory athletes never  \nattempt rote memorization, that is, where \nyou simply look at information again and \nagain, repeating it in your head. This \napproach to retention, though popular \namong burned-out students, \nmisunderstands how our brains work. \nWe’re not wired to quickly internalize\n\nabstract information. We are, however, \nreally good at remembering scenes. \nThink back",

At this \npoint, you can push yourself to the next\n\nlevel of depth by starting the process \nover. This cycle of reviewing and \nstoring variables, identifying and \ntackling the next-step question, then \nconsolidating your gains is like an \nintense workout routine for your \nconcentration ability. It will help you get \nmore out of your productive meditation \nsessions and accelerate the pace at \nwhich you improve your ability to go \ndeep.\nMemorize a Deck of Cards\nGiven just five minutes, Daniel Kilov \ncan memorize any of the following: a\n\nshuffled deck of cards, a string of one \nhundred random digits, or 115 abstract \nshapes (this last feat establishing an \nAustralian national record). It shouldn’t \nbe surprising, therefore, that Kilov \nrecently won back-to-back silver medals \nin the Australian memory \nchampionships. What is perhaps \nsurprising, given Kilov’s history, is that \nhe ended up a mental athlete at all.\n“I wasn’t born with an exceptional \nmemory,” Kilov told me. Indeed, during \nhigh school he considered himself \nforgetful and disorganized. He also \nstruggled academically and was \neventually diagnosed with attention \ndeficit disorder. It was after a chance\n\nencounter with Tansel Ali, one of the \ncountry’s most successful and visible \nmemory champions, that Kilov began to \nseriously train his memory. By the time \nhe earned his college degree he had won \nhis first national competition medal.\nThis transformation into a world- \nclass mental athlete was rapid, but not \nunprecedented. In 2006, the American \nscience writer Joshua Foer won the USA \nMemory Championship after only a year \nof (intense) training—a journey he \nchronicled in his 2011 bestseller, \nMoonwalking with Einstein.  But what’s \nimportant to us about Kilov’s story is \nwhat happened to his academic  \nperformance during this period of\n\nintensive memory development. While \ntraining his brain, he went from a \nstruggling student with attention deficit \ndisorder to graduating from a demanding \nAustralian university with first-class \nhonors. He was soon accepted into the \nPhD program at one of the country’s",

At this \npoint, you can push yourself to the next\n\nlevel of depth by starting the process \nover. This cycle of reviewing and \nstoring variables, identifying and \ntackling the next-step question, then \nconsolidating your gains is like an \nintense workout routine for your \nconcentration ability. It will help you get \nmore out of your productive meditation \nsessions and accelerate the pace at \nwhich you improve your ability to go \ndeep.\nMemorize a Deck of Cards\nGiven just five minutes, Daniel Kilov \ncan memorize any of the following: a\n\nshuffled deck of cards, a string of one \nhundred random digits, or 115 abstract \nshapes (this last feat establishing an \nAustralian national record). It shouldn’t \nbe surprising, therefore, that Kilov \nrecently won back-to-back silver medals \nin the Australian memory \nchampionships. What is perhaps \nsurprising, given Kilov’s history, is that \nhe ended up a mental athlete at all.\n“I wasn’t born with an exceptional \nmemory",

What is perhaps \nsurprising, given Kilov’s history, is that \nhe ended up a mental athlete at all.\n“I wasn’t born with an exceptional \nmemory,” Kilov told me. Indeed, during \nhigh school he considered himself \nforgetful and disorganized. He also \nstruggled academically and was \neventually diagnosed with attention \ndeficit disorder. It was after a chance\n\nencounter with Tansel Ali, one of the \ncountry’s most successful and visible \nmemory champions, that Kilov began to \nseriously train his memory. By the time \nhe earned his college degree he had won \nhis first national competition medal.\nThis transformation into a world- \nclass mental athlete was rapid, but not \nunprecedented. In 2006, the American \nscience writer Joshua Foer won the USA \nMemory Championship after only a year \nof (intense) training—a journey he \nchronicled in his 2011 bestseller, \nMoonwalking with Einstein.  But what’s \nimportant to us about Kilov’s story is \nwhat happened to his academic  \nperformance during this period of\n\nintensive memory development. While",

    "text": " \ntraining his brain, he went from a \nstruggling student with attention deficit \ndisorder to graduating from a demanding \nAustralian university with first-class \nhonors. He was soon accepted into the \nPhD program at one of the country’s top \nuniversities, where he currently studies \nunder a renowned philosopher.\nOne explanation for this \ntransformation comes from research led \nby Henry Roediger, who runs the \nMemory Lab at the University of \nWashington in Saint Louis. In 2014, \nRoediger and his collaborators sent a \nteam, equipped with a battery of \ncognitive tests, to the Extreme Memory\n\nTournament held in San Diego. They \nwanted to understand what differentiated \nthese elite memorizers from the \npopulation at large. “We found that one \nof the biggest differences between \nmemory athletes and the rest of us is in a \ncognitive ability that’s not a direct \nmeasure of memory at all but of  \nattention ,” explained Roediger in a New \nYork Times  blog post (emphasis mine). \nThe ability in question is called \n“attentional control,\" and it measures the \nsubjects’  ability to maintain their focus \non essential information.\nA side effect of memory training, in \nother words, is an improvement in your \ngeneral ability to concentrate. This\n\nability can then be fruitfully applied to \nany task demanding deep work. Daniel \nKilov, we can therefore conjecture, \ndidn’t become a star student because of \nhis award-winning memory; it was \ninstead his quest to improve this memory \nthat (incidentally) gave him the deep \nwork edge needed to thrive \nacademically.\nThe strategy described here asks you \nto replicate a key piece of Kilov’s \ntraining, and therefore gain some of the \nsame improvements to your \nconcentration. In particular, it asks you \nto learn a standard but quite impressive \nskill in the repertoire of most mental \nathletes: the ability to memorize a\n\nshuffled deck of cards.\nThe technique for card memorization I’ll \nteach you comes from someone who \nknows quite a bit about this particular \nchallenge: Ron White, a former USA \nMemory Champion and world record \nholder in card memorization. -  The first \nthing White emphasizes is that \nprofessional memory athletes never  \nattempt rote memorization, that is, where \nyou simply look at information again and \nagain, repeating it in your head.

In 2014, \nRoediger and his collaborators sent a \nteam, equipped with a battery of \ncognitive tests, to the Extreme Memory\n\nTournament held in San Diego. They \nwanted to understand what differentiated \nthese elite memorizers from the \npopulation at large. “We found that one \nof the biggest differences between \nmemory athletes and the rest of us is in a \ncognitive ability that’s not a direct \nmeasure of memory at all but of  \nattention ,” explained Roediger in a New \nYork Times  blog post (emphasis mine). \nThe ability in question is called \n“attentional control,\" and it measures the \nsubjects’  ability to maintain their focus \non essential information.\nA side effect of memory training,",

    "text": " a New \nYork Times  blog post (emphasis mine). \nThe ability in question is called \n“attentional control,\" and it measures the \nsubjects’  ability to maintain their focus \non essential information.\nA side effect of memory training, in \nother words, is an improvement in your \ngeneral ability to concentrate. This\n\nability can then be fruitfully applied to \nany task demanding deep work. Daniel \nKilov, we can therefore conjecture, \ndidn’t become a star student because of \nhis award-winning memory; it was \ninstead his quest to improve this memory \nthat (incidentally) gave him the deep \nwork edge needed to thrive \nacademically.\nThe strategy described here asks you \nto replicate a key piece of Kilov’s \ntraining, and therefore gain some of the \nsame improvements to your \nconcentration. In particular, it asks you \nto learn a standard but quite impressive \nskill in the repertoire of most mental \nathletes: the ability to memorize a\n\nshuffled deck of cards.\nThe technique for card memorization I’ll \nteach you comes from someone who \nknows quite a bit about this particular \nchallenge: Ron White, a former USA \nMemory Champion and world record \nholder",

    "text": "approach to retention, though popular \namong burned-out students, \nmisunderstands how our brains work. \nWe’re not wired to quickly internalize\n\nabstract information. We are, however, \nreally good at remembering scenes. \nThink back to a recent memorable event \nin your life: perhaps attending the \nopening session of a conference or \nmeeting a friend you haven’t seen in a \nwhile for a drink. Try to picture the \nscene as clearly as possible. Most \npeople in this scenario can conjure a \nsurprisingly vivid recollection of the \nevent—even though you made no special \neffort to remember it at the time. If you \nsystematically counted the unique details \nin this memory, the total number of items \nwould likely be surprisingly numerous. \nYour mind, in other words, can quickly \nretain lots of detailed information—if\n\nit’s stored in the right way. Ron White’s \ncard memorization technique builds on \nthis insight.\nTo prepare for this high-volume \nmemorization task, White recommends \nthat you begin by cementing in your mind \nthe mental image of walking through five \nrooms in your home. Perhaps you come \nin the door, walk through your front \nhallway, then turn into the downstairs \nbathroom, walk out the door and enter \nthe guest bedroom, walk into the kitchen, \nand then head down the stairs into your \nbasement. In each room, conjure a clear \nimage of what you see.\nOnce you can easily recall this \nmental walkthrough of a well-known\n\nlocation, fix in your mind a collection of \nten items in each of these rooms. White \nrecommends that these items be large \n(and therefore more memorable), like a \ndesk, not a pencil. Next, establish an \norder in which you look at each of these \nitems in each room For example, in the \nfront hallway, you might look at the entry \nmat, then shoes on the floor by the mat, \nthen the bench above the shoes, and so \non. Combined this is only fifty items, so \nadd two more items, perhaps in your \nbackyard, to get to the full fifty-two \nitems you’ll later need when connecting \nthese images to all the cards in a \nstandard deck.\nPractice this mental exercise of\n\nwalking through the rooms, and looking \nat items in each room, in a set order. You \nshould find that this type of \nmemorization, because it’s based on \nvisual images of familiar places and \nthings, will be much easier than the rote \nmemorizing you might remember from \nyour school days.\nThe second step in preparing to \nmemorize a deck of cards is to associate \na memorable person or thing with each \nof the fifty-two possible cards. To make \nthis process easier, try to maintain some \nlogical association between the card and \nthe corresponding image. White \nprovides the example of associating \nDonald Trump with the King of\n\nDiamonds, as diamonds signify wealth. \nPractice these associations until you can \npull a card randomly from the deck and \nimmediately recall the associated image. \nAs before, the use of memorable visual \nimages and associations will simplify \nthe task of forming these connections.\nThe two steps mentioned previously \nare advance  steps—things you do just \nonce and can then leverage again and \nagain in memorizing specific decks. \nOnce these steps are done, you’re ready \nfor the main event: memorizing as \nquickly as possible the order of fifty-two \ncards in a freshly shuffled deck. The \nmethod here is straightforward. Begin \nyour mental walk-through of your house.\n\nAs you encounter each item, look at the \nnext card from the shuffled deck, and \nimagine the corresponding memorable \nperson or thing doing something \nmemorable near that item For example, \nif the first item and location is the mat in \nyour front entry, and the first card is the \nKing of Diamonds, you might picture \nDonald Trump wiping mud off of his \nexpensive loafers on the entry mat in \nyour front hallway.\nProceed carefully through the rooms, \nassociating the proper mental images \nwith objects in the proper order. Af ter \nyou complete a room, you might want to \nwalk through it a few times in a row to \nlock in the imagery. Once you’re done,\n\nyou’re ready to hand the deck to a friend \nand amaze him by rattling off the cards \nin order without peeking. To do so, of \ncourse, simply requires that you perform \nthe mental walk-through one more time, \nconnecting each memorable person or \nthing to its corresponding card as you \nturn your attention to it.\nIf you practice this technique, you’ll \ndiscover, like many mental athletes who \ncame before you, that you can eventually \ninternalize a whole deck in just minutes. \nMore important than your ability to \nimpress friends, of",

We are, however, \nreally good at remembering scenes. \nThink back to a recent memorable event \nin your life: perhaps attending the \nopening session of a conference or \nmeeting a friend you haven’t seen in a \nwhile for a drink. Try to picture the \nscene as clearly as possible. Most \npeople in this scenario can conjure a \nsurprisingly vivid recollection of the \nevent—even though you made no special \neffort to remember it at the time. If you \nsystematically counted the unique details \nin this memory, the total number of items \nwould likely be surprisingly numerous. \nYour mind, in other words, can quickly \nretain lots of detailed information—if\n\nit’s stored in the right way. Ron White’s \ncard memorization technique builds on \nthis insight.\nTo prepare for this high-volume \nmemorization task, White recommends \nthat you begin by cementing in your mind \nthe mental image of walking through five \nrooms in your home. Perhaps you come \nin the door, walk through your front \nhallway, then turn into the downstairs \nbathroom, walk out the door and enter \nthe guest bedroom, walk into the kitchen, \nand then head down the stairs into your \nbasement. In each room, conjure a clear \nimage of what you see.\nOnce you can easily recall this \nmental walkthrough of a well-known\n\nlocation, fix in your mind a collection of \nten items in each of these rooms. White \nrecommends that these items be large \n(and therefore more memorable), like a \ndesk, not a pencil. Next, establish an \norder in which you look at each of these \nitems in each room For example, in the \nfront hallway, you might look at the entry \nmat, then shoes on the floor by the mat, \nthen the bench above the shoes, and so \non. Combined this is only fifty items, so \nadd two more items, perhaps in your \nbackyard, to get to the full fifty-two \nitems you’ll later need when connecting \nthese images to all the cards in a \nstandard deck.\nPractice this mental exercise of\n\nwalking through the rooms, and looking \nat items in each room, in a set order. You \nshould find that this type of \nmemorization, because it’s",

Ron White’s \ncard memorization technique builds on \nthis insight.\nTo prepare for this high-volume \nmemorization task, White recommends \nthat you begin by cementing in your mind \nthe mental image of walking through five \nrooms in your home.

    "text": "memorization task, White recommends \nthat you begin by cementing in your mind \nthe mental image of walking through five \nrooms in your home. Perhaps you come \nin the door, walk through your front \nhallway, then turn into the downstairs \nbathroom, walk out the door and enter \nthe guest bedroom, walk into the kitchen, \nand then head down the stairs into your \nbasement. In each room, conjure a clear \nimage of what you see.\nOnce you can easily recall this \nmental walkthrough of a well-known\n\nlocation, fix in your mind a collection of \nten items in each of these rooms. White \nrecommends that these items be large \n(and therefore more memorable), like a \ndesk, not a pencil. Next, establish an \norder in which you look at each of these \nitems in each room For example, in the \nfront hallway, you might look at the entry \nmat, then shoes on the floor by the mat, \nthen the bench above the shoes, and so \non. Combined this is only fifty items, so \nadd two more items, perhaps in your \nbackyard, to get to the full fifty-two \nitems you’ll later need when connecting \nthese images to",

    "text": " all the cards in a \nstandard deck.\nPractice this mental exercise of\n\nwalking through the rooms, and looking \nat items in each room, in a set order. You \nshould find that this type of \nmemorization, because it’s based on \nvisual images of familiar places and \nthings, will be much easier than the rote \nmemorizing you might remember from \nyour school days.\nThe second step in preparing to \nmemorize a deck of cards is to associate \na memorable person or thing with each \nof the fifty-two possible cards. To make \nthis process easier, try to maintain some \nlogical association between the card and \nthe corresponding image. White \nprovides the example of associating \nDonald Trump with the King of\n\nDiamonds, as diamonds signify wealth. \nPractice these associations until you can \npull a card randomly from the deck and \nimmediately recall the associated image. \nAs before, the use of memorable visual \nimages and associations will simplify \nthe task of forming these connections.\nThe two steps mentioned previously \nare advance  steps—things you do just \nonce and can then leverage again and \nagain in memorizing specific decks. \nOnce these steps are done, you’re ready \nfor the main event: memorizing as \nquickly as possible the order of fifty-two \ncards in a freshly shuffled deck. The \nmethod here is straightforward. Begin \nyour mental walk-through of your house.\n\nAs you encounter each item, look at the \nnext card from the shuffled deck, and \nimagine the corresponding memorable \nperson or thing doing something \nmemorable near that item For example, \nif the first item and location is the mat in \nyour front entry, and the first card is the \nKing of Diamonds, you might picture \nDonald Trump wiping mud off of his \nexpensive loafers on the entry mat in \nyour front hallway.\nProceed carefully through the rooms, \nassociating the proper mental images \nwith objects in the proper order. Af ter \nyou complete a room, you might want to \nwalk through it a few times in a row to \nlock in the imagery. Once you’re done,\n\nyou’re ready to hand the deck to a friend \nand amaze him by rattling off the cards \nin order without peeking. To do so, of \ncourse, simply requires that you perform \nthe mental walk-through one more time, \nconnecting each memorable person or \nthing to its corresponding card as you \nturn your attention to",

To make \nthis process easier, try to maintain some \nlogical association between the card and \nthe corresponding image.

The \nmethod here is straightforward. Begin \nyour mental walk-through of your house.\n\nAs you encounter each item, look at the \nnext card from the shuffled deck, and \nimagine the corresponding memorable \nperson or thing doing something \nmemorable near that item For example, \nif the first item and location is the mat in \nyour front entry, and the first card is the \nKing of Diamonds, you might picture \nDonald Trump wiping mud off of his \nexpensive loafers on the entry mat in \nyour front hallway.\nProceed carefully through the rooms, \nassociating the proper mental images \nwith objects in the proper order. Af ter \nyou complete a room, you might want to \nwalk through it a few times in a row to \nlock in the imagery. Once you’re done,\n\nyou’re ready to hand the deck to a friend \nand amaze him by rattling off",

    "text": " it.\nIf you practice this technique, you’ll \ndiscover, like many mental athletes who \ncame before you, that you can eventually \ninternalize a whole deck in just minutes. \nMore important than your ability to \nimpress friends, of course, is the training \nsuch activities provide your mind. \nProceeding through the steps described\n\nearlier requires that you focus your \nattention, again and again, on a clear \ntarget. Like a muscle responding to \nweights, this will strengthen your \ngeneral ability to concentrate—allowing \nyou to go deeper with more ease.\nIt’s worth emphasizing, however, the \nobvious point that there’s nothing special \nabout card memorization. Any structured \nthought process that requires unwavering \nattention can have a similar effect—be it \nstudying the Talmud, like Adam Marlin \nfrom Rule #2’s introduction, or \npracticing productive meditation, or \ntrying to learn the guitar part of a song \nby ear (a past favorite of mine). If card \nmemorization seems weird to you, in\n\nother words, then choose a replacement \nthat makes similar cognitive \nrequirements. The key to this strategy is \nnot the specifics, but instead the \nmotivating idea that your ability to \nconcentrate is only as strong as your \ncommitment to train it.",

    "text": " it.\nIf you practice this technique, you’ll \ndiscover, like many mental athletes who \ncame before you, that you can eventually \ninternalize a whole deck in just minutes. \nMore important than your ability to \nimpress friends, of course, is the training \nsuch activities provide your mind. \nProceeding through the steps described\n\nearlier requires that you focus your \nattention, again and again, on a clear \ntarget. Like a muscle responding to \nweights, this will strengthen your \ngeneral ability to concentrate—allowing \nyou to go deeper with more ease.\nIt’s worth emphasizing, however, the \nobvious point that there’s nothing special \nabout card memorization. Any structured \nthought process that requires unwavering \nattention can have a similar effect—be it \nstudying the Talmud, like Adam Marlin \nfrom Rule #2’s introduction, or \npracticing productive meditation, or \ntrying to learn the guitar part of a song \nby ear (a past favorite of mine). If card \nmemorization seems weird to you, in\n\nother words, then choose a replacement \nthat makes similar cognitive \nrequirements. The key to this strategy is \nnot the specifics, but instead the \nmotivating idea that your ability to \nconcentrate is only as strong as your \ncommitment to train it.",
