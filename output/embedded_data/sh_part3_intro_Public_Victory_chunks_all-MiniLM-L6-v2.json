Private Victory precedes Public Victory.  \nAlgebra comes before calculus.    As we look back and survey the terrain to  determine where we've be en and where we are in \nrelationship to where we're going, we clearly see that we could not have go tten where we are without \ncoming the way we came.  There aren't any other roads;  there aren't any shortcuts.  There's no way to \nparachute into this terrain.  The landscape ahead is covered with the fragments of broken relationships \nof people who have tried.  They've tried to jump into effective relationship s without the maturity, the \nstrength of character, to maintain them. \n   But you just can't do it; you simply have to travel the road.  You can't be successful with other people if you haven't paid the price of success with yourself.    A few years ago when I was giving a seminar on the Oregon coast, a man came up to me and said, \n\"You know, Stephen, I really don't enjoy coming  to these seminars.\"  He had my attention. \n   \"Look at everyone else here,\" he continued.  \"Look at this beautiful coastline and the sea out there \nand all that's happening.  All I can do is sit and wo rry about the grilling I'm goin g to get from my wife \ntonight on the phone.    \"She gives me the third degree every time I'm away.  Where did I eat breakfast?  Who else was \nthere?  Was I in meetings all morning?  When did we stop for lunch?  What did I do during lunch?  \nHow did I spend the afternoon?  What did I do for en tertainment in the evening?  Who was with me?  \nWhat did we talk about?    \"And what she really wants to know, but never qu ite asks, is who she can call to verify everything I \ntell her.  She just nags me and questions everything I do whenever I'm away.  It's taken the bloom out \nof this whole experience.  I really don't enjoy it at all.\"    He did look pretty miserable.  We talked for a while, and then he  made a very interesting comment.  \n\"I guess she knows all the questions to ask,\" he said  a little sheepishly.  \"It was at a seminar like this \nthat I met her when I was married to someone else!\"    I considered the implications of his comment and then said, \"You're kind of into 'quick fix,' aren't \nyou?\"    \"What do you mean?\" he replied.    \"Well, you'd like to take a screwdriver and just open up your wife's head and rewire that attitude of hers really fast, wouldn't you?\"    \"Sure, I'd like her to change,\" he  exclaimed.  \"I don't think it's right for her to constantly grill me like \nshe does.\"    \"My friend,\" I said, \"you can't talk your way out of problems you behave yourself into.\" \n   We're dealing with a very dramatic and very  fundamental Paradigm Shift here.  You may try to \nlubricate your social interactions with personality techniques and skills, but in the process, you may \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \ntruncate the vital character base.  You can't have th e fruits without the roots.  It's the principle of \nsequencing: Private Victory precedes Public Vict ory.  Self-mastery and self-discipline are the \nfoundation of good relationships with others.    Some people say that you have to like yourself before you can like others.  I think that idea has merit, but if you don't know yourself, if you don' t control yourself, if you don't have mastery over \nyourself, it's very hard to like yourself, except  in some short-term, psych-up, superficial way.",

Private Victory precedes Public Victory.  \nAlgebra comes before calculus.    As we look back and survey the terrain to  determine where we've be en and where we are in \nrelationship to where we're going, we clearly see that we could not have go tten where we are without \ncoming the way we came.  There aren't any other roads;  there aren't any shortcuts.  There's no way to \nparachute into this terrain.  The landscape ahead is covered with the fragments of broken relationships \nof people who have tried.  They've tried to jump into effective relationship s without the maturity, the \nstrength of character, to maintain them. \n   But you just can't do it; you simply have to travel the road.  You can't be successful with other people if you haven't paid the price of success with yourself.    A few years ago when I was giving a seminar on the Oregon coast, a man came up to me and said, \n\"You know, Stephen, I really don't enjoy coming  to these seminars.\"  He had my attention. \n   \"Look at everyone else here,\" he continued.  \"Look at this beautiful coastline and the sea out there \nand all that's happening.  All I can do is sit and wo rry about the grilling I'm goin g to get from my wife \ntonight on the phone.    \"She gives me the third degree every time I'm away.  Where did I eat breakfast?  Who else was \nthere?  Was I in meetings all morning?  When did we stop for lunch?  What did I do during lunch?  \nHow did I spend the afternoon?  What did I do for en tertainment in the evening?  Who was with me?  \n",

    "text": " merit, but if you don't know yourself, if you don' t control yourself, if you don't have mastery over \nyourself, it's very hard to like yourself, except  in some short-term, psych-up, superficial way. \n   Real self-respect comes from dominion over self , from true independence.  And that's the focus of \nHabits 1, 2, and 3.  Independence is an achievement.   Interdependence is a choice only independent \npeople can make.  Unless we are willing to achieve re al independence, it's foolish to try to develop \nhuman-relations skills.  We might try.  We might even have some degree of success when the sun is \nshining.  But when the difficult ti mes come -- and they will -- we wo n't have the foundation to keep \nthings together.    The most important ingredient we put into any relationship is not what we say or what we do, but \nwhat we are.  And if our words an d our actions come from superficia l human-relations techniques (the \npersonality ethic) rather than from our own inner core (the character ethic), others will sense that \nduplicity.  We simply won't be able to create and sustain the foundation necessary for effective \ninterdependence.    The techniques and skills that really make a diffe rence in human interaction are the ones that almost \nnaturally flow from a truly independent character.  So the place to begin building any relationship is \ninside ourselves, inside our Circle of Influenc e, our own character.  As we become independent -- \nproactive, centered in correct principles, value dr iven and able to organize and execute around the \npriorities in our life with integr ity -- we then can choose to beco me interdependent -- capable of \nbuilding rich, enduring, highly producti ve relationships with other people. \n   As we look at the terrai n ahead, we see that we're ente ring a whole new dimension.  \nInterdependence opens up worlds of possibilitie s for deep, rich, meaningful associations, for \ngeometrically increased productivity, for serving, for contributing, for learning, for growing.  But it is \nalso where we feel the greatest pain , the greatest frustration, the grea test roadblocks to happiness and \nsuccess.  And we're very aware of that pain because it is acute. \n   We can often live for years with the chronic pain of our lack of vision, lead ership or management in \nour personal lives.  We feel vaguely uneasy and unco mfortable and occasionally take steps to ease the \npain, at least for a time.  But the pain is chro nic, we get used to it, we learn to live with it. \n   But when we have problems in our interactions with other people, we're very aware of acute pain -- \nit's often intense, and we want it to go away.    That's when we try to treat the symptoms with quick fixes and techniques -- the band-aids of the \npersonality ethic.  We don't understand that the acute pain is an outgrowth of the deeper, chronic \nproblem.  And until we stop treati ng the symptoms and start treati ng the problem, our efforts will \nonly bring counterproductive results.  We will only  be successful at obscurin g the chronic pain even \nmore.    Now, as we think of effective interaction with others, let's go back to our earlier definition of \neffectiveness.  We've said it's th e P/PC Balance, the fundamental conc ept in the story of the Goose and \nthe Golden Egg.    In an interdependent situation, the golden e ggs are the effectiveness, the wonderful synergy, the \nresults created by open communication  and positive interaction with ot hers.  And to get those eggs on \na regular basis, we need to take care of the goose.  We need to create and care  for the relationships that \nmake those results realities.    So before we descend from our point of reconna issance and get into Habits 4, 5, and 6, I would like \nto introduce what I believe to be a very powerful me taphor in describing relati onships and in defining \nthe P/PC Balance in an interdependent reality. \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n \nThe Emotional Bank Account TM     We all know what a financial bank account is.

    "text": " merit, but if you don't know yourself, if you don' t control yourself, if you don't have mastery over \nyourself, it's very hard to like yourself, except  in some short-term, psych-up, superficial way. \n   Real self-respect comes from dominion over self , from true independence.  And that's the focus of \nHabits 1, 2, and 3.  Independence is an achievement.   Interdependence is a choice only independent \npeople can make.  Unless we are willing to achieve re al independence, it's foolish to try to develop \nhuman-relations skills.  We might try.  We might even have some degree of success when the sun is \nshining.  But when the difficult ti mes come -- and they will -- we wo n't have the foundation to keep \nthings together.    The most important ingredient we put into any relationship is not what we say or what we do, but \nwhat we are.  And if our words an d our actions come from superficia l human-relations techniques (the \npersonality ethic) rather than from our own inner core (the character ethic), others will sense that \nduplicity.  We simply won't be able to create and sustain the foundation necessary for effective \ninterdependence.    The techniques and skills that really make a diffe rence in human interaction are the ones that almost \nnaturally flow from a truly independent character.  So the place to begin building any relationship is \ninside ourselves, inside our Circle of Influenc e, our own character.  As we become independent -- \nproactive, centered in correct principles, value dr iven and able to organize and execute around the \npriorities in our life with integr ity -- we then can choose to beco me interdependent -- capable of \nbuilding rich, enduring, highly producti ve relationships with other people. \n   As we look at the terrai n ahead, we see that we're ente ring a whole new dimension.  \nInterdependence opens up worlds of possibilitie s for deep, rich, meaningful associations, for \ngeometrically increased productivity, for serving, for contributing, for learning, for growing.  But it is \nalso where we feel the greatest pain , the greatest frustration, the grea test roadblocks to happiness and \nsuccess.  And we're very aware of that pain because it is acute. \n   We can often live for years with the chronic pain",

And that's the focus of \nHabits 1, 2, and 3.  Independence is an achievement.   Interdependence is a choice only independent \npeople can make.  Unless we are willing to achieve re al independence, it's foolish to try to develop \nhuman-relations skills.  We might try.  We might even have some degree of success when the sun is \nshining.  But when the difficult ti mes come -- and they will -- we wo n't have the foundation to keep \nthings together.    The most important ingredient we put into any relationship is not what we say or what we do, but \nwhat we are.  And if our words an d our actions come from superficia l human-relations techniques (the \npersonality ethic) rather than from our own inner core (the character ethic), others will sense that \nduplicity.  We simply won't",

The techniques and skills that really make a diffe rence in human interaction are the ones that almost \nnaturally flow from a truly independent character.  So the place to begin building any relationship is \ninside ourselves, inside our Circle of Influenc e, our own character.  As we become independent -- \nproactive, centered in correct principles, value dr iven and able to organize and execute around the \npriorities in our life with integr ity -- we then can choose to beco me interdependent -- capable of \nbuilding rich, enduring, highly producti ve relationships with other people. \n   As we look at the terrai n ahead, we see that we're ente ring a whole new dimension.  \nInterdependence opens up worlds of possibilitie s for deep, rich, meaningful associations, for \ngeometrically increased productivity, for serving, for contributing, for learning, for growing.

    "text": "also where we feel the greatest pain , the greatest frustration, the grea test roadblocks to happiness and \nsuccess.  And we're very aware of that pain because it is acute. \n   We can often live for years with the chronic pain of our lack of vision, lead ership or management in \nour personal lives.  We feel vaguely uneasy and unco mfortable and occasionally take steps to ease the \npain, at least for a time.  But the pain is chro nic, we get used to it, we learn to live with it. \n   But when we have problems in our interactions with other people, we're very aware of acute pain -- \nit's often intense, and we want it to go away.    That's when we try to treat the symptoms with quick fixes and techniques -- the band-aids of the \npersonality ethic.  We don't understand that the acute pain is an outgrowth of the deeper, chronic \nproblem.  And until we stop treati ng the symptoms and start treati ng the problem, our efforts will \nonly bring counterproductive results.  We will only  be successful at obscurin g the chronic pain even \nmore.    Now, as we think of effective interaction with others, let's go back to our earlier definition of \neffectiveness.  We've said it's th e P/PC Balance, the fundamental conc ept in the story of the Goose and \nthe Golden Egg.    In an interdependent situation, the golden e ggs are the effectiveness, the wonderful synergy, the \nresults created by open communication  and positive interaction with ot hers.  And to get those eggs on \na regular basis, we need to take care of the goose.  We need to create and care  for the relationships that \nmake those results realities.    So before we descend from our point of reconna issance and get into Habits 4, 5, and 6, I would like \nto introduce what I believe to be a very powerful me taphor in describing relati onships and in defining \nthe P/PC Balance in an interdependent reality. \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a",

    "text": "also where we feel the greatest pain , the greatest frustration, the grea test roadblocks to happiness and \nsuccess.  And we're very aware of that pain because it is acute. \n   We can often live for years with the chronic pain of our lack of vision, lead ership or management in \nour personal lives.  We feel vaguely uneasy and unco mfortable and occasionally take steps to ease the \npain, at least for a time.  But the pain is chro nic, we get used to it, we learn to live with it. \n   But when we have problems in our interactions with other people, we're very aware of acute pain -- \nit's often intense, and we want it to go away.    That's when we try to treat the symptoms with quick fixes and techniques -- the band-aids of the \npersonality ethic.  We don't understand that the acute pain is an outgrowth of the deeper, chronic \nproblem.  And until we stop treati ng the symptoms and start treati ng the problem, our efforts will \nonly bring counterproductive results.  We will only  be successful at obscurin g the chronic pain even \nmore.    Now, as we think of effective interaction",

Now, as we think of effective interaction with others, let's go back to our earlier definition of \neffectiveness.  We've said it's th e P/PC Balance, the fundamental conc ept in the story of the Goose and \nthe Golden Egg.

And to get those eggs on \na regular basis, we need to take care of the goose.  We need to create and care  for the relationships that \nmake those results realities.    So before we descend from our point of reconna issance and get into Habits 4, 5, and 6, I would like \nto introduce what I believe to be a very powerful me taphor in describing relati onships and in defining \nthe P/PC Balance in an interdependent reality. \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O",

    "text": " r t  \n \nThe Emotional Bank Account TM     We all know what a financial bank account is.  We make deposits into it and build up a reserve \nfrom which we can make withdrawals when we need to.  An Emotional Bank Account is a metaphor \nthat describes the amount of trust that's been built up  in a relationship.  It's the feeling of safeness you \nhave with another human being.    If I make deposits into an Emotional Bank A ccount with you through courtesy, kindness, honesty, \nand keeping my commitments to you, I build up a re serve.  Your trust toward me becomes higher, and \nI can call upon that trust many times if I need to.  I can even make mistakes and that trust level, that emotional reserve, will compensate for it.  My co mmunication may not be clear, but you'll get my \nmeaning anyway.  You won't make me \"an offender for a word.\"  When the trust account is high, \ncommunication is easy, instant, and effective.    But if I have a habit of showing discourtesy, disr espect, cutting you off, ov erreacting, ignoring you, \nbecoming arbitrary, betraying your trust, threatening you, or play ing little tin god in your life, \neventually my Emotional Bank Account is overdrawn.   The trust level gets very low.  Then what \nflexibility do I have?    None.  I'm walking on mine fields.  I have to be very careful of everything I say.  I measure every \nword.  It's tension city, memo heaven.  It's protecting my backside, politicking.  And many \norganizations are filled with it.  Many families are filled with it.  Many marriages are filled with it. \n   If a large reserve of trust is  not sustained by continuing depo sits, a marriage will deteriorate.  \nInstead of rich, spontaneous understanding an d communication, the situation becomes one of \naccommodation, where two people simply attempt to li ve independent life-styles in a fairly respectful \nand tolerant way.  The relationship may further dete riorate to one of hostility and defensiveness.  The \n\"fight or flight\" response creates verbal battles, slammed doors, refusal to talk, emotional withdrawal \nand self-pity.  It may end up in a cold war at home, sustained only by children, sex, and social pressure, \nor image protection.  Or it may en d up in open warfare in the courts , where bitter ego-decimating legal \nbattles can be carried on for years as people endlessly confess the sins of a former spouse. \n   And this is in the most intimate, the most potentially rich, joyful, satisfying and productive \nrelationship possible between two pe ople on this earth.  The P/PC lig hthouse is there; we can either \nbreak ourselves against it or we can use it as a guiding light.    Our most constant relationships, like marriage, require our most constant deposits.  With continuing expectations, old deposits evaporate.  If  you suddenly run into an old high school friend \nyou haven't seen for years, you can pick up right wher e you left off because the earlier deposits are still \nthere.  But your accounts with the people you inte ract with on a regular basis require more constant \ninvestment.  There are sometimes automatic withd rawals in your daily interactions or in their \nperception of you that you don't even  know about.  This is especially  true with teenagers in the home. \n   Suppose you have a teenage son and your normal conversation is something like, \"Clean your room.  \nButton your shirt.  Turn down the radio.  Go ge t a haircut.  And don't forget to take out the \ngarbage!\"  Over a period of time, the withdrawals far exceed the deposits.    Now, suppose this son is in the process of maki ng some important decisions that will affect the rest \nof his life.  But the trust level is so low and th e communication process so  closed, mechanical, and \nunsatisfying that he simply will not be open to  your counsel.  You may have the wisdom and the \nknowledge to help him, but because your account is so overdrawn, he will end up making his decisions \nfrom a short-range emotional perspective, which may well result in many negative long-range \nconsequences.    You need a positive balance to communicate  on these tender issues.  What do you do? \n   What would happen if you started making depo sits into the relationship ?  Maybe the opportunity \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y ",

    "text": " r t  \n \nThe Emotional Bank Account TM     We all know what a financial bank account is.  We make deposits into it and build up a reserve \nfrom which we can make withdrawals when we need to.  An Emotional Bank Account is a metaphor \nthat describes the amount of trust that's been built up  in a relationship.  It's the feeling of safeness you \nhave with another human being.    If I make deposits into an Emotional Bank A ccount with you through courtesy, kindness, honesty, \nand keeping my commitments to you, I build up a re serve.  Your trust toward me becomes higher, and \nI can call upon that trust many times if I need to.  I can even make mistakes and that trust level, that emotional reserve, will compensate for it.  My co mmunication may not be clear, but you'll get my \nmeaning anyway.  You won't make me \"an offender for a word.\"  When the trust account is high, \ncommunication is easy, instant, and effective.    But if I have a habit of showing discourtesy, disr espect, cutting you off, ov erreacting, ignoring you, \nbecoming arbitrary, betraying your trust, threatening you, or play ing little tin god in your life, \neventually my Emotional Bank Account is overdrawn.   The trust level gets very low.  Then what \nflexibility do I have?    None.  I'm walking on mine fields.  I have to be very careful of everything I say.  I measure every \nword.  It's tension city, memo heaven.  It's protecting my backside, politicking.  And many \norganizations are filled with it.  Many families are filled with it.  Many marriages are filled with it. \n   If a large reserve of trust is  not sustained by continuing depo sits, a marriage will deteriorate.  \nInstead of rich, spontaneous understanding an d communication, the situation becomes one of \naccommodation, where two people simply attempt to li ve independent life-styles in a fairly respectful \nand tolerant way.  The relationship may further dete riorate to one of hostility and defensiveness.  The \n\"fight or flight\" response creates verbal battles, slammed doors, refusal to talk, emotional withdrawal \nand self-pity.  It may end up in a cold war at home, sustained only by children, sex, and social pressure, \nor image protection.  Or",

We make deposits into it and build up a reserve \nfrom which we can make withdrawals when we need to.  An Emotional Bank Account is a metaphor \nthat describes the amount of trust that's been built up  in a relationship.  It's the feeling of safeness you \nhave with another human being.    If I make deposits into an Emotional Bank A ccount with you through courtesy, kindness, honesty, \nand keeping my commitments to you, I build up a re serve.  Your trust toward me becomes higher, and \nI can call upon that trust many times if I need to.  I can even make mistakes and that trust level, that emotional reserve, will compensate for it.  My co mmunication may not be clear, but you'll get my \nmeaning anyway.  You won't make me \"an offender for a word.\"  When the trust account is high, \ncommunication is easy, instant, and effective.    But if I have a habit of showing discourtesy, disr espect, cutting you off, ov erreacting, ignoring you, \nbecoming arbitrary, betraying your trust, threatening you, or play",

It may end up in a cold war at home, sustained only by children, sex, and social pressure, \nor image protection.  Or it may en d up in open warfare in the courts , where bitter ego-decimating legal \nbattles can be carried on for years as people endlessly confess the sins of a former spouse. \n   And this is in the most intimate, the most potentially rich, joyful, satisfying and productive \nrelationship possible between two pe ople on this earth.  The P/PC lig hthouse is there; we can either \nbreak ourselves against it or we can use it as a guiding light.    Our most constant relationships, like marriage, require our most constant deposits.  With continuing expectations, old deposits evaporate.  If  you suddenly run into an old high school friend \nyou haven't seen for years, you can pick up right wher e you left off because the earlier deposits are still \nthere.  But your accounts with the people you inte ract with on a regular basis require more constant \ninvestment.  There are sometimes automatic withd rawals in your daily interactions or in their \nperception of you that you don't even  know about.  This is especially  true with teenagers in the home. \n   Suppose you have a teenage son and your normal conversation is something like, \"Clean your room.  \nButton your shirt.  Turn down the radio.  Go ge t a haircut.  And don't forget to take out the \ngarbage!\"  Over a period of time, the withdrawals far exceed the deposits.    Now, suppose this son is in the process of maki ng some important decisions that will affect the rest \nof his life.  But the trust level is so low and th e communication process so  closed, mechanical, and \nunsatisfying that he simply will not be open to  your counsel.  You may have the wisdom and the \nknowledge to help him, but because your account is so overdrawn, he will end up making his decisions \nfrom a short-range emotional perspective, which may well result in many negative long-range \nconsequences.    You need a positive balance to communicate  on these tender issues.  What do you do? \n   What would happen if you started making depo sits into the relationship ?

Perhaps you could invite him \nto go to a movie with you or take him out for some  ice cream.  Probably the most important deposit \nyou could make would be just to listen, with out judging or preaching or reading your own \nautobiography into what he says.  Just listen and s eek to understand.  Let him feel your concern for \nhim, your acceptance of him as a person.    He may not respond at first.  He may even be suspicious.  \"What's Dad up to now?  What \ntechnique is Mom trying on me this time?\"  But as  those genuine deposits keep coming, they begin to \nadd up.  That overdrawn balance is shrinking.    Remember that quick fix is a mirage.  Buildin g and repairing relationsh ips takes time.  If you \nbecome impatient with this apparent lack of respon se of his seeming ingratitude, you may make huge \nwithdrawals and undo all the good you've done.  \"Aft er all we've done for you, the sacrifices we've \nmade, how can you be so ungrateful?  We try to be nice and you act like this.  I can't believe it!    It's hard not to get impatient.  It takes character to  be proactive, to focus on your Circle of Influence, \nto nurture growing things, and not to \"pull up the flowers to see how the roots are coming.\" \n   But there really is no quick fix.  Building an d repairing relationships are long-term investments. \n Six Major Deposits     Let me suggest six major deposits that build the Emotional Bank Account    Understanding the Individual    Really seeking to understand another person is probably one of the most important deposits you can \nmake, and it is the key to every other deposit.  Yo u simply don't know what constitutes a deposit to \nanother person until you understand  that individual.  What might be  a deposit for you -- going for a \nwalk to talk things over, going out for ice cream together, working on a common project -- might not be \nperceived by someone else as a deposit at all.  It mi ght even be perceived as a withdrawal, if it doesn't \ntouch the person's deep interests or needs.    One person's mission is another person's minutia.  To make a deposit, what is important to another \nperson must be as important to yo u as the other person is to you.   You may be working on a high \npriority project when your six-year-ol d child interrupts with something th at seems trivial to you, but it \nmay be very important from his point of view.  It takes Habit 2 to recognize and recommit yourself to the value of that person and Ha bit 3 to subordinate your schedul e to that human priority.  By \naccepting the value he places on what he has to sa y, you show an understanding of him that makes a \ngreat deposit.    I have a friend whose son developed an avid inte rest in baseball.  My friend wasn't interested in \nbaseball at all.  But one summer, he took his son to  see every major league team play one game.  The \ntrip took over six weeks and cost a great deal of money, but it became  a powerful bonding experience in \ntheir relationship.    My friend was asked on his return, \"Do you like baseball that much?\"    \"No,\" he replied, \"but I like my son that much.\"    I have another friend, a college professor, who had a terrible relationship with his teenage son.  \nThis man's entire life was essentially academic, an d he felt his son was totally wasting his life by \nworking with this hands instead of working to develop his mind.  As a result, he was almost \nconstantly on the boy's back, and, in  moments of regret, he would try to  make deposits that just didn't \nwork.  The boy perceived the gestur es as new forms of rejection, co mparison, and judgment, and they \nprecipitated huge withdrawals.  The relationship was turning sour, and it was breaking the father's \nheart.    One day I shared with him this principle of ma king what is important to the other person as \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C",

Perhaps you could invite him \nto go to a movie with you or take him out for some  ice cream.  Probably the most important deposit \nyou could make would be just to listen, with out judging or preaching or reading your own \nautobiography into what he says.  Just listen and s eek to understand.  Let him feel your concern for \nhim, your acceptance of him as a person.    He may not respond at first.  He may even be suspicious.  \"What's Dad up to now?

If you \nbecome impatient with this apparent lack of respon se of his seeming ingratitude, you may make huge \nwithdrawals and undo all the good you've done.  \"Aft er all we've done for you, the sacrifices we've \nmade, how can you be so ungrateful?  We try to be nice and you act like this.  I can't believe it!    It's hard not to get impatient.  It takes character to  be proactive, to focus on your Circle of Influence, \nto nurture growing things, and not to \"pull up the flowers to see how the roots are coming.\" \n   But there really is no quick fix.  Building an d repairing relationships are long-term investments. \n Six Major Deposits     Let me suggest six major deposits that build the Emotional Bank Account    Understanding the Individual    Really seeking to understand another person is probably one of the most important deposits you can \nmake, and it is the key to every other deposit.

Perhaps you could invite him \nto go to a movie with you or take him out for some  ice cream.  Probably the most important deposit \nyou could make would be just to listen, with out judging or preaching or reading your own \nautobiography into what he says.  Just listen and s eek to understand.  Let him feel your concern for \nhim, your acceptance of him as a person.    He may not respond at first.  He may even be suspicious.  \"What's Dad up to now?  What \ntechnique is Mom trying on me this time?\"  But as  those genuine deposits keep coming, they begin to \nadd up.  That overdrawn balance is shrinking.    Remember that quick fix",

    "text": " deposits you can \nmake, and it is the key to every other deposit.  Yo u simply don't know what constitutes a deposit to \nanother person until you understand  that individual.  What might be  a deposit for you -- going for a \nwalk to talk things over, going out for ice cream together, working on a common project -- might not be \nperceived by someone else as a deposit at all.  It mi ght even be perceived as a withdrawal, if it doesn't \ntouch the person's deep interests or needs.    One person's mission is another person's minutia.  To make a deposit, what is important to another \nperson must be as important to yo u as the other person is to you.   You may be working on a high \npriority project when your six-year-ol d child interrupts with something th at seems trivial to you, but it \nmay be very important from his point of view.  It takes Habit 2 to recognize and recommit yourself to the value of that person and Ha bit 3 to subordinate your schedul e to that human priority.  By \naccepting the value he places on what he has to sa y, you show an understanding of him that makes a \ngreat deposit.    I have a friend whose son developed an avid inte rest in baseball.  My friend wasn't interested in \nbaseball at all.  But one summer, he took his son to  see every major league team play one game.  The \ntrip took over six weeks and cost a great deal of money, but it became  a powerful bonding experience in \ntheir relationship.    My friend was asked on his return, \"Do you like baseball that much?\"    \"No,\" he replied, \"but I like my son that much.\"    I have another friend, a college professor, who had a terrible relationship with his teenage son.  \nThis man's entire life was essentially academic, an d he felt his son was totally wasting his life by \nworking with this hands instead of working to develop his mind.  As a result, he was almost \nconstantly on the boy's back, and, in  moments of regret, he would try to  make deposits that just didn't \nwork.  The boy perceived the gestur es as new forms of rejection, co mparison, and judgment, and they \nprecipitated huge withdrawals.  The relationship was turning sour, and it was breaking the father's \nheart.    One day",

The \ntrip took over six weeks and cost a great deal of money, but it became  a powerful bonding experience in \ntheir relationship.    My friend was asked on his return, \"Do you like baseball that much?\"    \"No,\" he replied, \"but I like my son that much.\"    I have another friend, a college professor, who had a terrible relationship with his teenage son.  \nThis man's entire life was essentially academic, an d he felt his son was totally wasting his life by \nworking with this hands instead of working to develop his mind.  As a result, he was almost \nconstantly on the boy's back, and, in  moments of regret, he would try to  make deposits that just didn't \nwork.",

    "text": " I shared with him this principle of ma king what is important to the other person as \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \nimportant to you as the other person is to you.  He  took it deeply to heart.  He engaged his son in a \nproject to build a miniature Wall of  China around their home.  It wa s a consuming project, and they \nworked side by side on it for over a year and a half.    Through that bonding experience, the son moved th rough that phase in his lif e and into an increased \ndesire to develop his mind.  But the real benefit wa s what happened to the re lationship.  Instead of a \nsore spot, it became a source of joy and strength to both father and son. \n   Our tendency is to project ou t of our own autobiographies what we think other people want or need.  \nWe project our intentions on the be havior of others.  We interpret wh at constitutes a deposit based on \nour own needs and desires, either no w or when we were at a similar age or  stage in life.  If they don't \ninterpret our effort as a deposit, ou r tendency is to take it as a rejection of our well-intentioned effort \nand give up.    The Golden Rule says to \"Do unto others as yo u would have others do unto you.\"  While on the \nsurface that could mean to do for them what you would like to have done for you, I think the more \nessential meaning is to understand them deeply as individuals, the way you would want to be \nunderstood, and then to treat them in terms of th at understanding.  As one successful parent said \nabout raising children, \"Treat them all the same by treating them differently.\"  Attending to the Little Things     The little kindnesses and courtesies are so import ant.  Small discourtesies, little unkindnesses, little \nforms of disrespect make large withdrawals.  In relationships, the little things are the big things. \n   I remember an evening I spent with two of my sons some years ago.  It was an organized \nfather-and-son outing, complete with gymnastics, wr estling matches, hot dogs, orangeade, and a movie \n-- the works.    In the middle of the movie, Se an, who was then four years old, fe ll asleep in his seat.  His older \nbrother, Stephen, who was six, stayed awake, and we watched the rest of the movie together.  When it \nwas over, I picked Sean up in my arms, carried him ou t to the car and laid him in the back seat.  It was \nvery cold that night, so I took off my coat  and gently arranged it over and around him. \n   When we arrived home, I quickly carried Sean in and tucked him into bed.  After Stephen put on \nhis \"jammies\" and brushed his teeth, I lay down ne xt to him to talk about the night out together. \n   \"How'd you like it, Stephen?\"    \"Fine,\" he answere\"    \"Did you have fun?\"    \" Y e s . \"     \"What did you like most?\"    \"I don't know.  The trampoline, I guess.\"    \"That was quite a thing, wasn't it -- doing th ose somersaults and tricks in the air like that?\" \n   There wasn't much response on his part.  I found myself making conver sation.  I wondered why \nStephen wouldn't open up more.  He usually did when exciting things happened.  I was a little \ndisappointed.  I sensed something was wrong; he had been so quiet on the way home and getting \nready for bed.    Suddenly Stephen turned over on his side, facing  the wall.  I wondered why and lifted myself up \njust enough to see his eyes welling up with tears.    \"What's wrong, honey?  What is it?\"    He turned back, and I could sense he was feeling some embarrassment for the tears and his \nquivering lips and chin    \"Daddy, if I were cold, would you put your coat around me too?\"    Of all the events of that special night out toge ther, the most important was a little act of kindness -- a \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o",

He  took it deeply to heart.  He engaged his son in a \nproject to build a miniature Wall of  China around their home.  It wa s a consuming project, and they \nworked side by side on it for over a year and a half.    Through that bonding experience, the son moved th rough that phase in his lif e and into an increased \ndesire to develop his mind.  But the real benefit wa s what happened to the re lationship.  Instead of a \nsore spot, it became a source of joy and strength to both father and son. \n   Our tendency is to project ou t of our own autobiographies what we think other people want or need.  \nWe project our intentions on the be havior of others.  We interpret wh at constitutes a deposit based on \nour own needs and desires, either no w or when we were at a similar age or  stage in life.  If they don't \ninterpret our effort as a deposit, ou r tendency is to take it as a rejection of our well-intentioned effort \nand give up.    The Golden Rule says to \"Do unto others as yo u would have others do unto you.\"  While on the \nsurface that could mean to do for them what you would like to have done for you, I think the more \nessential meaning is to understand them deeply as individuals, the way you would want to be \nunderstood, and then to treat them in terms of th at understanding.  As one successful parent said \nabout raising children, \"Treat them all the same by treating them differently.\"  Attending to the Little Things     The little kindnesses and courtesies are so import ant.  Small discourtesies, little unkindnesses, little \nforms of disrespect make large withdrawals.  In relationships, the little things are the big things. \n   I remember an evening I spent with two of my sons some years ago.  It was an organized \nfather-and-son",

We interpret wh at constitutes a deposit based on \nour own needs and desires, either no w or when we were at a similar age or  stage in life.  If they don't \ninterpret our effort as a deposit, ou r tendency is to take it as a rejection of our well-intentioned effort \nand give up.    The Golden Rule says to \"Do unto others as yo u would have others do unto you.\"  While on the \nsurface that could mean to do for them what you would like to have done for you, I think the more \nessential meaning is to understand them deeply as individuals, the way you would want to be \nunderstood, and then to treat them in terms of th at understanding.  As one successful parent said \nabout raising children, \"Treat them all the same by treating them differently.\"  Attending to the Little Things     The little kindnesses and courtesies are so import ant.

It was an organized \nfather-and-son outing, complete with gymnastics, wr estling matches, hot dogs, orangeade, and a movie \n-- the works.    In the middle of the movie, Se an, who was then four years old, fe ll asleep in his seat.  His older \nbrother, Stephen, who was six, stayed awake, and we watched the rest of the movie together.

I sensed something was wrong; he had been so quiet on the way home and getting \nready for bed.    Suddenly Stephen turned over on his side, facing  the wall.  I wondered why and lifted myself up \njust enough to see his eyes welling up with tears.    \"What's wrong, honey?  What is it?\"    He turned back, and I could sense he was feeling some embarrassment for the tears and his \nquivering lips and chin    \"Daddy, if I were cold, would you put your coat around me too?\"    Of all the events of that special night out toge ther, the most important was a little act of kindness -- a \nT H E ",

People are very \ntender, very sensitive inside.  I don't believe age or  experience makes much difference.  Inside, even \nwithin the most toughened and calloused exteriors, are the tender feelings and emotions of the heart. \n Keeping Commitments     Keeping a commitment or a promise is a major depo sit; breaking one is a ma jor withdrawal.  In fact, \nthere's probably not a more massive withdrawal than  to make a promise that's important to someone \nand then not to come through.  The next time a prom ise is made, they won't believe it.  People tend to \nbuild their hopes around promises, particularly promises about their basic livelihood.    I've tried to adopt a philosophy as a parent neve r to make a promise I don't keep.  I therefore try to \nmake them very carefully, very sparingly, and to be  aware of as many variables and contingencies as \npossible so that something doesn't suddenly come up to keep me from fulfilling it. \n   Occasionally, despite all my effort, the unexpe cted does come up, creating a situation where it \nwould be unwise or impossible to keep a promise I've made.  But I value that promise.  I either keep it \nanyway, or explain the situation thoroughly to the person involved and ask to be released from the \npromise.    I believe that if you cultivate the habit of al ways keeping the promises you make, you build bridges \nof trust that span the gaps of understanding bet ween you and your child.  Then, when your child \nwants to do something you don't want him to do, and out of your maturity you can see consequences that the child cannot see, you can say, \"Son, if you do this, I promise you that this will be the result.\"  If \nthat child has cultivated trust in your word, in  your promises, he will act on your counsel. \n Clarifying Expectations     Imagine the difficulty you might encounter if you and your boss had different assumptions \nregarding whose role it was to create your job description.    \"When am I going to get my job description?\" you might ask. \n   \"I've been waiting for you to bring one to me so that we could discuss it,\" your boss might reply. \n   \"I thought defining my job was your role.\"    \"That's not my role at all.  Don't you remember?  Right from the first, I said that how you do in the \njob largely depends on you.\"    \"I thought you meant that the quality of my jo b depended on me.  But I don't even know what my \njob really is.\"    \"I did exactly what you asked me to do and here is the report.\"    \"I don't want a report.  The goals was to solve the problem -- not to analyze it and report on it.\" \n   \"I thought the goal was to get a handle on th e problem so we could delegate it to someone else.\" \n   How many times have we had these kinds of conversations?    \"You said...\"    \"No, you're wrong! I said...\"    \"You did not! You never said I was supposed to...\"    \"Oh, yes I did! I clearly said...\"    \"You never even mentioned...\"    \"But that was our agreement...\"    The cause of almost all relationship difficulties is rooted in conflicting or ambiguous expectations \naround roles and goals.  Whether we are dealing with  the question of who does what at work, how \nyou communicate with your daughter  when you tell her to clean her room, or who feeds the fish and \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \ntakes out the garbage, we can be certain that unclear expectations will lead to misunderstanding, \ndisappointment, and withdrawals of trust.    Many expectations are implicit.  They haven't been explicitly stated or announced, but people nevertheless bring them to a particular situation.  In marriage, for example, a man and a woman have implicit expectations of each othe r in their marriage roles.  Although  these expectations have not been \ndiscussed, or sometimes even recognized by the",

People are very \ntender, very sensitive inside.  I don't believe age or  experience makes much difference.  Inside, even \nwithin the most toughened and calloused exteriors, are the tender feelings and emotions of the heart. \n Keeping Commitments     Keeping a commitment or a promise is a major depo sit; breaking one is a ma jor withdrawal.  In fact, \nthere's probably not a more massive withdrawal than  to make a promise that's important to someone \nand then not to come through.  The next time a prom ise is made, they won't believe it.  People tend to \nbuild their hopes around promises, particularly promises about their basic livelihood.    I've tried to adopt a philosophy as a parent neve r to make a promise I don't keep.  I therefore try to \nmake them very carefully, very sparingly, and to be  aware of as many variables and contingencies as \npossible so that something doesn't suddenly come up to keep me from fulfilling it. \n   Occasionally, despite all my effort, the unexpe cted does come up, creating a situation where it \nwould be unwise or impossible to keep a promise I've made.  But I value that promise.  I either keep it \nanyway, or explain the situation thoroughly to the person involved and ask to be released from the \npromise.    I believe that if you cultivate the habit of al ways keeping the promises you make, you build bridges \nof trust that span the gaps of understanding bet ween you and your child.  Then, when your child \nwants to do something you don't want him to do, and out of your maturity you can see consequences that the child cannot see, you can say, \"Son, if you do this, I promise you that this will be the result.\"  If \nthat child has cultivated trust in your word, in  your promises, he will act on your counsel. \n Clarifying Expectations     Imagine the difficulty",

    "text": " bring them to a particular situation.  In marriage, for example, a man and a woman have implicit expectations of each othe r in their marriage roles.  Although  these expectations have not been \ndiscussed, or sometimes even recognized by the person who has them, fulfilling them makes great \ndeposits in the relationship and violating them makes withdrawals. \n   That's why it's so important wh enever you  come into a new situation to get all the expectations out \non the table.  People will begin to judge each other through those expectations.  And if they feel like \ntheir basic expectations have been violated, the re serve of trust is diminished.  We create many \nnegative situations by simply assuming that our expe ctations are self-evident and that they are clearly \nunderstood and shared by other people.    The deposit is to make the expectations clear and explicit in the beginning.  This takes a real \ninvestment of time and effort up front, but it save s great amounts of time and effort down the road.  \nWhen expectations are not clear and shared, people begin to become emotionally involved and simple \nmisunderstandings become compounded, turning into personality clashes and communication \nbreakdowns.    Clarifying expectations sometimes takes a great deal  of courage.  It seems easier to act as though \ndifferences don't exist and to hope things will work out than it is to face the differences and work \ntogether to arrive at a mutually agreeable set of expectations.  Showing Personal Integrity     Personal integrity generates trust and is th e basis of many different kinds of deposits. \n   Lack of integrity can undermine almost any othe r effort to create high trust accounts.  People can \nseek to understand, remember the little things, keep  their promises, clarify and fulfill expectations, and \nstill fail to build reserves of trust if they are inwardly duplicitous. \n   Integrity includes but goes beyond honesty.   Honesty is telling the truth -- in other words, \nconforming our words to reality.  Integrity is co nforming reality to our words -- in other words, \nkeeping promises and fulfilling expectations.  This  requires an integrated character, a oneness, \nprimarily with self but also with life.    One of the most important ways to manifest integr ity is to be loyal to those who are not present.  In \ndoing so, we build the trust of th ose who are present.  When you defend those who are absent, you \nretain the trust of those present.    Suppose you and I were talking alone, and we we re criticizing our supervisor in a way that we \nwould not dare to if he were presen t.  Now what will happen when yo u and I have a falling out?  You \nknow I'm going to be discussing your weaknesses with someone else.  That 's what you and I did \nbehind our supervisor's back.  You know my nature .  I'll sweet-talk you to your face and bad-mouth \nyou behind your back.  You've seen me do it.    That's the essence of duplicity.  Does that build a reserve of trust in my account with you. \n   On the other hand, suppose you were to start cr iticizing our supervisor and I basically told you I \nagree with the content of some of the criticism and suggest that the two of us go directly to him and \nmake an effective presentation of how things might be improved .  Then what would you know I \nwould do if someone were to criticize you to me behind your back?    For another example, suppose in my effort to build a relationship with you, I told you something \nsomeone else had shared with me in confidence.  \"I really shouldn't tell you this,\"  I might say, \"but \nsince you're my friend...\"  Would my betraying anothe r person build my trust account with you?  Or \nwould you wonder if the things you had told me  in confidence were being shared with others? \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n   Such duplicity might appear to be making a depo sit with the person you're wi th, but it is actually a \nwithdrawal because you communicat e your own lack of integrity.  You may get the golden egg of \ntemporary pleasure from putting someone down or sharing privileged information, but you're \nstrangling the goose, weakening the relationship th at provides enduring pleasure in association. \n   Integrity in an interdependent reality is simply th is: you treat everyone by the same set of principles.  \nAs you do, people will come to trust you.  They ma y not at first appreciate the",

Although  these expectations have not been \ndiscussed, or sometimes even recognized by the person who has them, fulfilling them makes great \ndeposits in the relationship and violating them makes withdrawals. \n   That's why it's so important wh enever you  come into a new situation to get all the expectations out \non the table.  People will begin to judge each other through those expectations.  And if they feel like \ntheir basic expectations have been violated, the re serve of trust is diminished.  We create many \nnegative situations by simply assuming that our expe ctations are self-evident and that they are clearly \nunderstood and shared by other people.    The deposit is to make the expectations clear and explicit in the beginning.  This takes a real \ninvestment of time and effort up front, but it save s great amounts of time and effort down the road.  \nWhen expectations are not clear and shared, people begin to become emotionally involved and simple \nmisunderstandings become compounded, turning into personality clashes and communication \nbreakdowns.    Clarifying expectations sometimes takes a great deal  of courage.  It seems easier to act as though \ndifferences don't exist and to hope things will work out than it is to face the differences and work \ntogether to arrive at a mutually agreeable set of expectations.  Showing Personal Integrity     Personal integrity generates trust and is th e basis of many different kinds of deposits. \n   Lack of integrity can undermine almost any othe r effort to create high trust accounts.  People can \nseek to understand, remember the little things, keep  their promises, clarify and fulfill expectations, and \nstill fail to build reserves of trust if they are inwardly duplicitous. \n   Integrity includes but goes beyond honesty.   Honesty is telling the truth -- in other words, \nconforming our words to reality.  Integrity is co nforming reality to our words -- in other words, \nkeeping promises and fulfilling expectations.  This  requires an integrated character, a oneness, \nprimarily with self but also with life.    One of the most important ways to manifest integr ity is to be loyal to those who are not present.  In \ndoing so, we build the trust of th ose who are present.  When you defend those who are absent, you",

Although  these expectations have not been \ndiscussed, or sometimes even recognized by the person who has them, fulfilling them makes great \ndeposits in the relationship and violating them makes withdrawals. \n   That's why it's so important wh enever you  come into a new situation to get all the expectations out \non the table.  People will begin to judge each other through those expectations.  And if they feel like \ntheir basic expectations have been violated, the re serve of trust is diminished.  We create many \nnegative situations by simply assuming that our expe ctations are self-evident and that they are clearly \nunderstood and shared by other people.    The deposit is to make the expectations clear and explicit in the beginning.  This takes a real \ninvestment of time and effort up front, but it save s great amounts of time and effort down the road.  \nWhen expectations are not clear and shared, people begin to become emotionally involved and simple \nmisunderstandings become compounded, turning into personality clashes and communication \nbreakdowns.    Clarifying expectations sometimes takes",

    "text": " of time and effort down the road.  \nWhen expectations are not clear and shared, people begin to become emotionally involved and simple \nmisunderstandings become compounded, turning into personality clashes and communication \nbreakdowns.    Clarifying expectations sometimes takes a great deal  of courage.  It seems easier to act as though \ndifferences don't exist and to hope things will work out than it is to face the differences and work \ntogether to arrive at a mutually agreeable set of expectations.  Showing Personal Integrity     Personal integrity generates trust and is th e basis of many different kinds of deposits. \n   Lack of integrity can undermine almost any othe r effort to create high trust accounts.  People can \nseek to understand, remember the little things, keep  their promises, clarify and fulfill expectations, and \nstill fail to build reserves of trust if they are inwardly duplicitous. \n   Integrity includes but goes beyond honesty.   Honesty is telling the truth -- in other words, \nconforming our words to reality.  Integrity is co nforming reality to our words -- in other words, \nkeeping promises and fulfilling expectations.  This  requires an integrated character, a oneness, \nprimarily with self but also with life.   ",

When you defend those who are absent, you \nretain the trust of those present.    Suppose you and I were talking alone, and we we re criticizing our supervisor in a way that we \nwould not dare to if he were presen t.  Now what will happen when yo u and I have a falling out?  You \nknow I'm going to be discussing your weaknesses with someone else.  That 's what you and I did \nbehind our supervisor's back.  You know my nature .  I'll sweet-talk you to your face and bad-mouth \nyou behind your back.  You've seen me do it.    That's the essence of duplicity.  Does that build a reserve of trust in my account with you. \n   On the other hand, suppose you were to start cr iticizing our supervisor and I basically told you I \nagree with the content of some of the criticism and suggest that the two of us go directly to him and \nmake an effective presentation of how things might be improved .  Then what would you know I \nwould do if someone were to criticize you to me behind your back?    For another example, suppose in my effort to build a relationship with you, I told you something \nsomeone else had shared with me in confidence.  \"I really shouldn't tell you this,\"  I might say, \"but \nsince you're my friend...\"  Would my betraying anothe r person build my trust account with you?  Or \nwould you wonder if the things you had told me  in confidence were being shared with others? \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n   Such duplicity might appear to be making a depo sit with the person you're wi th, but it is actually a \nwithdrawal because you communicat e your own lack of integrity.

    "text": " provides enduring pleasure in association. \n   Integrity in an interdependent reality is simply th is: you treat everyone by the same set of principles.  \nAs you do, people will come to trust you.  They ma y not at first appreciate the honest confrontational \nexperiences such integrity might generate.  Conf rontation takes considerable courage, and many \npeople would prefer to take the course of leas t resistance, belittling an d criticizing, betraying \nconfidences, or participating in go ssip about others behind their backs.  But in the long run, people \nwill trust and respect you if you are honest and op en and kind with them.  You care enough to \nconfront.  And to be trusted, it is said, is greater than  to be loved.  In the long run, I am convinced, to \nbe trusted will be also mean to be loved.    When my son Joshua was quite young, he woul d frequently ask me a soul-searching question.  \nWhenever I overreacted to someone else or was the le ast bit impatient or unkind, he was so vulnerable \nand so honest and our relationship was so good that he would simply look me in the eye and say, \"Dad, \ndo you love me?\"  If he thought I was breaking a basic principle of life toward someone else, he wondered if I wouldn't break it with him.    As a teacher, as well as a parent, I have found th at the key to the ninety-nin e is the one -- particularly \nthe one that is testing the patience and the good humo r of the many.  It is the love and the discipline of \nthe one student, the one child, that communicates love  for the others.  It's how you treat the one that \nreveals how you regard the ninety-nine, be cause everyone is ultimately a one. \n   Integrity also means avoiding any communication  that is deceptive, full of guile, or beneath the \ndignity of people.  \"A lie is any communication with intent to deceive,\" according to one definition of \nthe word.  Whether we communicate with words or be havior, if we have integrity, our intent cannot \nbe to deceive.  Apologizing Sincerely When  You Make a Withdrawal \n    When we make withdrawals fr om the Emotional Bank Account, we need to apologize and we need \nto do it sincerely.  Great deposits come in the sincere words    \"I was wrong.\"    \"That was unkind of me.\"    \"I showed you no respect.\"    \"I gave you no dignity, and I'm deeply sorry.\"    \"I embarrassed you in front of your friends and I had no call to do that.  Even though I wanted to \nmake a point, I never should have done it.  I apologize.\"    It takes a great deal of character strength to ap ologize quickly out of one' s heart rather than out of \npity.  A person must possess himself and have a de ep sense of security in fun damental principles and \nvalues in order to genuinely apologize.    People with little internal security can't do it.  It makes them too vulnerable.  They feel it makes \nthem appear soft and weak, and they fear that othe rs will take advantage of their weakness.  Their \nsecurity is based on the opinions of  other people, and they worry abou t what others might think.  In \naddition, they usually feel justified in what they di d.  They rationalize their own wrong in the name of \nthe other person's wrong, and if they apologize at all, it's superficial.    \"If you're going to bow, bow low,\" say Eastern wisdom.  \"Pay the uttermost farthing,\" says the \nChristian ethic.  To be a deposit, an apology must be sincere.  And it must be perceived as sincere. \n   Leo Roskin taught, \"It is the weak who are cruel.   Gentleness can only be expected from the strong. \n \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n   I was in my office at home one afternoon writing,  of all things, on the subj ect of patience.  I could \nhear the boys running up and down the hall making  loud banging noises, and I could feel my own \npatience beginning to wane.    Suddenly, my son David started pounding on the bathroom door, yelling at the top of his lungs, \"Let \nme in! Let me in!\"    I rushed out of the office and spoke to him with great intensity.  \"David, do you have any idea how",

    "text": " provides enduring pleasure in association. \n   Integrity in an interdependent reality is simply th is: you treat everyone by the same set of principles.  \nAs you do, people will come to trust you.  They ma y not at first appreciate the honest confrontational \nexperiences such integrity might generate.  Conf rontation takes considerable courage, and many \npeople would prefer to take the course of leas t resistance, belittling an d criticizing, betraying \nconfidences, or participating in go ssip about others behind their backs.  But in the long run, people \nwill trust and respect you if you are honest and op en and kind with them.  You care enough to \nconfront.  And to be trusted, it is said, is greater than  to be loved.  In the long run, I am convinced, to \nbe trusted will be also mean to be loved.    When my son Joshua was quite young, he woul d frequently ask me a soul-searching question.  \nWhenever I overreacted to someone else or was the le ast bit impatient or unkind, he was so vulnerable \nand so honest and our relationship was so good that he would simply look me in the eye and say, \"Dad, \ndo you love me?\"  If he thought I was breaking a basic principle of life toward someone else, he wondered if I wouldn't break it with him.    As a teacher, as well as a parent, I have found th at the key to the ninety-nin e is the one -- particularly \nthe one that is testing the patience and the good humo r of the many.  It is the love and the discipline of \nthe one student, the one child, that communicates love  for the others.  It's how you treat the one that \nreveals how you regard the ninety-nine, be cause everyone is ultimately a one. \n   Integrity also means avoiding any communication  that is deceptive, full of guile, or beneath the \ndignity of people.  \"A lie is any communication with intent to deceive,\" according to one definition of \nthe word.  Whether we communicate with words or be havior, if we have integrity, our intent cannot \nbe to deceive.  Apologizing Sincerely When  You Make a Withdrawal \n    When we make withdrawals fr om the Emotional Bank Account, we need to apologize and we need \nto do it sincerely.  Great deposits come in the sincere words   ",

    "text": " deceive.  Apologizing Sincerely When  You Make a Withdrawal \n    When we make withdrawals fr om the Emotional Bank Account, we need to apologize and we need \nto do it sincerely.  Great deposits come in the sincere words    \"I was wrong.\"    \"That was unkind of me.\"    \"I showed you no respect.\"    \"I gave you no dignity, and I'm deeply sorry.\"    \"I embarrassed you in front of your friends and I had no call to do that.  Even though I wanted to \nmake a point, I never should have done it.  I apologize.\"    It takes a great deal of character strength to ap ologize quickly out of one' s heart rather than out of \npity.  A person must possess himself and have a de ep sense of security in fun damental principles and \nvalues in order to genuinely apologize.    People with little internal security can't do it.  It makes them too vulnerable.  They feel it makes \nthem appear soft and weak, and they fear that othe rs will take advantage of their weakness.  Their \nsecurity is based on the opinions of  other people, and they worry abou t what others might think.  In \naddition, they usually feel justified in what they di d.  They rationalize their own wrong in the name of \nthe other person's wrong, and if they apologize at all, it's superficial.    \"If you're going to bow, bow low,\" say Eastern wisdom.  \"Pay the uttermost farthing,\" says the \nChristian ethic.  To be a deposit, an apology must be sincere.  And it must be perceived as sincere. \n   Leo Roskin taught, \"It is the weak who are cruel.   Gentleness can only be expected from the strong. \n \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n   I was in my office at home one afternoon writing,  of all things, on the subj ect of patience.  I could \nhear the boys running up and down the hall making  loud banging noises, and I could feel my own \npatience beginning to wane.    Suddenly, my son David",

    "text": " started pounding on the bathroom door, yelling at the top of his lungs, \"Let \nme in! Let me in!\"    I rushed out of the office and spoke to him with great intensity.  \"David, do you have any idea how \ndisturbing that is to me?  Do you know how hard it  is to try to concentrate and write creatively?  Now \nyou go into your room and stay in  there until you can behave yourself.\"  So in he went, dejected, and \nshut the door.    As I turned around, I became aware of another problem.  The boys had been playing tackle football \nin the four-foot-wide hallway, and on e of them had been elbowed in th e mouth.  He was lying there in \nthe hall, bleeding from the mouth.  David, I discove red, had gone to the bathroom to get a wet towel \nfor him.  But his sister, Maria, who was ta king a shower, wouldn't open the door. \n   When I realized that I ha d completely misinterpreted the situation and had overreacted, I \nimmediately went in to apologize to David.    As I opened the door, the first thing he said to me was, \"I won't forgive you.\"    \"Well, why not, honey?\" I replied.  \"Honestly, I didn't realize you were trying to help your brother.  \nWhy won't you forgive me?\"    \"Because you did the same thing last week,\" he replied.  In other words, he was saying.  \"Dad, \nyou're overdrawn, and you're not going to talk your way out of a problem you behaved yourself into.\" \n   Sincere apologies make deposits; repeated apol ogies interpreted as insincere make withdrawals.  \nAnd the quality of the relationship reflects it.    It is one thing to make a mistake, and quit e another thing not to admit it.  People will forgive \nmistakes, because mistakes are usually of the mind, mistakes of judgment.  Bu t people will not easily \nforgive the mistakes of the heart, the ill intention, th e bad motives, the prideful justifying cover-up of \nthe first mistake.  The Laws of Love and the Laws of Life     When we make deposits of unconditional love, when we live the primary laws of love, we \nencourage others to live the primary  laws of life.  In other words, when we truly love others without \ncondition, without strings, we help them feel secu re and safe and validated and affirmed in their \nessential worth, identity, and integrity.  Their na tural growth process is encouraged.  We make it \neasier for them to live the laws of life -- cooperatio n, contribution, self-discipline, integrity -- and to \ndiscover and live true to the highest and best within them.  We give them the freedom to act on their \nown inner imperatives rather than react to our cond itions and limitations.  This does not mean we \nbecome permissive or soft.  That itself is a massi ve withdrawal.  We counsel, we plead, we set limits \nand consequences.  But we love, regardless.    When we violate the primary laws of love -- when we attach strings and condit ions to that gift -- we \nactually encourage others to violate the primary laws  of life.  We put them in a reactive, defensive \nposition where they feel they have to prove \"I matter as a person, independent of you.\"    In reality, they aren't independent.  They  are counter-dependent, wh ich is another form of \ndependency and is at the lowest end of the Matu rity Continuum.  They become reactive, almost \nenemy-centered, more concerned about defending th eir \"rights\" and producing evidence of their \nindividuality than they are about proactively liste ning to and honoring th eir own inner imperatives. \n   Rebellion is a knot of the heart, not of the mind.  The key is to make deposits -- constant deposits of \nunconditional love.  \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n   I once had a friend who was dean of a very pr estigious school.  He planned and saved for years to \nprovide his son the opportunity to attend that instit ution, but when the time came, the boy refused to \ngo.    This deeply concerned his father.  Graduating from that particular school would have been a great \nasset to the boy.  Besides, it was a family tradition.   Three generations of attendance preceded the boy.  \nThe father pleaded",

Let me in!\"    I rushed out of the office and spoke to him with great intensity.  \"David, do you have any idea how \ndisturbing that is to me?  Do you know how hard it  is to try to concentrate and write creatively?  Now \nyou go into your room and stay in  there until you can behave yourself.\"  So in he went, dejected, and \nshut the door.    As I turned around, I became aware of another problem.  The boys had been playing tackle football \nin the four-foot-wide hallway, and on e of them had been elbowed in th e mouth.  He was lying there in \nthe hall, bleeding from the mouth.  David, I discove red, had gone to the bathroom to get a wet towel \nfor him.  But his sister, Maria, who was ta king a shower, wouldn't open the door. \n   When I realized that I ha d completely misinterpreted the situation and had overreacted, I \nimmediately went in to apologize to David.    As I opened the door, the first thing he said to me was, \"I won't forgive you.\"    \"Well, why not, honey?\" I replied.  \"Honestly, I didn't realize you were trying to help your brother.  \nWhy won't you forgive me?\"    \"Because you did the same thing last week,\" he replied.  In other words, he was saying.  \"Dad, \nyou're overdrawn, and you're not going to talk your way out of a problem you behaved yourself into.\" \n   Sincere apologies make deposits; repeated apol ogies interpreted as insincere make withdrawals.  \nAnd the quality of the relationship reflects it.    It is one thing to make a mistake, and quit e another thing not to admit it.  People will forgive \nmistakes, because mistakes are usually of the mind, mistakes of judgment.  Bu t people will not easily \nforgive the mistakes of the heart, the ill intention, th e bad motives, the prideful justifying cover-up of \nthe first mistake.  The Laws of Love and the Laws of Life     When we make deposits of unconditional love, when we live the primary laws of love, we \nencourage others to live the primary  laws of life.  In other words,",

The Laws of Love and the Laws of Life     When we make deposits of unconditional love, when we live the primary laws of love, we \nencourage others to live the primary  laws of life.  In other words, when we truly love others without \ncondition, without strings, we help them feel secu re and safe and validated and affirmed in their \nessential worth, identity, and integrity.  Their na tural growth process is encouraged.  We make it \neasier for them to live the laws of life -- cooperatio n, contribution, self-discipline, integrity -- and to \ndiscover and live true to the highest and best within them.  We give them the freedom to act on their \nown inner imperatives rather than react to our cond itions and limitations.  This does not mean we \nbecome permissive or soft.  That itself is a massi ve withdrawal.  We counsel, we plead, we set limits \nand consequences.  But we love, regardless.    When we violate the primary laws of love -- when we attach strings and condit ions to that gift -- we \nactually encourage others to violate the primary laws  of life.  We put them in a reactive, defensive \nposition where they feel they have to prove \"I matter as a person, independent of you.\"    In reality, they aren't independent.  They  are counter-dependent, wh ich is another form of \ndependency and is at the lowest end of the Matu rity Continuum.  They become reactive, almost \nenemy-centered, more concerned about defending th eir \"rights\" and producing evidence of their \nindividuality than they are about proactively liste ning to and honoring th eir own inner imperatives. \n   Rebellion is a knot of the heart, not of the mind.  The key is to make deposits -- constant deposits of \nunconditional love.  \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n   I once had a friend who was dean of a very pr estigious school.

When we violate the primary laws of love -- when we attach strings and condit ions to that gift -- we \nactually encourage others to violate the primary laws  of life.  We put them in a reactive, defensive \nposition where they feel they have to prove \"I matter as a person, independent of you.\"    In reality, they aren't independent.  They  are counter-dependent, wh ich is another form of \ndependency and is at the lowest end of the Matu rity Continuum.  They become reactive, almost \nenemy-centered, more concerned about defending th eir \"rights\" and producing evidence of their \nindividuality than they are about proactively liste ning to and honoring th eir own inner imperatives. \n   Rebellion is a knot of the heart, not of the mind.  The key is to make deposits -- constant deposits of \nunconditional love.  \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r",

Three generations of attendance preceded the boy.  \nThe father pleaded and urged and talked.  He also trie d to listen to the boy to understand him, all the \nwhile hoping that the so n would change his mind. \n   The subtle message being communicated was one of  conditional love.  The son felt that in a sense \nthe father's desire for him to atte nd the school outweighed the value he placed on him as a person and \nas a son, which was terribly threatening.  Conseque ntly, he fought for and with his own identity and \nintegrity, and he increased his resolve and his efforts to rationalize his decision not to go. \n   After some intense soul-searching, the father de cided to make a sacrifice -- to renounce conditional \nlove.  He knew that his son might choose differently than he had wished; nevertheless, he and his wife \nresolved to love their son unconditionally, regardless of his choice.  It was an extremely difficult thing \nto do because the value of his educational experien ce was so close to their hearts and because it was \nsomething they had planned and worked for since his birth. \n   The father and mother went th rough a very difficult rescriptin g process, struggling to really \nunderstand the nature of unconditional love.  Th ey communicated to the boy what they were doing \nand why, and told him that they had come to the po int at which they could sa y in all honesty that his \ndecision would not affect their complete feeling of un conditional love toward him.  They didn't do this \nto manipulate him, to try to get him to \"shape up.\"  They did it as the logical extension of their growth \nand character.    The boy didn't give much of  a response at the time, but his parents had such a paradigm of \nunconditional love at that point that it would have made no difference in their feelings for him.  About \na week later, he told his parents th at he had decided not to go.  They were perfectly prepared for his \nresponse and continued to show unconditional lo ve for him.  Everything was settled and life went \nalong normally.    A short time later, an interesting thing happened.  Now that the boy no longer felt he had to defend \nhis position, he searched within himself more deeply and found that he really did want to have this \neducational experience.  He applied for admission, and then he told his fa ther, who again showed \nunconditional love by fully accepting his son's deci sion.  My friend was happy, but not excessively so, \nbecause he had truly learned to love without condition.    Dag Hammarskjold, past Secretary-General of  the United Nations, once made a profound, \nfar-reaching statement:  \"It is more noble to give yourself completely to one individual than to labor \ndiligently for the salvation of the masses.\"    I take that to mean that I could devote eight, te n, or twelve hours a day, five, six, or seven days a \nweek to the thousands of people and projects \"o ut there\" and still not have a deep, meaningful \nrelationship with my own spouse, with my own teen age son, with my closest working associate.  And \nit would take more nobility of character -- more hum ility, courage, and strength -- to rebuild that one \nrelationship than it would to continue putting in  all those hours for all those people and causes. \n   In 25 years of consulting with organizations, I have been impressed over and over again by the \npower of that statement.  Many of the problems in organizations stem from relationship difficulties at \nthe very top -- between two partners in a comp any, between the president and an executive \nvice-president.  It truly takes more nobility of charac ter to confront and resolve those issues than it \ndoes to continue to diligently work for the many projects and people \"out there.\" \n   When I first came across Hammarskjold's statem ent, I was working in an organization where there \nwere unclear expectations between the individual wh o was my right-hand man and myself.  I simply \ndid not have the courage to confro nt our differences regarding role and goal expectations and values, \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \nparticularly in our methods of administration.  So I worked for a number of months in a compromise \nmode to avoid what might turn out to be an ugly",

Three generations of attendance preceded the boy.  \nThe father pleaded and urged and talked.  He also trie d to listen to the boy to understand him, all the \nwhile hoping that the so n would change his mind. \n   The subtle message being communicated was one of  conditional love.  The son felt that in a sense \nthe father's desire for him to atte nd the school outweighed the value he placed on him as a person and \nas a son, which was terribly threatening.  Conseque ntly, he fought for and with his own identity and \nintegrity, and he increased his resolve and his efforts to rationalize his decision not to go. \n   After some intense soul-searching, the father de cided to make a sacrifice -- to renounce conditional \nlove.  He knew that his son might choose differently than he had wished; nevertheless, he and his wife \nresolved to love their son unconditionally, regardless of his choice.  It was an extremely difficult thing \nto do because the value of his educational experien ce was so close to their hearts and because it was \nsomething they had planned and worked for since his birth. \n   The father and mother went th rough a very difficult rescriptin g process, struggling to really \nunderstand the nature of unconditional love.

Th ey communicated to the boy what they were doing \nand why, and told him that they had come to the po int at which they could sa y in all honesty that his \ndecision would not affect their complete feeling of un conditional love toward him.  They didn't do this \nto manipulate him, to try to get him to \"shape up.\"  They did it as the logical extension of their growth \nand character.

Now that the boy no longer felt he had to defend \nhis position, he searched within himself more deeply and found that he really did want to have this \neducational experience.  He applied for admission, and then he told his fa ther, who again showed \nunconditional love by fully accepting his son's deci sion.  My friend was happy, but not excessively so, \nbecause he had truly learned to love without condition.    Dag Hammarskjold, past Secretary-General of  the United Nations, once made a profound, \nfar-reaching statement:  \"It is more noble to give yourself completely to one individual than to labor \ndiligently for the salvation of the masses.\"    I take that to mean that I could devote eight, te n, or twelve hours a day, five, six, or seven days a \nweek to the thousands of people and projects \"o ut there\" and still not have a deep, meaningful \nrelationship with my own spouse, with my own teen age son, with my closest working associate.  And \nit would take more nobility of character -- more hum ility, courage, and strength -- to rebuild that one \nrelationship than it would to continue putting in  all those hours for all those people and causes. \n   In 25 years of consulting with organizations, I have been impressed over and over again by the \npower of that statement.  Many of the problems in organizations stem from relationship difficulties at \nthe very top -- between two partners in a comp any, between the president and an executive \nvice-president.  It truly takes more nobility of charac ter to confront and resolve those issues than it \ndoes to continue to diligently work for the many projects and people \"out there.\" \n   When I first came across Hammarskjold's statem ent, I was working in an organization where there \nwere unclear expectations between the individual wh o was my right-hand man and myself.  I simply \ndid not have the courage to confro nt our differences regarding role and goal expectations and values, \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t ",

So I worked for a number of months in a compromise \nmode to avoid what might turn out to be an ugly  confrontation.  All the while, bad feelings were \ndeveloping inside both of us.    After reading that it is more noble to give yo urself completely to one individual than to labor \ndiligently for the salvation of the masses, I was d eeply affected by the idea of rebuilding that \nrelationship.    I had to steel myself for what lay ahead, because I knew it would be hard to really get the issues out \nand to achieve a deep, common understanding and commitment.  I remember actually shaking in \nanticipation of the visit.  He seemed like such a h ard man, so set in his own ways and so right in his \nown eyes; yet I needed his strengths and abilities.  I was afraid a confrontation might jeopardize the \nrelationship and result in my losing those strengths.    I went through a mental dress rehearsal of the an ticipated visit, and I finally became settled within \nmyself around the principles rather than  the practices of what I was going to do and say.  At last I felt \npeace of mind and the courag e to have the communication. \n   When we met together, to my total surprise, I di scovered that this man had been going through the \nvery same process and had been longing for such  a conversation.  He was anything but hard and \ndefensive.    Nevertheless, our administrative styles were co nsiderably different, and th e entire organization was \nresponding to these differences.  We both acknowle dged the problems that our disunity had created.  \nOver several visits, we were able to confront the deeper  issues, to get them all out on the table, and to \nresolve them, one by one, with a spirit of high mu tual respect.  We were able to develop a powerful \ncomplementary team and a deep personal affection which added tremendously to our ability to work \neffectively together.    Creating the unity necessary to run an effectiv e business or a family or a marriage requires great \npersonal strength and courage.  No amount of tec hnical administrative skill in laboring for the masses \ncan make up for lack of nobility of personal characte r in developing relationships.  It is at a very \nessential, one-on-one level, that we liv e the primary laws of love and life. \n P Problems are PC Opportunities     This experience also taught me another powerful  paradigm of interdependence.  It deals with the \nway in which we see problems.  I had lived for months  t r y i n g  t o  a v o i d  t h e  p r o b l e m ,  s e e i n g  i t  a s  a  \nsource of irritation, a stumbling block, and wishing it  would somehow go away.  But, as it turned out, \nthe very problem created the opportunity to build a deep relationship that empowered us to work \ntogether as a strong complementary team.    I suggest that in an interdependent situation,  every P problem is a PC o pportunity -- a chance to \nbuild the Emotional Bank Accounts that sign ificantly affect interdependent production. \n   When parents see their children's problems as op portunities to build the relationship instead of as \nnegative, burdensome irritations, it totally changes the nature of  parent-child interaction.  Parents \nbecome more willing, even excited, about deeply understanding and helping their children.  When a \nchild comes to them with a problem, instead of  thinking, \"Oh, no! Not another problem!\" their \nparadigm is, \"Here is a great opportunity for me to  really help my child and to invest in our \nrelationship.\"  Many interactions change from tran sactional to transformation al, and strong bonds of \nlove and trust are created as children sense the valu e parents give to their problems and to them as \nindividuals.    This paradigm is powerful in business as well.  One department store chain that operates from this \nparadigm has created a great loyalty among its custom ers.  Any time a customer comes into the store \nwith a problem, not matter how small, the clerks i mmediately see it as an opportunity to build the",

So I worked for a number of months in a compromise \nmode to avoid what might turn out to be an ugly  confrontation.  All the while, bad feelings were \ndeveloping inside both of us.    After reading that it is more noble to give yo urself completely to one individual than to labor \ndiligently for the salvation of the masses, I was d eeply affected by the idea of rebuilding that \nrelationship.    I had to steel myself for what lay ahead, because I knew it would be hard to really get the issues out \nand to achieve a deep, common understanding and commitment.  I remember actually shaking in \nanticipation of the visit.  He seemed like such a h ard man, so set in his own ways and so right in his \nown eyes; yet I needed his strengths and abilities.  I was afraid a confrontation might jeopardize the \nrelationship and result in my losing those strengths.    I went through a mental dress rehearsal of the an ticipated visit, and I finally became settled within \nmyself around the principles rather than  the practices of what I was going to do and say.  At last I felt \npeace of mind and the courag e to have the communication. \n   When we met together, to my total surprise, I di scovered that this man had been going through the \nvery same process and had been longing for such  a conversation.  He was anything but hard and \ndefensive.    Nevertheless, our administrative styles were co nsiderably different, and th e entire organization was \nresponding to these differences.  We both acknowle dged the problems that our disunity had created.  \nOver several visits, we were able to confront the deeper  issues, to get them all out on the table, and to \nresolve them, one by one, with a spirit of high mu tual respect.  We were able to develop a powerful \ncomplementary team and a deep personal affection which added tremendously to our ability to work \neffectively together.    Creating the unity necessary to run an effectiv e business or a family or a marriage requires great \npersonal strength and courage.  No amount of tec hnical administrative skill in laboring for the masses \ncan make up for lack of nobility of personal characte r in developing relationships.  It is at a very \n",

After reading that it is more noble to give yo urself completely to one individual than to labor \ndiligently for the salvation of the masses, I was d eeply affected by the idea of rebuilding that \nrelationship.

I was afraid a confrontation might jeopardize the \nrelationship and result in my losing those strengths.

No amount of tec hnical administrative skill in laboring for the masses \ncan make up for lack of nobility of personal characte r in developing relationships.  It is at a very \nessential, one-on-one level, that we liv e the primary laws of love and life. \n P Problems are PC Opportunities     This experience also taught me another powerful  paradigm of interdependence.  It deals with the \nway in which we see problems.  I had lived for months  t r y i n g  t o  a v o i d  t h e  p r o b l e m ,  s e e i n g  i t  a s  a  \nsource of irritation, a stumbling block, and wishing it  would somehow go away.

I suggest that in an interdependent situation,  every P problem is a PC o pportunity -- a chance to \nbuild the Emotional Bank Accounts that sign ificantly affect interdependent production. \n   When parents see their children's problems as op portunities to build the relationship instead of as \nnegative, burdensome irritations, it totally changes the nature of  parent-child interaction.  Parents \nbecome more willing, even excited, about deeply understanding and helping their children.  When a \nchild comes to them with a problem, instead of  thinking, \"Oh, no! Not another problem!\" their \nparadigm is, \"Here is a great opportunity for me to  really help my child and to invest in our \nrelationship.\"  Many interactions change from tran sactional to transformation al, and strong bonds of \nlove and trust are created as children sense the valu e parents give to their problems and to them as \nindividuals.    This paradigm is powerful in business as well.  One department store chain that operates from this \nparadigm has created a great loyalty among its custom ers.  Any time a customer comes into the store \nwith a problem, not matter how small, the clerks i mmediately see it as an opportunity to build the",

    "text": " suggest that in an interdependent situation,  every P problem is a PC o pportunity -- a chance to \nbuild the Emotional Bank Accounts that sign ificantly affect interdependent production. \n   When parents see their children's problems as op portunities to build the relationship instead of as \nnegative, burdensome irritations, it totally changes the nature of  parent-child interaction.  Parents \nbecome more willing, even excited, about deeply understanding and helping their children.  When a \nchild comes to them with a problem, instead of  thinking, \"Oh, no! Not another problem!\" their \nparadigm is, \"Here is a great opportunity for me to  really help my child and to invest in our \nrelationship.\"  Many interactions change from tran sactional to transformation al, and strong bonds of \nlove and trust are created as children sense the valu e parents give to their problems and to them as \nindividuals.    This paradigm is powerful in business as well.  One department store chain that operates from this \nparadigm has created a great loyalty among its custom ers.  Any time a customer comes into the store \nwith a problem, not matter how small, the clerks i mmediately see it as an opportunity",
