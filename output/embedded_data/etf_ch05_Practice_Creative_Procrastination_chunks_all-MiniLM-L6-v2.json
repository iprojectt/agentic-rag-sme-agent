Single out the relatively few small jobs\nthat absolutely must be done immediately in the morning. Then go directly\nto the big tasks and pursue them to completion.”\nBoardroom Reports\nCreative procrastination is one of the most effective of all personal\nperformance techniques. It can change your life.\nThe fact is that you can't do everything that you have to do. You have\nto procrastinate on something! Therefore, procrastinate on small tasks.\nPut off eating smaller or less ugly frogs. Eat the biggest and ugliest\nfrogs before anything else. Do the worst first!\nEveryone procrastinates. The difference between high performers\nand low performers is largely determined by what they choose to\nprocrastinate on.\nSince you must procrastinate anyway, decide today to procrastinate\non low value activities. Decide to procrastinate, outsource, delegate\nand eliminate those activities that don't make much of a\ncontribution to your life in any case. Get rid of the tadpoles and\nfocus on the frogs.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 42Priorities versus Posteriorities\nHere is a key point. To set proper priorities, you must set\nposteriorities as well. A priority  is something that you do more of and\nsooner, while a posteriority is something that you do less of and later,if at all.\nRule: “You can only get your time and your life under control to the\ndegree to which you discontinue lower value activities.”\nOne of the most powerful of all words in time management is the\nword \"No!\" Say it politely and courteously. Say it clearly so that thereare no misunderstandings. Say it regularly, as a normal part of your\ntime management vocabulary.\nSay \"no\" to anything that is not a high value use of your time and\nyour life. Say “no” graciously but firmly to avoid agreeing to\nsomething against your will. Say it early and say it often. Remember\nthat you have no spare time. As we say, \"Your dance card is full.\"\nFor you to do something new, you must complete or stop doing\nsomething old. Getting in requires getting out. Picking up means\nputting down.\nCreative procrastination is the act of thoughtfully and deliberately\ndeciding upon the exact things you are not going to do right now, if\never.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 43Procrastinate on Purpose\nMost people engage in unconscious  procrastination. They\nprocrastinate without thinking about it. As a result, they\nprocrastinate on the big, valuable, important tasks that can havesignificant long-term consequences to their lives and careers.\nYou must avoid this common tendency at all costs.\nYour job is to deliberately procrastinate on those tasks that are of low\nvalue so that you have more time for those tasks that can make a big\ndifference in your life and work.\nContinually review your duties and responsibilities to identify those\ntime consuming tasks and activities that you can abandon with no\nreal loss. This is an ongoing responsibility for you that never ends.\nFor example, a friend of mine, when he was single, was an avid\ngolfer. He liked to golf three and four times a week, three to four\nhours each time.\nOver a period of years, he started a business, got married and had\ntwo children. But he still played golf three to five times a week until\nhe finally realized that his time on the golf course was causing him\nenormous stress at home and at the office. It was only by\nabandoning most of his golf games that he could get his life back\nunder control.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 44Set Posteriorities on Time Consuming Activities\nContinually review your life and work to find those time consuming\ntasks and activities that you can abandon with no real loss. Cut downon television watching and spend the time saved with your family, orreading or exercising, or doing something that enhances the quality\nof your life.\nLook at your work activities and identify the tasks that you could\ndelegate or eliminate to free up more time for the work that really\ncounts. Begin today to practice creative procrastination, to set\nposteriorities wherever and whenever you can. This decision alonecan enable to get your time and your life under control.\nEat That Frog!\n1.   Practice zero-based thinking on every part of your life. Ask\nyourself continually, “If I was not doing this already, knowing what I\nnow know, would I start it up, or get into it again today?” If it is\nsomething you would not start up again today, knowing what you\nnow know, it is a prime candidate for abandonment or creative\nprocrast",

Single out the relatively few small jobs\nthat absolutely must be done immediately in the morning. Then go directly\nto the big tasks and pursue them to completion.”\nBoardroom Reports\nCreative procrastination is one of the most effective of all personal\nperformance techniques. It can change your life.\nThe fact is that you can't do everything that you have to do. You have\nto procrastinate on something! Therefore, procrastinate on small tasks.\nPut off eating smaller or less ugly frogs. Eat the biggest and ugliest\nfrogs before anything else. Do the worst first!\nEveryone procrastinates. The difference between high performers\nand low performers is largely determined by what they choose to\nprocrastinate on.\nSince you must procrastinate anyway, decide today to procrastinate\non low value activities. Decide to procrastinate, outsource, delegate\nand eliminate those activities that don't make much of a\ncontribution to your life in any case.

Say it clearly so that thereare no misunderstandings. Say it regularly, as a normal part of your\ntime management vocabulary.\nSay \"no\" to anything that is not a high value use of your time and\nyour life. Say “no” graciously but firmly to avoid agreeing to\nsomething against your will. Say it early and say it often. Remember\nthat you have no spare time. As we say, \"Your dance card is full.\"\nFor you to do something new, you must complete or stop doing\nsomething old. Getting in requires getting out. Picking up means\nputting down.\nCreative procrastination is the act of thoughtfully and deliberately\ndeciding upon the exact",

Single out the relatively few small jobs\nthat absolutely must be done immediately in the morning. Then go directly\nto the big tasks and pursue them to completion.”\nBoardroom Reports\nCreative procrastination is one of the most effective of all personal\nperformance techniques. It can change your life.\nThe fact is that you can't do everything that you have to do. You have\nto procrastinate on something! Therefore, procrastinate on small tasks.\nPut off eating smaller or less ugly frogs. Eat the biggest and ugliest\nfrogs before anything else. Do the worst first!\nEveryone procrastinates. The difference between high performers\nand low performers is largely determined by what they choose to\nprocrastinate on.\nSince you must procrastinate anyway, decide today to procrastinate\non low value activities. Decide to procrastinate, outsource, delegate\nand eliminate those activities that don't make much of a\ncontribution to your life in any case. Get rid of the tadpoles and\nfocus on the frogs.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE ",

Get rid of the tadpoles and\nfocus on the frogs.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 42Priorities versus Posteriorities\nHere is a key point. To set proper priorities, you must set\nposteriorities as well. A priority  is something that you do more of and\nsooner, while a posteriority is something that you do less of and later,if at all.\nRule: “You can only get your time and your life under control to the\ndegree to which you discontinue lower value activities.”\nOne of the most powerful of all words in time management is the\nword \"No!\" Say it politely and courteously. Say it clearly so that thereare no misunderstandings. Say it regularly, as a normal part of your\ntime management vocabulary.\nSay \"no\" to anything that is not a high value use of your time and\nyour life. Say “no” graciously but firmly to avoid agreeing to\nsomething against your will. Say it early and say it often. Remember\nthat you have no spare time. As we say, \"Your dance card is full",

Picking up means\nputting down.\nCreative procrastination is the act of thoughtfully and deliberately\ndeciding upon the exact things you are not going to do right now, if\never.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 43Procrastinate on Purpose\nMost people engage in unconscious  procrastination. They\nprocrastinate without thinking about it. As a result, they\nprocrastinate on the big, valuable, important tasks that can havesignificant long-term consequences to their lives and careers.\nYou must avoid this common tendency at all costs.\nYour job is to deliberately procrastinate on those tasks that are of low\nvalue so that you have more time for those tasks that can make a big\ndifference in your life and work.\nContinually review your duties and responsibilities to identify those\ntime consuming tasks and activities that you can abandon with no\nreal loss. This is an ongoing responsibility for you that never ends.\nFor example, a friend of mine, when he was single, was an avid\ngolfer. He liked to golf three and four times a week, three to four\nhours each time.\nOver a period of years, he started a business, got married and had\ntwo children. But he still played golf three to five times a week until\nhe finally realized that his time on the golf course was causing him\nenormous stress at home and at the office. It was only by\nabandoning most of his golf games that he could get his life back\nunder control.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 44Set Posteriorities on Time Consuming Activities\nContinually review your life and work to find those time consuming\ntasks and activities that you can abandon with no real loss. Cut downon television watching and spend the time saved with your family, orreading or exercising, or doing something that enhances the quality\nof your life.\nLook at your work activities and identify the tasks that you could\ndelegate or eliminate to free up more time for the work that really\ncounts. Begin today to practice creative procrastination, to set\nposteriorities wherever and whenever you can. This decision alonecan enable to get your time and your life under control.\nEat That Frog!\n1.   Practice zero-based thinking on every part of your life. Ask\nyourself continually, “If I was not doing this already, knowing what",

Picking up means\nputting down.\nCreative procrastination is the act of thoughtfully and deliberately\ndeciding upon the exact things you are not going to do right now, if\never.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 43Procrastinate on Purpose\nMost people engage in unconscious  procrastination. They\nprocrastinate without thinking about it. As a result, they\nprocrastinate on the big, valuable, important tasks that can havesignificant long-term consequences to their lives and careers.\nYou must avoid this common tendency at all costs.\nYour job is to deliberately procrastinate on those tasks that are of low\nvalue so that you have more time for those tasks that can make a big\ndifference in your life and work.\nContinually review your duties and responsibilities to identify those\ntime consuming tasks and activities that you can abandon with no\nreal loss. This is an ongoing responsibility for you that never ends.\nFor example, a friend of mine, when he was single, was an avid\ngolfer. He liked to golf three and four times a week, three to four\nhours each time.\n",

He liked to golf three and four times a week, three to four\nhours each time.\nOver a period of years, he started a business, got married and had\ntwo children. But he still played golf three to five times a week until\nhe finally realized that his time on the golf course was causing him\nenormous stress at home and at the office. It was only by\nabandoning most of his golf games that he could get his life back\nunder control.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 44Set Posteriorities on Time Consuming Activities\nContinually review your life and work to find those time consuming\ntasks and activities that you can abandon with no real loss. Cut downon television watching and spend the time saved with your family, orreading or exercising, or doing something that enhances the quality\nof your life.\nLook at your work activities and identify the tasks that you could\ndelegate or eliminate to free up more time for the work that really\ncounts. Begin today to practice creative procrastination, to set\nposteriorities wherever and whenever you can.",
