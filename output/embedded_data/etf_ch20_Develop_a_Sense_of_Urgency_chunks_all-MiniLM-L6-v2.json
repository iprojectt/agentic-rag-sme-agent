They then launch quickly and strongly toward their goals\nand objectives. They work steadily, smoothly and continuously. As a\nresult, they seem to power through enormous amounts of work in thesame amount of time that the average person spends socializing,\nwasting time and working on low value activities.\nWorking in the “Zone”\nWhen you work on your most important tasks at a high and\ncontinuous level of activity, you can actually enter into an amazing\nmental state called \"flow.\" Almost everyone has experienced this at\nsome time. Really successful people are those who get themselves\ninto this state far more often than the average.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 113In the state of \"flow,\" which is the highest human state of\nperformance and productivity, something almost miraculous\nhappens to your mind and emotions.\nYou feel elated and clear. Everything you do seems effortless and\naccurate. You feel happy and energized. You experience a\ntremendous sense of calm and increased personal effectiveness.\nIn the state of \"flow,\" identified and talked about over the centuries,\nyou actually function on a higher plane of clarity, creativity and\ncompetence. You are more sensitive and aware. Your insight and\nintuition functions with incredible precision. You see theinterconnectedness of people and circumstances around you. You\noften come up with brilliant ideas and insights that enable you to\nmove ahead even more rapidly.\nTrigger Yourself into High Performance\nOne of the ways you can trigger this state of flow is by developing a\n\"sense of urgency.” This is an inner drive and desire to get on with\nthe job quickly and get it done fast. This inner drive is an impatience\nthat motivates you to get going and to keep going. A sense of\nurgency feels very much like racing against yourself.\nWith this ingrained sense of urgency, you develop a \"bias for action.\"\nYou take action rather than talking continually about what you are\ngoing to do. You focus on specific steps you can take immediately.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 114You concentrate on the things you can do right now to get the results\nyou want and achieve the goals you desire.\nFast tempo seems to go hand in hand with all great success.\nDeveloping this tempo requires that you start moving and keepmoving at a steady rate. The faster you move, the more impelled youfeel to do even more, even faster. You enter “the zone.”\nBuild Up a Sense of Momentum\nWhen you regularly take continuous action toward your most\nimportant goals, you activate the \"Momentum Principle” of success.\nThis principle says that although it may take tremendous amounts ofenergy to overcome inertia and get started initially, it then takes far\nless energy to keep going.\nThe good news is that the faster you move, the more energy you have.\nThe faster  you move, the more you get done and the more effective\nyou feel. The faster you move, the more experience you get and the\nmore you learn. The faster you move, the more competent and\ncapable you become at your work.\nA sense of urgency shifts you automatically onto the fast track in\nyour career. The faster you work and the more you get done, the\nhigher will be your levels of self-esteem, self-respect and personal\npride. You feel in complete control of your life and your work.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 115Do It Now!\nOne of the simplest and yet most powerful ways to get yourself\nstarted is to repeat the words, \"Do it now! Do it now! Do it now!\"over and over to yourself.\nIf you feel yourself slowing down or becoming distracted by\nconversations or low value activities, repeat to yourself the words,\"Back to work! Back to work! Back to work!\" over and over.\nIn the final analysis, nothing will help you more in your career than\nfor you to get the reputation for being the kind of person who getsimportant work done quickly and well. This reputation will make\nyou one of the most valuable and respected people in your field.\nEat That Frog!\n1.  Resolve today to develop a sense of urgency in everything you do.\nSelect one area where you have a tendency to procrastinate and make\na decision to develop the habit of fast action in that area.\n2.  When you see an opportunity or a problem, take action on it",

They then launch quickly and strongly toward their goals\nand objectives. They work steadily, smoothly and continuously. As a\nresult, they seem to power through enormous amounts of work in thesame amount of time that the average person spends socializing,\nwasting time and working on low value activities.\nWorking in the “Zone”\nWhen you work on your most important tasks at a high and\ncontinuous level of activity, you can actually enter into an amazing\nmental state called \"flow.\" Almost everyone has experienced this at\nsome time. Really successful people are those who get themselves\ninto this state far more often than the average.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 113In the state of \"flow,\" which is the highest human state of\nperformance and productivity, something almost miraculous\nhappens to your mind and emotions.\nYou feel elated and clear. Everything you do seems effortless and\naccurate. You feel happy and energized. You experience a\ntremendous sense of calm and increased personal effectiveness.\nIn the state of \"flow,\" identified and talked about over the centuries,\nyou actually function on a higher plane of clarity, creativity and\ncompetence. You are more sensitive and aware. Your insight and\nintuition functions with incredible precision. You see theinterconnectedness of people and circumstances around you. You\noften come up with brilliant ideas and insights that enable you to\nmove ahead even more rapidly.\nTrigger Yourself into High Performance\nOne of the ways you can trigger this state of flow is by developing a\n\"sense of urgency.” This is an inner drive and desire to get on with\nthe job quickly and get it done fast. This inner drive is an impatience\nthat motivates you to get going and to keep going. A sense of\nurgency feels very much like racing against yourself.\nWith this ingrained sense of urgency, you develop a \"bias for action.\"\nYou take action rather",

Really successful people are those who get themselves\ninto this state far more often than the average.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 113In the",

A sense of\nurgency feels very much like racing against yourself.\nWith this ingrained sense of urgency, you develop a \"bias for action.\"\nYou take action rather than talking continually about what you are\ngoing to do. You focus on specific steps you can take immediately.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 114You concentrate on the things you can do right now to get the results\nyou want and achieve the goals you desire.\nFast tempo seems to go hand in hand with all great success.\nDeveloping this tempo requires that you start moving and keepmoving at a steady rate. The faster you move, the more impelled youfeel to do even more, even faster. You enter “the zone.”\nBuild Up a Sense of Momentum\nWhen you regularly take continuous action toward your most\nimportant goals, you activate the \"Momentum Principle” of success.\nThis principle says that although it may take tremendous amounts ofenergy to overcome inertia and get started initially, it then takes far\nless energy to keep going.\nThe good news is that the faster you move, the more energy you have.\nThe faster  you move, the more you get done and the more effective\nyou feel. The faster you move, the more experience you get and the\nmore you learn. The faster you move, the more competent and\ncapable you become at your work.\nA sense of urgency shifts you automatically onto the fast track in\nyour career. The faster you work and the more you get done, the\nhigher will be your levels of self-esteem, self-respect and personal\npride. You feel in complete control of your life and your work.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 115Do It Now!\nOne of the simplest and yet most powerful ways to get yourself\nstarted is to repeat the words, \"Do it now! Do it now! Do it now!\"over and over to yourself.\nIf you feel yourself slowing down or becoming distracted by\nconversations or low value activities, repeat to yourself the words,\"Back to work! Back to work! Back to work!\" over and over.\nIn the final analysis, nothing will help you more in your career than\nfor you to get the reputation for being the kind of person who getsimportant work done quickly and well. This reputation will make\nyou one of the most valuable and respected people in your field.\nEat That Frog!\n1.  Resolve today to develop a sense",
