It just means ident ifying each item \nand deciding what it is, what it means, and what yo u're going to \ndo with it. \nWhen you've finished processing \"in,\" you will have\n1 | trashed what you don't need; \n2 | completed any less-than-two-minute actions; \n3 | handed off to others anything that can be delegate d; \n4 | sorted into your own organizing system reminders o f \nactions that require more than two minutes; and \n5 |   identified any larger commitments (projects) y ou now have, \nbased on the input. \nTo get an overview of this process, you may find it  useful \nhere to refer to the Workflow Diagram on page 120. The center \ncolumn illustrates all the steps involved in proces sing and decid- \ning your next actions. \nThis chapter focuses on the components in the diagr am's \ncenter column, the steps from \"in\" to next action. You'll immedi- \nately see the natural organization that results fro m following this \nprocess for each of your open loops. For instance, if you pick up \nsomething from \"in\" and realize, \"I've got to call Andrea about \n119 \n120 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY I  PART TWO \nWORKFLOW DIAGRAM—PROCESSING \n\nCHAPTER 6  I  PROCESSING: GETTING \"IN\" TO EMPTY \nthat, but I've got to do it on Monday, when she's i n her office,\" \nthen you'll defer that action immediately and enter  it into your \ncalendar for Monday. \nI recommend that you read through this chapter and the \nnext one, on organizing your actions, before you ac tually start \nprocessing what you've collected in \"in.\" It may sa ve you some \nsteps. When I coach clients through this process, i t invariably \nbecomes a dance back and forth between the simple d ecision- \nmaking stage of processing the open loops and the trickier task of \nfiguring out the best way to enter these decisions in a client's par- \nticular organization system. \nMany of my coaching clients, for example, are eager  to \nget set up personally on a PDA organizer that will synchro- \nnize with Microsoft Outlook, which their company is  using for \ne-mail and scheduling. The first thing we have to d o (after \nwe've collected the in-basket) is make sure all the ir hardware \nand software are working. Then we clean up (print o ut and \nerase, usually) everything they have previously tri ed to organize \nin their Outlook task lists and put it all into \"in .\" Then we estab- \nlish some working categories such as \"Calls,\" \"Erra nds,\" \"Agen- \ndas,\" \"At Computer,\" and so on. As we begin to proc ess the \nin-basket, the client can go immediately to his com puter and \ntype his action steps directly into the system he w ill ultimately \ndepend on. \nIf you're not sure yet what you're going to be usin g as a per- \nsonal reminder system, don't worry. You can begin v ery appropri- \nately with the low-tech initial process of notes on  pieces of paper. \nYou can always upgrade your tools later, once you h ave your sys- \ntem in place. \nProcessing Guidelines \nThe best way to learn this model is by doing. But t here are a few \nbasic rules to follow: \n121 \nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY I  PART TWO \n• Process the top item first. \n• Process one item at a time. \n• Never put anything back into \"in.\" \nTop Item First \nEven if the second item down is a personal note to you from the \npresident of your country, and the top item is a pi ece of junk mail, \nyou've got to process the junk mail first! That's a n \nexaggeration to make a point, but the principle is an \nimportant one: everything gets processed equally. \nThe verb \"process\" does not mean \"spend time on.\" I t \njust means \"decide what the thing is and what actio n \nis required, and then dispatch it accordingly.\" You 're going to get \nto the bottom of the basket as soon as you can anyw ay, and you \ndon't want to avoid dealing with anything in there. \nEmergency Scanning Is Not Processing \nMost people get to their in-basket or their e-mail and look for the \nmost urgent, most fun",

It just means ident ifying each item \nand deciding what it is, what it means, and what yo u're going to \ndo with it. \nWhen you've finished processing \"in,\" you will have\n1 | trashed what you don't need; \n2 | completed any less-than-two-minute actions; \n3 | handed off to others anything that can be delegate d; \n4 | sorted into your own organizing system reminders o f \nactions that require more than two minutes; and \n5 |   identified any larger commitments (projects) y ou now have, \nbased on the input. \nTo get an overview of this process, you may find it  useful \nhere to refer to the Workflow Diagram on page 120. The center \ncolumn illustrates all the steps involved in proces sing and decid- \ning your next actions. \nThis chapter focuses on the components in the diagr am's \ncenter column, the steps from \"in\" to next action. You'll immedi- \nately see the natural organization that results fro m following this \nprocess for each of your open loops. For instance, if you pick up \nsomething from \"in\" and realize, \"I've got to call Andrea about \n119 \n120 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY I  PART TWO \nWORKFLOW DIAGRAM—PROCESSING \n\nCHAPTER 6  I  PROCESSING: GETTING \"IN\" TO EMPTY \nthat, but I've got to do it on Monday, when she's i n her office,\" \nthen you'll defer that action immediately and enter  it into your \ncalendar for Monday. \nI recommend that you read through this chapter and the \nnext one, on organizing your actions, before you ac tually start \nprocessing what you've collected in \"in.\" It may sa ve you some \nsteps. When I coach clients through this process, i t invariably \nbecomes a dance back and forth between the simple d ecision- \nmaking stage of processing the open loops and the trickier task of \nfiguring out the best way to enter these decisions in a client's par- \nticular organization system. \nMany of my coaching clients, for example",

    "text": " d ecision- \nmaking stage of processing the open loops and the trickier task of \nfiguring out the best way to enter these decisions in a client's par- \nticular organization system. \nMany of my coaching clients, for example, are eager  to \nget set up personally on a PDA organizer that will synchro- \nnize with Microsoft Outlook, which their company is  using for \ne-mail and scheduling. The first thing we have to d o (after \nwe've collected the in-basket) is make sure all the ir hardware \nand software are working. Then we clean up (print o ut and \nerase, usually) everything they have previously tri ed to organize \nin their Outlook task lists and put it all into \"in .\" Then we estab- \nlish some working categories such as \"Calls,\" \"Erra nds,\" \"Agen- \ndas,\" \"At Computer,\" and so on. As we begin to proc ess the \nin-basket, the client can go immediately to his com puter and \ntype his action steps directly into the system he w ill ultimately \ndepend on. \nIf you're not sure yet what you're going to be usin g as a per- \nsonal reminder system, don't worry. You can begin v ery appropri- \nately with the low-tech initial process of notes on  pieces of paper. \nYou can always upgrade your tools later, once you h ave your sys- \ntem in place. \nProcessing Guidelines \nThe best way to learn this model is by doing. But t here are a few \nbasic rules to follow: \n121 \nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY I  PART TWO \n• Process the top item first. \n• Process one item at a time. \n• Never put anything back into \"in.\" \nTop Item First \nEven if the second item down is a personal note to you from the \npresident of your country, and the top item is a pi ece of junk mail, \nyou've got to process the junk mail first! That's a n \nexaggeration to make a point, but the principle is an \nimportant one: everything gets processed equally. \nThe verb \"process\" does not mean \"spend time on.\" I t \njust means \"decide what the thing is and what actio n \nis required, and then dispatch it accordingly.\" You 're going to get \nto the bottom of the basket as soon",

    "text": " as you can anyw ay, and you \ndon't want to avoid dealing with anything in there. \nEmergency Scanning Is Not Processing \nMost people get to their in-basket or their e-mail and look for the \nmost urgent, most fun, or most interesting stuff to  deal with first. \n\"Emergency scanning\" is fine and necessary sometime s (I do \nit, too). Maybe you've just come back from an off-s ite meeting \nand have to be on a long conference call in fifteen  minutes. So \nyou check to make sure there are no land mines abou t to explode \nand to see if your client has e-mailed you back OK' ing the big \nproposal. \nBut that's not processing your in-basket; it's emer gency \nscanning. When you're in processing mode, you must get into the \nhabit of starting at one end and just cranking thro ugh items one \nat a time, in order. As soon as you break that rule , and process only \nwhat you feel like processing, and in whatever order, you'll inva ri- \nably begin to leave things unprocessed. Then you wi ll no longer \nhave a functioning funnel, and it will back up all over your desk \nand office. \n122 Process does \nnot mean \"spend \ntime on.\" \nCHAPTER 6  |  PROCESSING: GETTING \"IN\" TO EMPTY \nLIFOorFIFO? \nTheoretically, you should flip your in-basket upsid e down and \nprocess first the first thing that came in. As long  as you go from \none end clear through to the other within a reasona ble period of \ntime, though, it won't make much difference. You're\ngoing to see it all in short order anyway. And if y ou're \ngoing to attempt to clear up a big backlog of e-mai ls \nstaged in \"in,\" you'll actually discover it's more effi- \ncient to process the last-in first because of all t he dis- \ncussion  threads  that  accumulate  on  top  of one\nanother. \nOne Item at a Time \nYou may find you have a tendency, while processing your in- \nbasket, to pick something up, not know exactly what  you want to \ndo about it, and then let your eyes wander onto ano ther item far- \nther down the stack and get engaged with it. That item may be \nmore attractive to your psyche because you know right away what \nto do with it —and you don't feel like thinking about what's in \nyour hand. This is dangerous territory. What's in y our hand is \nlikely to land on a \"hmppphhh\" stack on the side of  your desk \nbecause you become distracted by something easier, more impor- \ntant, or more interesting below it. \nMost people also want to take a whole stack of thin gs out of \nthe in-basket at once, put it right in front of the m, and try to \ncrank through it. Although I empathize with the des ire to \"deal \nwith a big chunk,\" I constantly remind clients to p ut back every- \nthing but the one item on top. The focus on just on e thing forces \nthe requisite attention and decision-making to get through all \nyour stuff. And if you get interrupted (which is li kely), you won't \nhave umpteen parts of \"in\" scattered around outside  the tray and \nout of control again. \n123 The in-basket is a \nprocessing station,\nnot a storage bin.\n124 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  |  PART TWO \nThe Multitasking Exception \nThere's a subtle exception to the one-item-at-a-tim e rule. Some \npersonality types really need to shift their focus away from some- \nthing for at least a minute in order to make a deci sion about it. \nWhen I see this going on with someone, I let him ta ke two or \nsometimes three things out at once as he's processi ng. It's then \neasier and faster for him to make a choice about th e action \nrequired. \nRemember, multitasking is an exception—and it works\nonly \nif you hold to the discipline of working through ev ery item in \nshort order, and never avoid any decision for longer than a minute \nor two. \nNothing Goes Back into \"In\" \nThere's a one-way path out of \"in.\" This is actuall y what was \nmeant by the old admonition to \"handle things once, \" though \nhandling things just once is in fact a bad idea. If  you did that, \nyou'd never have a list, because you would finish e verything as \nsoon as you saw it. You'd also be highly ineffectiv e and inefficient, \nsince most",

Maybe you've just come back from an off-s ite meeting \nand have to be on a long conference call in fifteen  minutes. So \nyou check to make sure there are no land mines abou t to explode \nand to see if your client has e-mailed you back OK' ing the big \nproposal. \nBut that's not processing your in-basket; it's emer gency \nscanning. When you're in processing mode, you must get into the \nhabit of starting at one end and just cranking thro ugh items one \nat a time, in order. As soon as you break that rule , and process only \nwhat you feel like processing, and in whatever order, you'll inva ri- \nably begin to leave things unprocessed. Then you wi ll no longer \nhave a functioning funnel, and it will back up all over your desk \nand office. \n122 Process does \nnot mean \"spend \ntime on.\" \nCHAPTER 6  |  PROCESSING: GETTING \"IN\" TO EMPTY \nLIFOorFIFO? \nTheoretically, you should flip your in-basket upsid e down and \nprocess first the first thing that came in. As long  as you go from \none end clear through to the other within a reasona ble period of \ntime, though, it won't make much difference. You're\ngoing to see it all in short order anyway. And if y ou're \ngoing to attempt to clear up a big backlog of e-mai ls \nstaged in \"in,\" you'll actually discover it's more effi- \ncient to process the last-in first because of all t he dis- \ncussion  threads  that  accumulate  on  top  of one\nanother. \nOne Item at a Time \nYou may find you have a tendency, while processing your in- \nbasket, to pick something up, not know exactly what  you want to \ndo about it, and then let your eyes wander onto ano ther item far- \nther down the stack and get engaged with it.

    "text": " while processing your in- \nbasket, to pick something up, not know exactly what  you want to \ndo about it, and then let your eyes wander onto ano ther item far- \nther down the stack and get engaged with it. That item may be \nmore attractive to your psyche because you know right away what \nto do with it —and you don't feel like thinking about what's in \nyour hand. This is dangerous territory. What's in y our hand is \nlikely to land on a \"hmppphhh\" stack on the side of  your desk \nbecause you become distracted by something easier, more impor- \ntant, or more interesting below it. \nMost people also want to take a whole stack of thin gs out of \nthe in-basket at once, put it right in front of the m, and try to \ncrank through it. Although I empathize with the des ire to \"deal \nwith a big chunk,\" I constantly remind clients to p ut back every- \nthing but the one item on top. The focus on just on e thing forces \nthe requisite attention and decision-making to get through all \nyour stuff. And if you get interrupted (which is li kely), you won't \nhave umpteen parts of \"in\" scattered around outside  the tray and \nout of control again. \n123 The in-basket is a \nprocessing station,\nnot a storage bin.\n124 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  |  PART TWO \nThe Multitasking Exception \nThere's a subtle exception to the one-item-at-a-tim e rule. Some \npersonality types really need to shift their focus away from some- \nthing for at least a minute in order to make a deci sion about it. \nWhen I see this going on with someone, I let him ta ke two or \nsometimes three things out at once as he's processi ng. It's then \neasier and faster for him to make a choice about th e action \nrequired. \nRemember, multitasking is an exception—and it works\nonly \nif you hold to the discipline of working through ev ery item in \nshort order, and never avoid any decision for longer than a minute \nor two. \nNothing Goes Back into \"In\" \nThere's a one-way path out of \"in.\" This is actuall y what was \nmeant by the old admonition to \"handle things once, \" though \nhandling things just once is",

    "text": " in fact a bad idea. If  you did that, \nyou'd never have a list, because you would finish e verything as \nsoon as you saw it. You'd also be highly ineffectiv e and inefficient, \nsince most things you deal with are not to be acted upon the first \ntime you become aware of them. Where the advice doe s hold is in \neliminating the bad habit of continually picking th ings up out of \n\"in,\" not deciding what they mean or what you're go ing to do \nabout them, and then just leaving them there. A bet ter admoni- \ntion would be, \"The first time you pick something u p from your \nin-basket, decide what to do about it and where it goes. Never put \nit back in \"in.\" \nThe Key Processing Question: \n\"What's the Next Action?\" \nYou've got the message. You're going to deal with o ne item at a \ntime. And you're going to make a firm next-action d ecision about \nCHAPTER 6  |  PROCESSING: GETTING \"IN\" TO EMPTY \neach one. This may sound easy—and it is—but \nit \nrequires you to do some fast, hard thinking. Much o f \nthe time the action will not be self-evident; it wi ll \nneed to be determined. \nOn that first item, for example, do you need to \ncall someone? Fill something out? Get information \nfrom the Web? Buy something at the store? Talk to \nyour secretary? E-mail your boss? What? If there's an \naction, its specific nature will determine the next  set \nof options. But what if you say, \"There's really no th- \ning to do with this\"? I am rather like a \nmosquito in a \nnudist camp; I \nknow what I want \nto do, but I don't \nknow where to \nbegin. \n—Stephen Bayne \nWhat If There Is No Action? \nIt's likely that a portion of your in-basket will r equire no action. \nThere will be three types of things in this categor y: \n• Trash \n• Items to incubate \n• Reference material \nTrash \nIf you've been following my suggestions, you'll no doubt already \nhave tossed out a big pile of stuff. It's also like ly that you will have \nput stacks of material into \"in\" that include thing s you don't need \nanymore. So don't be surprised if there's still a l ot more to throw \naway as you process your stuff. \nProcessing all the things in your world will make y ou more \nconscious of what you are going to do and what you should not be \ndoing. One director of a foundation I worked with d iscovered that \nhe had allowed way too many e-mails (thousands!) to  accumulate—\ne-mails that in fact he wasn't ever going to respon d to anyway. He \ntold me that using my method forced him to \"go on a  healthy \ndiet\" about what he would allow to hang around his world as an \nincompletion. \nIt's likely that at some point you'll come up again st the question \n125 \n126 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY I  PART TWO \nof whether or not to keep something for future refe rence. I have \ntwo ways of dealing with that: \n• When in doubt, throw it out. \n• When in doubt, keep it. \nTake your pick. I think either approach is fine. Yo u just need to \ntrust your intuition and be realistic about your sp ace. Most people \nhave some angst about all of this because their sys tems have never \nreally been totally functional and clear-edged befo re. If you make \na clean distinction between what's reference and su pplies and \nwhat requires action, and if your reference system is simple and \nworkable, you can easily keep as much material as y ou can accom- \nmodate. Since no action is required on it, it's jus t a matter of \nphysical space and logistics. \nFiling experts can offer you more detailed guidelin es about \nall this, and your CPA can provide record-retention  timetables \nthat will tell you how long you should keep what ki nds of docu- \nmentation. My suggestion is that you make the disti nction about \nwhether something is actionable or not. Once it's c lear that no \naction is needed, there's room for lots of options.\nIncubate \nThere will probably be things in your in-basket abo ut which you \nwill say to yourself, \"There's nothing to do on thi s now, but there \nmight be later.\" Examples of this would be: \n• A flier announcing a chamber of commerce breakfast with a \nguest speaker you might want to hear",

Much o f \nthe time the action will not be self-evident; it wi ll \nneed to be determined. \nOn that first item, for example, do you need to \ncall someone? Fill something out? Get information \nfrom the Web? Buy something at the store? Talk to \nyour secretary? E-mail your boss? What? If there's an \naction, its specific nature will determine the next  set \nof options. But what if you say, \"There's really no th- \ning to do with this\"? I am rather like a \nmosquito in a \nnudist camp; I \nknow what I want \nto do, but I don't \nknow where to \nbegin. \n—Stephen Bayne \nWhat If There Is No Action? \nIt's likely that a portion of your in-basket will r equire no action. \nThere will be three types of things in this categor y: \n• Trash \n• Items to incubate \n• Reference material",

So don't be surprised if there's still a l ot more to throw \naway as you process your stuff. \nProcessing all the things in your world will make y ou more \nconscious of what you are going to do and what you should not be \ndoing. One director of a foundation I worked with d iscovered that \nhe had allowed way too many e-mails (thousands!) to  accumulate—\ne-mails that in fact he wasn't ever going to respon d to anyway.

I have \ntwo ways of dealing with that: \n• When in doubt, throw it out. \n• When in doubt, keep it. \nTake your pick. I think either approach is fine. Yo u just need to \ntrust your intuition and be realistic about your sp ace. Most people \nhave some angst about all of this because their sys tems have never \nreally been totally functional and clear-edged befo re. If you make \na clean distinction between what's reference and su pplies and \nwhat requires action, and if your reference system is simple and \nworkable, you can easily keep as much material as y ou can accom- \nmodate. Since no action is required on it, it's jus t a matter of \nphysical space and logistics. \nFiling experts can offer you more detailed guidelin es about \nall this, and your CPA can provide record-retention  timetables \nthat will tell you how long you should keep what ki nds of docu- \nmentation.

No action is required on it, other tha n your briefing \nyourself a day ahead of the meeting by reading the agenda. \nCHAPTER 6  |  PROCESSING: GETTING \"IN\" TO EMPTY \n• An advertisement for the next Quicken software upgr ade for \nyour personal finances. Do you really need this nex t version? \nYou don't know .. . you'd rather sleep on it for an other week. \n• An idea you had about something you might want to d o for \nnext year's annual sales meeting. There's nothing t o do on this \nnow, but you'd like to be reminded when the time co mes to \nstart planning for it. \n•A note to yourself about taking a watercolor class , which you \nhave zero time for right now. \nWhat do you do with these kinds of things? There ar e two \noptions that could work: \n• Write them on a \"Someday/Maybe\" list. \n• Put them on your calendar or in a \"tickler\" file. \nThe point of all of these incubation procedures is that they \ngive you a way to get the items off your mind right now and let \nyou feel confident that some reminder of the possib le action will \nresurface at an appropriate time. I'll elaborate on  these in more \ndetail in the next chapter, on organizing. For now, just put a Post- \nit on such items, and label them \"maybe\" or \"remind  on Octo- \nber 17,\" and set them aside in a \"pending\" category  you will be \naccumulating for later sorting.* \nReference \nMany of the things you will uncover in \"in\" will ne ed no action but \nmay have value as potentially useful information ab out projects \n*One of your extra stack baskets is ideal for this purpose. Use it temporarily \nduring this initial processing to gather things to organize later. Afterward you \ncan use it to hold pending work-in-progress papers and physical reminders of \nnext actions. \n127 \n128 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  |  PART TWO \n4ft \nand topics. Ideally, you have already set up a work able filing system \n(as described in chapter 4) for your reference and support infor- \nmation. As you come across material in your in-bask et and e-mail \nthat you'd like to keep for archival or support pur poses, file it. \nYou'll probably discover that there are lots of mis cellaneous \nkinds of things that you want to keep but have pile d up in stacks \nor stuffed into drawers because your reference syst em was too for- \nmal or just plain nonexistent. Let me remind you he re that a less- \nthan-sixty-second, fun-to-use general-reference fil ing system \nwithin arm's reach of where you sit is a mission-cr itical compo- \nnent of full implementation of this methodology. In  the \"battle \nzone\" of real life, if it's not easy, fast, and fun  to file, you'll stack \ninstead of organizing. And then it will become much  more diffi- \ncult to keep things processed. \nWhenever you come across something you want to keep , \nmake a label for it, put it in a file folder, and t uck that into your fil- \ning drawer. Or put a Post-it on it instructing your  secretary or \nassistant to do the same. In my early days of coach ing I used to \ngive my clients permission to keep a \"To File\" pile . No longer. I \ndiscovered that if you can't get it into your syste m immediately, \nyou're probably not ever going to. If you won't do it now, you \nlikely won't do it later, either. \nAnd If There Is an Action . . . What Is It? \nThis is the biggie. If there's something that needs  to be done \nabout the item in \"in,\" then you need to decide wha t exactly \nthat next action is. \"Next Actions\" again, means th e next physical, \nvisible activity that would be required to move the  situation toward \nclosure. \nThis is both easier and more difficult than it soun ds. \nThe next action should be easy to figure out, but there are \noften some quick analyses and several planning step s that haven't",

Use it temporarily \nduring this initial processing to gather things to organize later. Afterward you \ncan use it to hold pending work-in-progress papers and physical reminders of \nnext actions. \n127 \n128 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  |  PART TWO \n4ft \nand topics. Ideally, you have already set up a work able filing system \n(as described in chapter 4) for your reference and support infor- \nmation. As you come across material in your in-bask et and e-mail \nthat you'd like to keep for archival or support pur poses, file it. \nYou'll probably discover that there are lots of mis cellaneous \nkinds of things that you want to keep but have pile d up in stacks \nor stuffed into drawers because your reference syst em was too for- \nmal or just plain nonexistent. Let me remind you he re that a less- \nthan-sixty-second, fun-to-use general-reference fil ing system \nwithin arm's reach of where you sit is a mission-cr itical compo- \nnent of full implementation of this methodology. In  the \"battle \nzone\" of real life, if it's not easy, fast, and fun  to file, you'll stack \ninstead of organizing. And then it will become much  more diffi- \ncult to keep things processed. \nWhenever you come across something you want to keep , \nmake a label for it, put it in a file folder, and t uck that into your fil- \ning drawer. Or put a Post-it on it instructing your  secretary or \nassistant to do the same. In my early days of coach ing I used to \ngive my clients permission to keep a \"To File\" pile . No longer. I \ndiscovered that if you can't get it into your syste m immediately, \nyou're probably not ever going to. If you won't do it now, you \nlikely won't do it later, either. \nAnd If There Is an Action . . . What Is It? \nThis is the biggie. If there's something that needs  to be done \nabout the item in \"in,\" then you need to decide wha t exactly \nthat next action is. \"Next Actions\" again, means th e next physical, \nvisible activity that would be required",

In  the \"battle \nzone\" of real life, if it's not easy, fast, and fun  to file, you'll stack \ninstead of organizing. And then it will become much  more diffi- \ncult to keep things processed. \nWhenever you come across something you want to keep , \nmake a label for it, put it in a file folder, and t uck that into your fil- \ning drawer.

    "text": " to move the  situation toward \nclosure. \nThis is both easier and more difficult than it soun ds. \nThe next action should be easy to figure out, but there are \noften some quick analyses and several planning step s that haven't \noccurred yet in your mind, and these have to happen  before you \ncan determine precisely what has to happen to compl ete the item, \neven if it's a fairly simple one. \nCHAPTER 6 |  PROCESSING: GETTING \"IN\" TO EMPTY \nLet's look at a sample list of the things that a pe rson might \ntypically have his attention on. \n• Clean the garage \n• Do my taxes \n•- Conference I'm going to \n• Bobby's birthday \n• Press release \n• Performance reviews \n• Management changes \nAlthough each of these items may seem relatively cl ear as a \ntask or project, determining the next action on eac h one will take \nsome thought. \n•Clean the garage \n. . . Well, I just have to get in there and start. No, wa it a minute, \nthere's a big refrigerator in there that I need to get rid of first. I should \nfind out if John Patrick wants it for his camp. I sh ould ... \n•Call John re refrigerator in garage \nWhat about. . . \n•Do my taxes \n. . . but I actually cant start on them until I have my l ast K-l \nback. Can't do any thing until then. So I'm.. . \n•Waiting for K-l from Acme Trust \nAnd for the. . . \n•Conference I'm going to \n129 \nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  |  PART TWO \n. . . I need to find out whether Sandra is going to prepa re a press \nkit for us. I guess I need to. . . \n• E-mail Sandra re press kits for the conference \n. . . and so forth. The action steps—\"Call John,\" \n\"Waiting \nfor K-l,\" \"E-mail Sandra\"—are what need to be decid ed about \neverything that is actionable in your in-basket. \nThe Action Step Needs to Be the Absolute Next Physi cal Thing to Do \nRemember that these are physical, visible activitie s. Many people \nthink they've determined the \"next action\" when the y get it down \nto \"set meeting.\" But that's not the next action, \nbecause it's not descriptive of physical behavior. How \ndo you set a meeting? Well, it could be with a phon e \ncall or an e-mail, but to whom? Decide. If you don' t \ndecide now, you'll still have to decide at some oth er \npoint, and what this process is designed to do is a ctu- \nally get you to finish the thinking exercise about this \nitem. If you haven't identified the next physical \naction required to kick-start it, there will be a p sy- \nchological gap every time you think about it even \nvaguely. You'll tend to resist noticing it. \nWhen you get to a phone or to your computer, you wa nt to \nhave all your thinking completed so you can use the  tools you \nhave and the location you're in to more easily get things done, \nhaving already defined what there is to do. \nWhat if you say to yourself, \"Well, the next thing I need to \ndo is decide what to do about this?\" That's a trick y one. Deciding \nisn't really an action, because actions take time, and deciding \ndoesn't. There's always some physical activity that\ncan be done to facilitate your decision-making. \nNinety-nine percent of the time you just need more \ninformation before you can make a decision. That \nadditional  information   can  come  from  external\n130 Until you know \nwhat the next \nphysical action is, \nthere's still more \nthinking required \nbefore anything can \nhappen. \nDetermine what you \nneed to do in order \nto decide. \nCHAPTER 6  |  PROCESSING: GETTING \"IN\" TO EMPTY \nsources (\"Call Susan to get her input on the propos al\") or from \ninternal thinking (\"Draft ideas about new reorganiz ation\"). \nEither way, there's still a next action to be deter mined in order to \nmove the project forward. \nOnce You Decide What the Action Step is \nYou have three options once you decide what the nex t action \nreally is. \n• Do it (if the action takes less than two minutes). \n• Delegate it (if you're not the most appropriate person to do th e \naction). \n• Defer it into your organization system as an option for work  to \ndo later. \nDo It\nIf the next action can be done in two minutes or le ss, do it",

Many people \nthink they've determined the \"next action\" when the y get it down \nto \"set meeting.\" But that's not the next action, \nbecause it's not descriptive of physical behavior. How \ndo you set a meeting? Well, it could be with a phon e \ncall or an e-mail, but to whom? Decide.

If you haven't identified the next physical \naction required to kick-start it, there will be a p sy- \nchological gap every time you think about it even \nvaguely.

Deciding \nisn't really an action, because actions take time, and deciding \ndoesn't. There's always some physical activity that\ncan be done to facilitate your decision-making. \nNinety-nine percent of the time you just need more \ninformation before you can make a decision.

If the memo requires ju st a thirty- \nsecond reading and then a quick \"yes\"/\"no\"/other re sponse on a \nPost-it back to the sender, do it now. If you can b rowse the catalog \nin just a minute or two to see if there might be an ything of inter- \nest in it, browse away, and then toss it, route it,  or reference it as \nrequired. If the next action on something is to lea ve a quick mes- \nsage on someone's voice-mail, make the call now. \nEven if the item is not a \"high priority\" one, do i t now if \nyou're ever going to do it at all. The rationale fo r the two-minute \nrule is that that's more or less the point where it  starts taking \nlonger to store and track an item than to deal with  it the first time \nit's in your hands-—in other words, it's the effici ency cutoff. If the \nthing's not important enough to be done, throw it away. If it is, \nand if you're going to do it sometime, the efficien cy factor should \ncome into play. \nMany people find that getting into the habit of fol lowing the \ntwo-minute rule creates a dramatic improvement in t heir produc- \ntivity. One vice president of a large software comp any told me \n131 \nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY |  PART TWO \nthat it gave him an additional hour a day of qualit y discretionary \ntime! He was one of those 300-e-mails-a-day high-te ch execu- \ntives, highly focused for most of the workday on \nthree key initiatives. Many of those e-mails were \nfrom people who reported to him—and they needed \nhis eyes on something, his comments and OKs, in \norder to move forward. But because they were not on  a topic in \nhis rifle sights, he would just stage the e-mails i n \"in,\" to get to \n\"later.\" After several thousand of them piled up, h e would have to \ngo in to work and spend whole weekends trying to ca tch up. That \nwould have been OK if he were twenty-six, when ever ything's an \nadrenaline rush anyway, but he was in his thirties and had young \nkids. Working all weekend was no longer acceptable behavior. \nWhen I coached him we went through all 800-plus e-m ails he \ncurrently had in \"in.\" It turned out that a lot cou ld be dumped, \nquite a few needed to be filed as reference, and ma ny others \nrequired less-than-two-minute replies that he whipp ed through. I \nchecked with him a year later, and he was still cur rent! He never \nlet his e-mails mount up beyond a screenful anymore . He said it \nhad changed the nature of his division because of t he dramatic \ndecrease in his own response time. His staff though t he was now \nmade of Teflon! \nThat's a rather dramatic testimonial, but it's an i ndication of \njust how critical some of these simple processing b ehaviors can be, \nespecially as the volume and speed of the input inc rease for you \npersonally. \nTwo minutes is in fact just a guideline. If you hav e a long \nopen window of time in which to process your in-bas ket, you can \nextend the cutoff for each item to five or ten minu tes. If you've got \nto get to the bottom of all your input rapidly, in order to figure out \nhow best to use your afternoon, then you may want t o shorten the \ntime to one minute, or even thirty seconds, so you can get through \neverything a little faster. \nIt's not a bad idea to time yourself for a few of t hese while \nyou're becoming familiar with the process. Most cli ents I work \n132 The two-minute \nrule is magic. \nCHAPTERS  |  PROCESSING: SETTING \"IN\" TO EMPTY \nwith have difficulty estimating how long two min- \nutes actually is, and they greatly underestimate how \nlong certain actions are likely to take. For instan ce, if \nyour action is to leave someone a message, and you \nget the real person instead of his or her voice-mai l, \nthe call will usually take quite a bit longer than two \nminutes. \nThere's nothing you really need to track about \nyour two-minute actions—you just do them.

    "text": " at all. The rationale fo r the two-minute \nrule is that that's more or less the point where it  starts taking \nlonger to store and track an item than to deal with  it the first time \nit's in your hands-—in other words, it's the effici ency cutoff. If the \nthing's not important enough to be done, throw it away. If it is, \nand if you're going to do it sometime, the efficien cy factor should \ncome into play. \nMany people find that getting into the habit of fol lowing the \ntwo-minute rule creates a dramatic improvement in t heir produc- \ntivity. One vice president of a large software comp any told me \n131 \nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY |  PART TWO \nthat it gave him an additional hour a day of qualit y discretionary \ntime! He was one of those 300-e-mails-a-day high-te ch execu- \ntives, highly focused for most of the workday on \nthree key initiatives. Many of those e-mails were \nfrom people who reported to him—and they needed \nhis eyes on something, his comments and OKs, in \norder to move forward.",

    "text": " person instead of his or her voice-mai l, \nthe call will usually take quite a bit longer than two \nminutes. \nThere's nothing you really need to track about \nyour two-minute actions—you just do them. If, howev er, you take \nan action and don't finish the project with that on e action, you'll \nneed to clarify what's next on it, and manage that according to the \nsame criteria. For instance, if you act to replace the cartridge in \nyour favorite pen and discover that you're out of c artridge refills, \nyou'll want to decide on the next action about gett ing them (\"Buy \nrefills at the store\") and do, delegate, or defer it appropriately. \nAdhere to the two-minute rule and see how much you get \ndone in the process of clearing out your \"in\" stack s. Many people \nare amazed by how many two-minute actions are possi ble, often \non some of their most critical current projects. \nLet me make one more observation regarding the two-\nminute rule, this time as it relates to your comfor t with typing \ne-mails. If you're in a large-volume e-mail environ ment, you'll \ngreatly improve your productivity by increasing you r typing speed \nand using the shortcut keyboard commands for your o perating \nsystem and your common e-mail software. Too many so phisti- \ncated professionals are seriously hamstrung because  they still hunt \nand peck and try to use their mouse too much. More work could \nbe dispatched faster by combining the two-minute ru le with \nimproved computer skills. I've found that many exec utives aren't \nresisting technology, they're just resisting their keyboards! \nDelegate It \nIf the next action is going to take longer than two  minutes, ask \nyourself, \"Am I the best person to be doing it?\" If  not, hand it off \nto the appropriate party, in a systematic format. \n133 You'll be surprised \nhow many two- \nminute actions you \ncan perform even \non your most\ncritical projects.\n134 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY |  PART TWO \nDelegation is not always downstream. You may decide , \"This \nhas got to get over to Customer Service,\" or \"My bo ss needs to \nput his eyes on this next,\" or \"I need my partner's  point of view on \nthis.\" \nA \"systematic format\" could be any of the following : \n• Send the appropriate party an e-mail. \n• Write a note or an overnote on paper and route the item \"out\" \nto that person. \n• Leave him or her a voice-mail. \n• Add it as an agenda item on a list for your next re al-time \nconversation with that person. \n• Talk to him or her directly, either face-to-face or  by phone. \nAlthough any of these options can work, I would rec om- \nmend them in the above order, top to bottom. E-mail  is usually \nthe fastest mode into the system; it provides an el ectronic record; \nand the receiver gets to deal with it at his or her  convenience. \nWritten notes are next because they too can get int o the system \nimmediately, and the recipient then has a physical particle to use \nas an organizational reminder. If you're passing on  paper-based \nmaterial as part of the handoff, a written communic ation is obvi- \nously the way to go; as with e-mail, the person you  hand it off to \ncan then deal with it on his or her own schedule. V oice-mail can \nbe efficient, and many professionals live by it; th e downside is that \ntracking becomes an additional requirement for both  you and the \nrecipient, and what you say is not always what gets  heard. Next \nwould be saving the communication on an agenda list  or in a \nfolder for your next regular meeting with the perso n. Sometimes \nthis is necessary because of the sensitive or detai led nature of the \ntopic, but it then must wait to get moving until th at meeting \noccurs. The least preferable option would be to int errupt what \nboth you and the person are doing to talk about the  item. This is \nimmediate, but it hampers workflow for both of you and has the \nsame downside as voice-mail: no written record. \nCHAPTER 6  I  PROCESSING: GETTING \"IN\" TO EMPTY \nTracking the Handoff If you do delegate an action to someone \nelse, and if you care at all whether something happ ens as a result, \nyou'll need to track it. As I will walk you through  in the next \nchapter, about organizing, you'll see that a significant category to \nmanage is \"Waiting For.\" \nAs you develop your own",

If, howev er, you take \nan action and don't finish the project with that on e action, you'll \nneed to clarify what's next on it, and manage that according to the \nsame criteria. For instance, if you act to replace the cartridge in \nyour favorite pen and discover that you're out of c artridge refills, \nyou'll want to decide on the next action about gett ing them (\"Buy \nrefills at the store\") and do, delegate, or defer it appropriately. \nAdhere to the two-minute rule and see how much you get \ndone in the process of clearing out your \"in\" stack s. Many people \nare amazed by how many two-minute actions are possi ble, often \non some of their most critical current projects. \nLet me make one more observation regarding the two-\nminute rule, this time as it relates to your comfor t with typing \ne-mails. If you're in a large-volume e-mail environ ment, you'll \ngreatly improve your productivity by increasing you r typing speed \nand using the shortcut keyboard commands for your o perating \nsystem and your common e-mail software. Too many so phisti- \ncated professionals are seriously hamstrung because  they still hunt \nand peck and try to use their mouse too much. More work could \nbe dispatched faster by combining the two-minute ru le with \nimproved computer skills. I've found that many exec utives aren't \nresisting technology, they're just resisting their keyboards! \nDelegate It \nIf the next action is going to take longer than two  minutes, ask \nyourself, \"Am I the best person to be doing it?\" If  not, hand it off \nto the appropriate party, in a systematic format. \n133 You'll be surprised \nhow many two- \nminute actions you \ncan perform even \non your most\ncritical projects.\n134 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY |  PART TWO \nDelegation is not always downstream. You may decide , \"This \nhas got to get over to Customer Service,\" or \"My bo ss needs to \nput his eyes on this next,\" or \"I need my partner's  point of view on \nthis.\" \nA",

If you're in a large-volume e-mail environ ment, you'll \ngreatly improve your productivity by increasing you r typing speed \nand using the shortcut keyboard commands for your o perating \nsystem and your common e-mail software. Too many so phisti- \ncated professionals are seriously hamstrung because  they still hunt \nand peck and try to use their mouse too much. More work could \nbe dispatched faster by combining the two-minute ru le with \nimproved computer skills. I've found that many exec utives aren't \nresisting technology, they're just resisting their keyboards! \nDelegate It \nIf the next action is going to take longer than two  minutes, ask \nyourself, \"Am I the best person to be doing it?\" If  not, hand it off \nto the appropriate party, in a systematic format. \n133 You'll be surprised \nhow many two- \nminute actions you \ncan perform even \non your most\ncritical projects.\n134 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY |  PART TWO \nDelegation is not always",

You may decide , \"This \nhas got to get over to Customer Service,\" or \"My bo ss needs to \nput his eyes on this next,\" or \"I need my partner's  point of view on \nthis.\" \nA \"systematic format\" could be any of the following : \n• Send the appropriate party an e-mail. \n• Write a note or an overnote on paper and route the item \"out\" \nto that person. \n• Leave him or her a voice-mail. \n• Add it as an agenda item on a list for your next re al-time \nconversation with that person. \n• Talk to him or her directly, either face-to-face or  by phone. \nAlthough any of these options can work, I would rec om- \nmend them in the above order, top to bottom. E-mail  is usually \nthe fastest mode into the system; it provides an el ectronic record; \nand the receiver gets to deal with it at his or her  convenience. \nWritten notes are next because they too can get int o the system \nimmediately, and the recipient then has a physical particle to use \nas an organizational reminder. If you're passing on  paper-based \nmaterial as part of the handoff, a written communic ation is obvi- \nously the way to go; as with e-mail, the person you  hand it off to \ncan then deal with it on his or her own schedule. V oice-mail can \nbe efficient, and many professionals live by it; th e downside is that \ntracking becomes an additional requirement for both  you and the \nrecipient, and what you say is not always what gets  heard. Next \nwould be saving the communication on an agenda list  or in a \nfolder for your next regular meeting with the perso n. Sometimes \nthis is necessary because of the sensitive or detai led nature of the \ntopic, but it then must wait to get moving until th at meeting \noccurs. The least preferable option would be to int errupt what \nboth you and the person are doing to talk about the  item. This is \nimmediate, but it hampers workflow for both of you and has the \nsame downside as voice-mail: no written record. \nCHAPTER 6  I  PROCESSING: GETTING \"IN\" TO EMPTY \nTracking the Handoff If you do delegate an action to someone \nelse, and if you care at all whether something happ",

Sometimes \nthis is necessary because of the sensitive or detai led nature of the \ntopic, but it then must wait to get moving until th at meeting \noccurs.

    "text": " ens as a result, \nyou'll need to track it. As I will walk you through  in the next \nchapter, about organizing, you'll see that a significant category to \nmanage is \"Waiting For.\" \nAs you develop your own customized system, what you\neventually hand off and then track could look like a list in a plan- \nner, a file folder holding separate papers for each  item, and/or a \nlist categorized as \"Waiting For\" in your software.  For now, if you \ndon't have a trusted system set up already, just pu t a note on a \npiece of paper—\"W/F: reply from Bob\"—and put that i nto a \n\"Pending\" stack of notes in a separate pile or tray  that may result \nfrom your processing. \nWhat If the Ball Is Already in Someone Else's Court ? In the exam- \nple cited above about waiting for the last K-l to c ome in so you \ncan do your taxes, the next action is currently on someone else's \nplate. In such situations you will also want to tra ck the action as a \ndelegated item, or as a \"Waiting For.\" On the paper  that says \"Do \nmy taxes,\" write something like \"Waiting for K-l fr om Acme \nTrust\" and put that into your \"Pending\" stack. \nIt's important that you record the date on everythi ng you \nhand off to others. This, of all the categories in your personal sys- \ntem, is the most crucial one to keep tabs on. The f ew times you \nwill actually want to refer to that information (\"B ut I called and \nordered that on March 12\") will make it worth estab lishing this as \na lifelong habit. \nDefer It \nIt's likely that most of the next actions you deter mine for things in \n\"in\" will be yours to do and will take longer than two minutes to \ncomplete. A call you need to make to a customer; an  e-mail you \nneed to spend a little time thinking about and draf ting to your \nteam; a gift you need to buy for your brother at th e stationery \nstore; a piece of software you need to download fro m the Web and \n135 \n136 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  I  PART TWO \ntry out; a conversation you must have with your spo use about an \ninvestment you think you should make—all of these f it that \ndescription. \nThese actions will have to be written down somewher e and \nthen organized in the appropriate categories so you  can access \nthem when you need to. For the moment, go ahead and  put Post- \nits on the pieces of paper in \"in,\" with the action  written on them, \nand add these to the \"Pending\" stack of papers that  have been \nprocessed. \nThe \"Pending\" Things That Are Left \nIf you follow the instructions in this chapter, you 'll dump a mess \nof things, file a bunch, do a lot of two-minute act ions, and hand \noff a number of items to other people. You'll also wind up with \na stack of items that have actions associated with them that you \nstill need to do—soon, someday, or on a specific da te—and \nreminders of things you're waiting on from other pe ople. This \n\"Pending\" group is made up of the actions you've de legated or \ndeferred. It is what still needs to be organized in  some fashion in \nyour personal system, a topic I'll cover in step-by -step detail \nin the next chapter. \nIdentifying the Projects You Have \nThis last step in getting to the bottom of \"in\" req uires a shift in \nperspective from the single-action details to the l arger picture—\nyour projects. \nAgain, I define a \"project\" as any outcome you're c ommitted \nto achieving that will take more than one action st ep to complete. \nIf you look through an inventory of actions that yo u have already \nbeen generating—\"Call Frank about the car alarm\"; \" E-mail \nBernadette re conference materials\"—you'll no doubt  recognize a \nnumber of things that are larger than the single ac tion you've \ndefined. There's still going to be something about \"car alarm\" to \nCHAPTER 6  |  PROCESSING: GETTING \"IN\" TO EMPTY \ndo after the call to Frank, and there will still be  something to han- \ndle about the conference after the e-mail to Bernad ette. \nI hope you're able to see the very practical reason  for defining \nprojects as broadly as I do: If the action step you 've identified will \nnot complete the commitment, then you'll need \nsome stake in the ground to keep reminding you \nof actions you have pending",

As I will walk you through  in the next \nchapter, about organizing, you'll see that a significant category to \nmanage is \"Waiting For.\" \nAs you develop your own customized system, what you\neventually hand off and then track could look like a list in a plan- \nner, a file folder holding separate papers for each  item, and/or a \nlist categorized as \"Waiting For\" in your software.  For now, if you \ndon't have a trusted system set up already, just pu t a note on a \npiece of paper—\"W/F: reply from Bob\"—and put that i nto a \n\"Pending\" stack of notes in a separate pile or tray  that may result \nfrom your processing. \nWhat If the Ball Is Already in Someone Else's Court ? In the exam- \nple cited above about waiting for the last K-l to c ome in so you \ncan do your taxes, the next action is currently on someone else's \nplate. In such situations you will also want to tra ck the action as a \ndelegated item, or as a \"Waiting For.\" On the paper  that says \"Do \nmy taxes,\" write something like \"Waiting for K-l fr om Acme \nTrust\" and put that into your \"Pending\" stack. \nIt's important that you record the date on everythi ng you \nhand off to others. This, of all the categories in your personal sys- \ntem, is the most crucial one to keep tabs on. The f ew times you \nwill actually want to refer to that information (\"B ut I called and \nordered that on March 12\") will make it worth estab lishing this as \na lifelong habit. \nDefer It \nIt's likely that most of the next actions you deter mine for things in \n\"in\" will be yours to do and will take longer than two minutes to \ncomplete.

For the moment, go ahead and  put Post- \nits on the pieces of paper in \"in,\" with the action  written on them, \nand add these to the \"Pending\" stack of papers that  have been \nprocessed. \nThe \"Pending\" Things That Are Left \nIf you follow the instructions in this chapter, you 'll dump a mess \nof things, file a bunch, do a lot of two-minute act ions, and hand \noff a number of items to other people. You'll also wind up with \na stack of items that have actions associated with them that you \nstill need to do—soon, someday, or on a specific da te—and \nreminders of things you're waiting on from other pe ople. This \n\"Pending\" group is made up of the actions you've de legated or \ndeferred. It is what still needs to be organized in  some fashion in \nyour personal system, a topic I'll cover in step-by -step detail \nin the next chapter. \nIdentifying the Projects You Have \nThis last step in getting to the bottom of \"in\" req uires a shift in \nperspective from the single-action details to the l arger picture—\nyour projects. \nAgain, I define a \"project\" as any outcome you're c ommitted \nto achieving that will take more than one action st ep to complete. \nIf you look through an inventory of actions that yo u have already \nbeen generating—\"Call Frank about the car alarm\"; \" E-mail \nBernadette re conference materials\"—you'll no doubt  recognize a \nnumber of things that are larger than the single ac tion you've \ndefined. There's still going to be something about \"car alarm\" to \nCHAPTER 6  |  PROCESSING: GETTING \"IN\" TO EMPTY \ndo after the call to Frank, and there will still be  something to han- \ndle about the conference after the e-mail to Bernad ette. \nI hope you're able to see",

A \"Projects\" l ist \nmay include anything from \"Give holiday party\" to \n\"Divest the Widget product line\" to \"Finalize com- \npensation package.\" The purpose of this list is not  to \nreflect your priorities but just to ensure that you 've \ngot placeholders for all those open loops. \nWhether you draw up your \"Projects\" list while you' re ini- \ntially processing your in-basket or after you've se t up your action \nlists doesn't really matter. It just needs to be do ne at some point, \nand it must be maintained, as it's the key driver f or reviewing \nwhere you are and where you want to be. \nFor now, let's make sure your organizing setup is \" all sys- \ntems go.\" \n137 Right now you \nprobably have \nbetween thirty and a \nhundred projects.",

A \"Projects\" l ist \nmay include anything from \"Give holiday party\" to \n\"Divest the Widget product line\" to \"Finalize com- \npensation package.\" The purpose of this list is not  to \nreflect your priorities but just to ensure that you 've \ngot placeholders for all those open loops. \nWhether you draw up your \"Projects\" list while you' re ini- \ntially processing your in-basket or after you've se t up your action \nlists doesn't really matter. It just needs to be do ne at some point, \nand it must be maintained, as it's the key driver f or reviewing \nwhere you are and where you want to be. \nFor now, let's make sure your organizing setup is \" all sys- \ntems go.\" \n137 Right now you \nprobably have \nbetween thirty and a \nhundred projects.",

A \"Projects\" l ist \nmay include anything from \"Give holiday party\" to \n\"Divest the Widget product line\" to \"Finalize com- \npensation package.\" The purpose of this list is not  to \nreflect your priorities but just to ensure that you 've \ngot placeholders for all those open loops. \nWhether you draw up your \"Projects\" list while you' re ini- \ntially processing your in-basket or after you've se t up your action \nlists doesn't really matter. It just needs to be do ne at some point, \nand it must be maintained, as it's the key driver f or reviewing \nwhere you are and where you want to be. \nFor now, let's make sure your organizing setup is \" all sys- \ntems go.\" \n137 Right now you \nprobably have \nbetween thirty and a \nhundred projects.",
