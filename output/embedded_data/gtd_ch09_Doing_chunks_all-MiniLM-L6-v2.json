Your choices will still have to be calibr ated \nagainst your own clarity about the nature and goals\nof your work. \nYour ability to deal with surprise is your com- \npetitive edge. But at a certain point, if you're no t \ncatching up and getting things under control, stayi ng \nbusy with only the work at hand will undermine your\neffectiveness. And ultimately, in order to know whe ther you \nshould stop what you're doing and do something else , you'll need \nto have to have a good sense of what your job requi res and how \nthat fits into the other contexts of your life. The  only way you can \nhave that is to evaluate your life and work appropr iately at multi- \nple horizons. \nThe Six-Level Model for \nReviewing Your Own Work \nThe six levels of work as we saw in chapter 2 (page s 51-53) may \nbe thought of in terms of altitude: \n• 50,000+feet: Life \n• 40,000 feet: Three- to five-year visions \n• 30,000 feet: One- to two-year goals \n• 20,000 feet: Areas of responsibility \n• 10,000 feet: Current projects \n• Runway: Current actions \nIt makes sense that each of these levels should enh ance and \nalign with the ones above it. In other words, your priorities will sit \nin a hierarchy from the top down. Ultimately, if th e phone call \nyou're supposed to make clashes with your life purp ose or values, \nto be in sync with yourself you won't make it. If y our job structure \n200 Do ad hoc work as \nit shows up, not \nbecause it is the \npath of least resis- \ntance, but because \nit is the thing you \nneed to do, vis-a-vis \nall the rest. \nCHAPTER 9  |  DOING: MAKING THE BEST ACTION CHOICES \ndoesn't match up with where you need to be a year f rom now, \nyou should rethink how you've framed your areas of focus and \nresponsibilities, if you want to get where you're g oing most effi- \nciently. \nLet's look at that first example from the bottom up . The \nphone call you need to make (action) is about the d eal you're \nworking on (project), which would increase sales (r esponsibility). \nThis particular deal would give you the opportunity  to move up in \nthe sales force (job goal) because of the new marke t \nyour company wants to penetrate (organization visio n). \nAnd that would get you closer to the way you want t o \nbe living, both financially and professionally (lif e). \nOr, from the other direction, you've decided \nthat you want to be your own boss and unlock some o f \nyour unique assets and talents in a particular area  that \nresonates with you (life). So you create a business  for \nyourself (vision), with some short-term key operati onal objec- \ntives (job goal). That gives you some critical role s you need to \nfulfill to get it rolling (responsibility), with so me immediate \noutcomes to achieve (projects). On each of those pr ojects you'll \nhave things you need to do, as soon as you can do t hem (next \nactions). \nThe healthiest approach for relaxed control and ins pired \nproductivity is to manage all the levels in a balan ced fashion. At \nany of these levels, it's critical to identify all the open loops, all the \nincompletions, and all the commitments that you hav e right now, \nas best you can. Without an acceptance and an objec tive assess- \nment of what's true in the present, it's always dif ficult to cast off \nfor new shores. What's on your answering machine? W hat are \nyour projects relative to your kids? What are you r esponsible for in \nthe office? What's pushing on you to change or attr acting you to \ncreate in the next months or years? These are all o pen loops in \nyour psyche, though often it takes deeper and more introspective \nprocesses to identify the bigger goals and subtler inclinations. \nThere is magic in being in the present in your life . I'm always \n201 Your work is to \ndiscover your work \nand then with all \nyour heart to give \nyourself to it. \n—\nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY |  PART TWO \namazed at",

    "text": "PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY I  PART TWO \non a conference call. But you must learn to dance \namong many tasks to keep a healthy balance of your \nworkflow. Your choices will still have to be calibr ated \nagainst your own clarity about the nature and goals\nof your work. \nYour ability to deal with surprise is your com- \npetitive edge. But at a certain point, if you're no t \ncatching up and getting things under control, stayi ng \nbusy with only the work at hand will undermine your\neffectiveness. And ultimately, in order to know whe ther you \nshould stop what you're doing and do something else , you'll need \nto have to have a good sense of what your job requi res and how \nthat fits into the other contexts of your life. The  only way you can \nhave that is to evaluate your life and work appropr iately at multi- \nple horizons. \nThe Six-Level Model for \nReviewing Your Own Work \nThe six levels of work as we saw in chapter 2 (page s 51-53) may \nbe thought of in terms of altitude: \n• 50,000+feet: Life \n• 40,000 feet: Three- to five-year visions \n• 30,000 feet: One- to two-year goals \n• 20,000 feet: Areas of responsibility \n• 10,000 feet: Current projects \n• Runway: Current actions \nIt makes sense that each of these levels should enh ance and \nalign with the ones above it. In other words, your priorities will sit \nin a hierarchy from the top down. Ultimately, if th e phone call \nyou're supposed to make clashes with your life purp ose or values, \nto be in sync with yourself you won't make it. If y our job structure \n200 Do ad hoc work as \nit shows up, not \nbecause it is the \npath of least resis- \ntance, but because \nit is the thing you \nneed to do, vis-a-vis \nall the rest. \nCHAPTER 9  |  DOING: MAKING THE BEST ACTION CHOICES \ndoesn't match up with where you need to be a year f rom now, \nyou should rethink how you've framed your areas of focus and \nresponsibilities, if you want to get where you're g oing most effi- \nciently.",

    "text": " match up with where you need to be a year f rom now, \nyou should rethink how you've framed your areas of focus and \nresponsibilities, if you want to get where you're g oing most effi- \nciently. \nLet's look at that first example from the bottom up . The \nphone call you need to make (action) is about the d eal you're \nworking on (project), which would increase sales (r esponsibility). \nThis particular deal would give you the opportunity  to move up in \nthe sales force (job goal) because of the new marke t \nyour company wants to penetrate (organization visio n). \nAnd that would get you closer to the way you want t o \nbe living, both financially and professionally (lif e). \nOr, from the other direction, you've decided \nthat you want to be your own boss and unlock some o f \nyour unique assets and talents in a particular area  that \nresonates with you (life). So you create a business  for \nyourself (vision), with some short-term key operati onal objec- \ntives (job goal). That gives you some critical role s you need to \nfulfill to get it rolling (responsibility), with so me immediate \noutcomes to achieve (projects). On each of those pr ojects you'll \nhave things you need to do, as soon as you can do t hem (next \nactions). \nThe healthiest approach for relaxed control and ins pired \nproductivity is to manage all the levels in a balan ced fashion. At \nany of these levels, it's critical to identify all the open loops, all the \nincompletions, and all the commitments that you hav e right now, \nas best you can. Without an acceptance and an objec tive assess- \nment of what's true in the present, it's always dif ficult to cast off \nfor new shores. What's on your answering machine? W hat are \nyour projects relative to your kids? What are you r esponsible for in \nthe office? What's pushing on you to change or attr acting you to \ncreate in the next months or years? These are all o pen loops in \nyour psyche, though often it takes deeper and more introspective \nprocesses to identify the bigger goals and subtler inclinations. \nThere is magic in being in the present in your life .",

That gives you some critical role s you need to \nfulfill to get it rolling (responsibility), with so me immediate \noutcomes to achieve (projects). On each of those pr ojects you'll \nhave things you need to do, as soon as you can do t hem (next \nactions). \nThe healthiest approach for relaxed control and ins pired \nproductivity is to manage all the levels in a balan ced fashion. At \nany of these levels, it's critical to identify all the open loops, all the \nincompletions, and all the commitments that you hav e right now, \nas best you can. Without an acceptance and an objec tive assess- \nment of what's true in the present, it's always dif ficult to cast off \nfor new shores. What's on your answering machine? W hat are \nyour projects relative to your kids? What are you r esponsible for in \nthe office? What's pushing on you to change or attr acting you to \ncreate in the next months",

Finding out the\nexact details of your personal finances, clarifying  the \nhistorical data about the company you're buying, or\ngetting the facts about who really said what to who m \nin an interpersonal conflict can be constructive, i f not \ndownright healing. \nGetting things done, and feeling good about it, mea ns being \nwilling to recognize, acknowledge, and appropriatel y manage all \nthe things that have your consciousness engaged. Ma stering the \nart of stress-free productivity requires it. \nWorking from the Bottom Up \nIn order to create productive alignment in your lif e, you could quite \nreasonably start with a clarification from the top down. Decide why \nyou're on the planet. Figure out what kind of life and \nwork and life-style would best allow you to fulfill  that \ncontract. What kind of job and personal relationshi ps \nwould support that direction? What key things would\nyou need to put in place and make happen right now,\nand what could you do physically as soon as possibl e, \nto kick-start each of those? \nIn truth, you can approach your priorities from \nany level, at any time. I always have something tha t I \ncould do constructively to enhance my awareness and  focus on \neach level. I'm never lacking in more visions to el aborate, goals to \nreassess, projects to identify or create, or action s to decide on. The \ntrick is to learn to pay attention to the ones you need to at the \nappropriate time, to keep you and your systems in b alance. \nBecause everything will ultimately be driven by the  priorities \nof the level above it, any formulation of your prio rities would \nobviously most efficiently begin at the top. For ex ample, if you \nspend time prioritizing your work and then later di scover that it's \nnot the work you think you ought to be doing, you m ay have \n\"wasted\" time and energy that could have been bette r spent defin- \n202 The best place to \nsucceed is where \nyou are with what \nyou have. \n—Charles \nYou're never lacking \nin opportunities to \nclarify your \npriorities at any \nlevel. Pay attention \nto which horizon is \ncalling you. \nCHAPTER 9 1  DOING: MAKING THE BEST ACTION CHOICES \ning the next job you really want. The problem is th at without a \nsense of control at the implementation levels (curr ent projects and \nactions), and without inner trust in your own abili ty to manage \nthose levels appropriately, trying to manage yourse lf from the top \ndown often creates frustration. \nFrom a practical perspective, I suggest going \nfrom the bottom up instead. I've coached people \nfrom both directions, and in terms of lasting value , I \ncan honestly say that getting someone in control of\nthe details of his or her current physical world, a nd \nthen elevating the focus from there, has never \nmissed. \nThe primary reason to work from this bottom- \nup direction is that it clears the psychic decks to  begin with, \nallowing your creative attention to focus on the mo re meaningful \nand elusive visions that you may need to challenge yourself to \nidentify. Also, this particular method has a high d egree of flexibil- \nity and freedom, and it includes a thinking and org anizing prac- \ntice that is universal and effective no matter what  it's focused on. \nThat makes it worth learning, no matter what the ac tual content \nyou're dealing with at the moment may be. Change yo ur mind, \nand this process will help you adjust with maximum speed. And \nknowing that you have that ability will give you pe rmission to \nplay a bigger game. It's truly empowering. \nWhile the \"50,000-foot level\" is obviously the most  important \ncontext within which to set priorities, experience has shown me \nthat when we understand and implement all the levels of work \nin which we are engaged, especially the runway and 10,000-foot \nlevels, we gain greater freedom and resources to do  the bigger \nwork that we're all about. Although a bottom-up app roach is \nnot a key conceptual priority, from a practical per spective it's \na critical factor in achieving a balanced, producti ve, and comfort- \nable life. \n203 Trying to manage \nfrom the top down,\nwhen the bottom is \nout of control, may \nbe the least\neffective approach.\nPRACTICING",

Finding out the\nexact details of your personal finances, clarifying  the \nhistorical data about the company you're buying, or\ngetting the facts about who really said what to who m \nin an interpersonal conflict can be constructive, i f not \ndownright healing. \nGetting things done, and feeling good about it, mea ns being \nwilling to recognize, acknowledge, and appropriatel y manage all \nthe things that have your consciousness engaged. Ma stering the \nart of stress-free productivity requires it. \nWorking from the Bottom Up \nIn order to create productive alignment in your lif e, you could quite \nreasonably start with a clarification from the top down. Decide why \nyou're on the planet. Figure out what kind of life and \nwork and life-style would best allow you to fulfill  that \ncontract. What kind of job and personal relationshi ps \nwould support that direction? What key things would\nyou need to put in place and make happen right now,\nand what could you do physically as soon as possibl e, \nto kick-start each of those? \nIn truth, you can approach your priorities from \nany level, at any time. I always have something tha t I \ncould do constructively to enhance my awareness and  focus on \neach level. I'm never lacking in more visions to el aborate, goals to \nreassess, projects to identify or create, or action s to decide on. The \ntrick is to learn to pay attention to the ones you need to at the \nappropriate time, to keep you and your systems in b alance. \nBecause everything will ultimately be driven by the  priorities \nof the level above it, any formulation of your prio rities would \nobviously most efficiently begin at the top. For ex ample, if you \nspend time prioritizing your work and then later di scover that it's \nnot the work you think you ought to be doing, you m ay have \n\"wasted\" time and energy that could have been bette r spent defin- \n202 The best place to \nsucceed is where \nyou are with what \nyou have.",

Pay attention \nto which horizon is \ncalling you. \nCHAPTER 9 1  DOING: MAKING THE BEST ACTION CHOICES \ning the next job you really want. The problem is th at without a \nsense of control at the implementation levels (curr ent projects and \nactions), and without inner trust in your own abili ty to manage \nthose levels appropriately, trying to manage yourse lf from the top \ndown often creates frustration. \nFrom a practical perspective, I suggest going \nfrom the bottom up instead. I've coached people \nfrom both directions, and in terms of lasting value , I \ncan honestly say that getting someone in control of\nthe details of his or her current physical world, a nd \nthen elevating the focus from there, has never \nmissed. \nThe primary reason to work from this bottom- \nup direction is that it clears the psychic decks to  begin with, \nallowing your creative attention to focus on the mo re meaningful \nand elusive visions that you may need to challenge yourself to \nidentify. Also, this particular method has a high d egree of flexibil- \nity and freedom, and it includes a thinking and org anizing prac- \ntice that is universal and effective no matter what  it's focused on. \nThat makes it worth learning, no matter what the ac tual content \nyou're dealing with at the moment may be. Change yo ur mind, \nand this process will help you adjust with maximum speed. And \nknowing that you have that ability will give you pe rmission to \nplay a bigger game. It's truly empowering. \nWhile the \"50,000-foot level\" is obviously the most  important \ncontext within which to set priorities, experience has shown me \nthat when we understand and implement all the levels of work \nin which we are engaged, especially the runway and 10,000-foot \nlevels, we gain greater freedom and resources to do  the bigger \nwork that we're all about. Although a bottom-up app roach is \nnot a key conceptual priority, from a practical per spective it's \na critical",

Thos e who focus on \ngathering and objectifying all of those items disco ver that there \nare many they've forgotten, misplaced, or just not recognized. \nAside from your calendar, if you don't have at leas t fifty next \nactions and waiting-fors, including all the agendas  for people and \nmeetings, I would be skeptical about whether you re ally had all of \nthem. If you've followed through rigorously with th e steps and \nsuggestions in part 2, though, you may have them al ready. If not, \nand you do want to get this level up-to-date, set a side some time \nto work through chapters 4 through 6 in real implem entation \nmode. \nWhen you've finished getting this level of control current, \nyou'll automatically have a more grounded sense of immediate \npriorities, which is almost impossible to achieve o therwise. \n10,000 Feet Finalize your \"Projects\" list. Does it \ntruly capture all the commitments you have that wil l \nrequire more than one action to get done? That will\ndefine the boundaries of the kind of week-to-week \noperational world you're in and allow you to relax \nyour thinking for longer intervals. \nIf you make a complete list of all of the things \nyou want to have happen in your life and work at th is \nlevel, you'll discover that there are actions you n eed \nto do that you hadn't realized. Just creating this objective inven- \ntory will give you a firmer basis on which to make decisions about \nwhat to do when you have discretionary time. Invari ably when \npeople get their \"Projects\" list up-to-date, they d iscover there are \nseveral things that could be done readily to move t hings they care \nabout forward. \nVery few people have this clear data defined and av ailable to \nthemselves in some objective form. Before any discu ssion about \nwhat should be done this afternoon can take place, this informa- \ntion must be at hand. \n204 Taking the inventory \nof your current \nwork at all levels \nwill automatically \nproduce greater \nfocus, alignment, \nand sense of \npriorities. \nCHAPTER 9  |  DOING: MAKING THE BEST ACTION CHOICES \nAgain, if you've been putting into practice the met hodology \nof Getting Things Done, your \"Projects\" list will be where it needs \nto be. For most of our coaching clients, it takes t en to fifteen \nhours of collecting, processing, and organizing to get to the point \nof trusting the thoroughness of their inventory. \n20,000 Feet This is the level of \"current job responsibilities. \" \nWhat are the \"hats\" you wear? Professionally, this would relate to \nyour current position and work. Personally, it woul d include the \nroles you've taken on in your family, in your commu nity, and of \ncourse with yourself as a functioning person. \nYou may have some of these roles already defined an d \nwritten out. If you've recently taken a new positio n and there's \nan agreement or contract about your areas of respon sibility, \n that would certainly be a good start. If you've do ne any kind \nof personal goal-setting and values-clarifying exer cises in the \npast and still have any materials you created then,  add those to the \nmix. \nNext I recommend that you make and keep a list call ed \n\"Areas of Focus.\" You might like to separate this i nto \"Profes- \nsional\" and \"Personal\" sublists, in which case you' ll want to use \nthem both equally for a consistent review This is o ne of the most \nuseful checklists you can create for your own self- management. It \nwon't require the kind of once-a-week recalibration\nthat the \"Projects\" list will; more likely it will have \nmeaning on a longer recursion cycle. Depending on \nthe speed of change in some of the more important \nareas of your life and work, this should be used as  a \ntrigger for potential new projects every one to thr ee \nmonths. \nYou probably have somewhere between four and seven key \nareas of responsibility in your work, and a similar  number person- \nally. Your job may include things like staff develo pment, systems \ndesign, long-range planning",

Thos e who focus on \ngathering and objectifying all of those items disco ver that there \nare many they've forgotten, misplaced, or just not recognized. \nAside from your calendar, if you don't have at leas t fifty next \nactions and waiting-fors, including all the agendas  for people and \nmeetings, I would be skeptical about whether you re ally had all of \nthem. If you've followed through rigorously with th e steps and \nsuggestions in part 2, though, you may have them al ready. If not, \nand you do want to get this level up-to-date, set a side some time \nto work through chapters 4 through 6 in real implem entation \nmode. \nWhen you've finished getting this level of control current, \nyou'll automatically have a more grounded sense of immediate \npriorities, which is almost impossible to achieve o therwise. \n10,000 Feet Finalize your \"Projects\" list. Does it \ntruly capture all the commitments you have that wil l \nrequire more than one action to get done? That will\ndefine the boundaries of the kind of week-to-week \noperational world you're in and allow you to relax \nyour thinking for longer intervals. \nIf you make a complete list of all of the things \nyou want to have happen in your life and work at th is \nlevel, you'll discover that there are actions you n eed \nto do that you hadn't realized. Just creating this objective inven- \ntory will give you a firmer basis on which to make decisions about \nwhat to do when you have discretionary time. Invari ably when \npeople get their \"Projects\" list up-to-date, they d iscover there are \nseveral things that could be done readily to move t hings they care \nabout forward. \nVery few people have this clear data defined and av ailable to \nthemselves in some objective form. Before any discu ssion about \nwhat should be done this afternoon",

Professionally, this would relate to \nyour current position and work. Personally, it woul d include the \nroles you've taken on in your family, in your commu nity, and of \ncourse with yourself as a functioning person. \nYou may have some of these roles already defined an d \nwritten out. If you've recently taken a new positio n and there's \nan agreement or contract about your areas of respon sibility, \n that would certainly be a good start. If you've do ne any kind \nof personal goal-setting and values-clarifying exer cises in the \npast and still have any materials you created then,  add those to the \nmix. \nNext I recommend that you make and keep a list call ed \n\"Areas of Focus.\" You might like to separate this i nto \"Profes- \nsional\" and \"Personal\" sublists, in which case you' ll want to use \nthem both equally for a consistent review This is o ne of the most \nuseful checklists you can create for your own self- management. It \nwon't require the kind of once-a-week recalibration\nthat the \"Projects\" list will; more likely it will have \nmeaning on a longer recursion cycle.

Your job may include things like staff develo pment, systems \ndesign, long-range planning, administrative support , marketing, \nand scheduling, or responsibility for facilities, f ulfillment, quality \n205 If you're not totally \nsure what your job \nis, it will always feel\noverwhelming.\n206 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY |  PAHT TWO \ncontrol, asset management, and so on. If you're you r own busi- \nness, your attention will be on many more areas tha n if you have a \nvery specialized function in a large organization. The rest of your \nlife might entail areas of focus such as parenting,  partnering, \nchurch, health, community service, home management,  financial \nmanagement, self-development, creative expression, and so forth. \nThe operational purpose of the \"Areas of Focus\" lis t is to \nensure that you have all your projects and next act ions defined, so \nyou can manage your responsibilities appropriately.  If you were to \ncreate an accounting of those and evaluate them obj ectively, in \nterms of what you're doing and should be doing, you 'll undoubtedly \nuncover projects you need to add to your \"Projects\"  list. You may, in \nreviewing the list, decide that some areas are just  fine and are being \ntaken care of. Then again, you may realize that som ething has been \n\"bugging\" you in one area and that a project should  be created to \nshore it up. \"Areas of Focus\" is really just a more  abstract and refined \nversion of the \"Triggers\" list we covered earlier. \nEvery client I have coached in the last twenty year s has \nuncovered at least one important gap at this level of discussion. \nFor instance, a common \"hat\" a manager or executive  wears is \n\"staff development.\" Upon reflection, most realize they need to add \na project or two in that area, such as \"Upgrade our  performance- \nreview process.\" \nA discussion of \"priorities\" would have to incorpor ate all of \nthese levels of current agreements between yourself  and others. If \nyou get this \"job description\" checklist in play an d keep it current, \nyou'll probably be more relaxed and in control than  most people \nin our culture. It will certainly go a long way tow ard moving you \nfrom hope to trust as you make the necessary on-the -run choices \nabout what to do. \n30,000 to 50,000+ Feet Whereas the three lower levels have \nmostly to do with the current state of things—your actions, proj- \nects, and areas of responsibility—from here up the factors of the \nfuture and your direction and intentions are primar y. There is still \nCHAPTER 9  I  DOING: MAKING THE BEST ACTION CHOICES \nan inventory to take at these plateaus, but it's mo re \nabout \"What is true right now about where I've \ndecided I'm going and how I'm going to get there?\" \nThis can range from one-year goals in your job \n(\"30,000 feet\") to a three-year vision for your car eer \nand personal net worth (\"40,000 feet\") to intuiting\nyour life purpose and how to maximize its expressio n \n(\"50,000+ feet\"). \nI'm blending the three uppermost levels together he re \nbecause situations often can't easily be pigeonhole d into one or \nanother of these categories. Also, since Getting Things Done is \nmore about the art of implementation than about how  to define \ngoals and vision, I won't offer a rigorous examinat ion here. But by \nits very nature this investigation can broach poten tially deep and \ncomplex arenas, which could include business strate gy, organiza- \ntion development, career planning, and life directi on and values. \nFor our purposes, the focus is on capturing what mo tivators \nexist for you in current reality that determine the  inventory of \nwhat your work actually is, right now. Whether your  directions \nand goals should be changed—based on deeper thinkin g, analysis, \nand intuition—could be another discussion. Even so,  there are \nprobably some things you can identify right now tha t can help \nyou get current in your own thinking about your wor k and what's \nimportant in it. \nIf you were to intuitively frame a picture of what you think \nyou might be doing twelve to eighteen months from n ow, or what \nthe nature of your job will look like at that point , what would that \ntrigger? At this level, which is subtler, there may  be things person- \nally you need to",

If you're you r own busi- \nness, your attention will be on many more areas tha n if you have a \nvery specialized function in a large organization. The rest of your \nlife might entail areas of focus such as parenting,  partnering, \nchurch, health, community service, home management,  financial \nmanagement, self-development, creative expression, and so forth. \nThe operational purpose of the \"Areas of Focus\" lis t is to \nensure that you have all your projects and next act ions defined, so \nyou can manage your responsibilities appropriately.  If you were to \ncreate an accounting of those and evaluate them obj ectively, in \nterms of what you're doing and should be doing, you 'll undoubtedly \nuncover projects you need to add to your \"Projects\"  list. You may, in \nreviewing the list, decide that some areas are just  fine and are being \ntaken care of. Then again, you may realize that som ething has been \n\"bugging\" you in one area and that a project should  be created to \nshore it up. \"Areas of Focus\" is really just a more  abstract and refined \nversion of the \"Triggers\" list we covered earlier. \nEvery client I have coached in the last twenty year s has \nuncovered at least one important gap at this level of discussion. \nFor instance, a common \"hat\" a manager or executive  wears is \n\"staff development.\" Upon reflection, most realize they need to add \na project or two in that area, such as \"Upgrade our  performance- \nreview process.\" \nA discussion of \"priorities\" would have to incorpor ate all of \nthese levels of current agreements between yourself  and others. If \nyou get this \"job description\" checklist in play an d keep it current, \nyou'll probably be more relaxed and in control than  most",

If \nyou get this \"job description\" checklist in play an d keep it current, \nyou'll probably be more relaxed and in control than  most people \nin our culture. It will certainly go a long way tow ard moving you \nfrom hope to trust as you make the necessary on-the -run choices \nabout what to do. \n30,000 to 50,000+ Feet Whereas the three lower levels have \nmostly to do with the current state of things—your actions, proj- \nects, and areas of responsibility—from here up the factors of the \nfuture and your direction and intentions are primar y. There is still \nCHAPTER 9  I  DOING: MAKING THE BEST ACTION CHOICES \nan inventory to take at these plateaus, but it's mo re \nabout \"What is true right now about where I've \ndecided I'm going and how I'm going to get there?\" \nThis can range from one-year goals in your job \n(\"30,000 feet\") to a three-year vision for your car eer \nand personal net worth (\"40,000 feet\") to intuiting\nyour life purpose and how to maximize its expressio n \n(\"50,000+ feet\"). \nI'm blending the three uppermost levels together he re \nbecause situations often can't easily be pigeonhole d into one or \nanother of these categories. Also, since Getting Things Done is \nmore about the art of implementation than about how  to define \ngoals and vision, I won't offer a rigorous examinat ion here. But by \nits very nature this investigation can broach poten tially deep and \ncomplex arenas, which could include business strate gy, organiza- \ntion development, career planning, and life directi on and values. \nFor our purposes, the focus is on capturing what mo tivators \nexist for you in current reality that determine the  inventory of \nwhat your work actually is, right now. Whether your  directions \nand goals should be changed—based on deeper thinkin g, analysis, \nand intuition—could be another discussion. Even so,  there are \nprobably some things you can identify right now tha t can help \nyou get current in your own thinking about your wor k and what's \nimportant in it. \nIf you were to intuitively frame a picture of what you think \nyou might be doing",

    "text": " twelve to eighteen months from n ow, or what \nthe nature of your job will look like at that point , what would that \ntrigger? At this level, which is subtler, there may  be things person- \nally you need to let go of, and people and systems that may need \nto be developed to allow the transition. And as the  job itself is a \nmoving target, given the shifting sands of the prof essional world \nthese days, there may need to be projects defined t o ensure via- \nbility of the outputs in your area. \nIn the personal arena, this is where you would want  to con- \nsider things like: \"My career is going to stagnate unless I assert my \n207 When you're not\nsure where you're \ngoing, you'll never \nknow when enough \nis enough.\n208 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  I  PART TWO \nown goals more specifically to my boss (or my boss' s boss).\" Or \n\"What new things are my children going to be doing next year, \nand what do I need to do differently because of tha t?\" Or \"What \npreparation do I need to ensure that I can deal wit h this health \nproblem we've just uncovered?\" \nThrough a longer scope you might assess: How is you r career \ngoing? How is your personal life moving along? What  is your \norganization doing relative to changes in the envir onment, and \nwhat impact does that have on you? These are the on e-to-five- \nyear-horizon questions that, when I ask them, elici t different and \nimportant kinds of answers from everyone. \nNot long ago I coached someone in a large internati onal \nbank who, after a few months of implementing this m ethodology \nand getting control of his day-to-day inventory of work, decided \nthe time was right to invest in his own start-up hi gh-tech firm. \nThe thought had been too intimidating for him to ad dress ini- \ntially, but working from the \"runway level\" up made  it much more \naccessible and a natural consequence of thinking at  this horizon. \nIf you're involved in anything that has a future of  longer than \na year (marriage, kids, a career, a company, an art  form), you would \ndo well to think about what you might need to be do ing to man- \nage things along that vector. \nQuestions to ask yourself here are: \n• What are the longer-term goals and objectives in my\norganization, and what projects do I need to have i n place \nrelated to them to fulfill my responsibilities? \n• What longer-term goals and objectives have I set fo r myself, \nand what projects do I need to have in place to mak e them \nhappen? \n• What other significant things are happening that co uld affect \nmy options about what you I'm doing? \nCHAPTER 9  |  DOING: MAKING THE BEST ACTION CHOICES \nHere are some examples of the kinds of issues that show up \nat this level of conversation: \n• The changing nature of your job, given the shifting  priorities of \nthe company. Instead of managing the production of your own \ntraining programs in-house, you're going to outsour ce them to \nvendors. \n• The direction in which you feel you need to move in  your \ncareer. You see yourself doing a different kind of job a year \nfrom now, and you need to make a transition out of the one \nyou have while exploring the options for a transfer  or \npromotion. \n• The organization direction, given globalization and  expansion. \nYou see a lot of major international travel looming  on the \nhorizon for you, and given your life-style preferen ces, you need \nto consider how to readjust your career plans. \n• Life-style preferences and changing needs. As your kids get \nolder, your need to be at home with them is diminis hing, and \nyour interest in investment and retirement planning  is growing. \nAt the topmost level of thinking, you'll need to as k some of \nthe ultimate questions. Why does your company exist ? Why do \nyou exist? What is the core DNA of your existence, pers onally \nand/or organizationally, that drives your choices. This is the \"big \npicture\" stuff with which hundreds of books and gur us and mod- \nels are devoted to helping you grapple. \n\"Why?\": this is the great question with which we al l struggle. \nYou can have all the other levels of your life and work ship- \nshape, defined, and organized to a T. Still, if you 're the slightest \nbit off course in terms of what at the deepest leve l you want or are \ncalled to be doing, you're going to be uncomfortabl e.",

This is the \"big \npicture\" stuff with which hundreds of books and gur us and mod- \nels are devoted to helping you grapple. \n\"Why?\": this is the great question with which we al l struggle. \nYou can have all the other levels of your life and work ship- \n",

Still, if you 're the slightest \nbit off course in terms of what at the deepest leve l you want or are \ncalled to be doing, you're going to be uncomfortabl e. \n209 \n210 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  I  PART TWO \nGetting Priority Thinking Off Your Mind \nTake at least a few minutes, if you haven't already  done so, to jot \ndown some informal notes about things that occurred  to you \nwhile you've been reading this chapter. Whatever po pped into \nyour mind at these more elevated levels of your inn er radar, write \nit down and get it out of your head. \nThen process those notes. Decide whether what you w rote \ndown is something you really want to move on or not . If not, \nthrow the note away, or put it on a \"Someday/Maybe\"  list or in a \nfolder called \"Dreams and Goals I Might Get Around to at Some \nPoint.\" Perhaps you want to continue accumulating m ore of this \nkind of future thinking and would like to do the ex ercise with \nmore formality—for example, by drafting a new busin ess plan \nwith your partners, designing and writing out your idea of a \ndream life with your spouse, creating a more specif ic career map \nfor the next three years for yourself, or just gett ing a personal \ncoach who can lead you through those discussions an d thought \nprocesses. If so, put that outcome on your \"Project s\" list, and \ndecide the next action. Then do it, hand it off to get done, or put \nthe action reminder on the appropriate list. \nWith that done, you may want to turn your focus to develop- \nmental thinking about specific projects that have b een identified \nbut not fleshed out as fully as you'd like. You'll want to ensure that \nyou're set up for that kind of \"vertical\" processin g. \nGetting Projects Under Control \nCHAPTERS 4 THROUGH 9 have given you all the tricks and methods you \nneed to clear your head and make intuitive choices about what to \ndo when. That's the horizontal level—what needs you r attention \nand action across the horizontal landscape of your life. The last \npiece of the puzzle is the vertical level—the diggi ng deep and pie- \nin-the-sky thinking that can leverage your creative  brainpower. \nThat gets us back to refining and energizing our pr oject planning. \nThe Need for More Informal Planning \nAfter years of working with thousands of profession als down in \nthe trenches, I can safely say that virtually all o f us could be doing \nmore planning, more informally and more often, abou t our proj- \nects and our lives. And if we did, it would relieve  a lot of pressure \non our psyches and produce an enormous amount of cr eative out- \nput with minimal effort. \nI've discovered that the biggest improvement opport unity in \nplanning does not consist of techniques for the hig hly elaborate \nand complex kinds of project organizing that profes sional project \nmanagers sometimes use (like GANTT charts). Most of  the peo- \nple who need those already have them, or at least h ave access to \nthe training and software required to learn about t hem. The real \nneed is to capture and utilize more of the creative , proactive \nthinking we do—or could do. \n211",

Whatever po pped into \nyour mind at these more elevated levels of your inn er radar, write \nit down and get it out of your head. \nThen process those notes. Decide whether what you w rote \ndown is something you really want to move on or not . If not, \nthrow the note away, or put it on a \"Someday/Maybe\"  list or in a \nfolder called \"Dreams and Goals I Might Get Around to at Some \nPoint.\" Perhaps you want to continue accumulating m ore of this \nkind of future thinking and would like to do the ex ercise with \nmore formality—for example, by drafting a new busin ess plan \nwith your partners, designing and writing out your idea of a \ndream life with your spouse, creating a more specif ic career map \nfor the next three years for yourself, or just gett ing a personal \ncoach who can lead you through those discussions an d thought \nprocesses. If so, put that outcome on your \"Project s\" list, and \ndecide the next action. Then do it, hand it off to get done, or put \nthe action reminder on the appropriate list. \nWith that done, you may want to turn your focus to develop- \nmental thinking about specific projects that have b een identified \nbut not fleshed out as fully as you'd like. You'll want to ensure that \nyou're set up for that kind of \"vertical\" processin g. \nGetting Projects Under Control \nCHAPTERS 4 THROUGH 9 have given you all the tricks and methods you \nneed to clear your head and make intuitive choices about what to \ndo when. That's the horizontal level—what needs you r attention \nand action across the horizontal landscape of your life.

If so, put that outcome on your \"Project s\" list, and \ndecide the next action. Then do it, hand it off to get done, or put \nthe action reminder on the appropriate list. \nWith that done, you may want to turn your focus to develop- \nmental thinking about specific projects that have b een identified \nbut not fleshed out as fully as you'd like. You'll want to ensure that \nyou're set up for that kind of \"vertical\" processin g. \nGetting Projects Under Control \nCHAPTERS 4 THROUGH 9 have given you all the tricks and methods you \nneed to clear your head and make intuitive choices about what to \ndo when.",

    "text": " That's the horizontal level—what needs you r attention \nand action across the horizontal landscape of your life. The last \npiece of the puzzle is the vertical level—the diggi ng deep and pie- \nin-the-sky thinking that can leverage your creative  brainpower. \nThat gets us back to refining and energizing our pr oject planning. \nThe Need for More Informal Planning \nAfter years of working with thousands of profession als down in \nthe trenches, I can safely say that virtually all o f us could be doing \nmore planning, more informally and more often, abou t our proj- \nects and our lives. And if we did, it would relieve  a lot of pressure \non our psyches and produce an enormous amount of cr eative out- \nput with minimal effort. \nI've discovered that the biggest improvement opport unity in \nplanning does not consist of techniques for the hig hly elaborate \nand complex kinds of project organizing that profes sional project \nmanagers sometimes use (like GANTT charts). Most of  the peo- \nple who need those already have them, or at least h ave access to \nthe training and software required to learn about t hem. The real \nneed is to capture and utilize more of the creative , proactive \nthinking we do—or could do. \n211",
