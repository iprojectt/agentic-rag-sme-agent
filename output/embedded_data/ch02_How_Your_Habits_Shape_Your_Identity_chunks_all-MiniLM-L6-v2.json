F ew things can have a more\npowerful impact on your life than improving your daily\nhabits. And yet it is likely that this time next year you’ll be\ndoing the same thing rather than something better .\nIt often feels diﬀicult to keep good habits going for more\nthan a few days, even with sincere eﬀort and the occasional\nburst of motivation. Habits like exercise, meditation,\njournaling, and cooking are reasonable for a day or two and\nthen become a hassle.\nHowever , once your habits are established, they seem to\nstick around forever—especially the unwanted ones.\nDespite our best intentions, unhealthy habits like eating\njunk food, watching too much television, procrastinating,\nand smoking can feel impossible to break.\nChanging our habits is challenging for two reasons: (1)\nwe try to change the wrong thing and (2) we try to change\nour habits in the wrong way . In this chapter , I’ll address the\nﬁrst point. In the chapters that follow , I’ll answer the\nsecond.\nOur ﬁrst mistake is that we try to change the wrong\nthing. T o understand what I mean, consider that there are\nthree levels at which change can occur . You can imagine\nthem like the layers of an onion.\nTHREE LA YERS OF BEHA VIOR CHANGE\nFIGURE 3:  Ther e are three layers of behavior change: a change\nin your outcomes, a change in your pr ocesses, or a change in\nyour identity .\nThe ﬁrst layer is changing your outcomes.  This level\nis concerned with changing your results: losing weight,\npublishing a book, winning a championship. Most of the\ngoals you set are associated with this level of change.\nThe second layer is changing your process.  This\nlevel is concerned with changing your habits and systems:\nimplementing a new routine at the gym, decluttering your\ndesk for better workﬂow , developing a meditation practice.\nMost of the habits you build are associated with this level.\nThe third and deepest layer is changing your\nidentity . This level is concerned with changing your\nbeliefs: your worldview , your self -image, your judgments\nabout yourself and others. Most of the beliefs, assumptions,\nand biases you hold are associated with this level.\nOutcomes are about what you get. Processes are about\nwhat you do . Identity is about what you believe. When it\ncomes to building habits that last—when it comes to\nbuilding a system of 1 percent improvements—the problem\nis not that one level is “better” or “worse” than another . All\nlevels of change are useful in their own way . The problem is\nthe direction  of change.\nMany people begin the process of changing their habits\nby focusing on what  they want to achieve. This leads us to\noutcome-based habits. The alternative is to build identity-\nbased habits. W ith this approach, we start by focusing on\nwho we wish to become.\nOUTCOME-BASED HABITS\nIDENTITY -BASED HABITS\nFIGURE 4:  With outcome-based habits, the focus is on what you\nwant to achieve. W ith identity -based habits, the focus is on who\nyou wish to become.\nImagine two people resisting a cigarette. When oﬀered a\nsmoke, the ﬁrst person says, “No thanks. I’m trying to\nquit.” It sounds like a reasonable response, but this person\nstill believes they are a smoker who is trying to be\nsomething else. They are hoping their behavior will change\nwhile carrying around the same beliefs.\nThe second person declines by saying, “No thanks. I’m\nnot a smoker .” It’s a small diﬀerence, but this statement\nsignals a shift in identity . Smoking was part of their former\nlife, not their current one. They no longer identify as\nsomeone who smokes.\nMost people don’t even consider identity change when\nthey set out to improve. They just think, “I want to be\nskinny (outcome) and if I stick to this diet, then I’ll be\nskinny (process).” They set goals and determine the actions\nthey should take to achieve those goals without considering\nthe beliefs that drive their actions. They never shift the way\nthey look at themselves, and they don’t realize that their\nold identity can sabotage their new plans for change.\nBehind every system of actions are a system of beliefs.\nThe system of a democracy is founded on beliefs like\nfreedom, majority rule, and social equality . The system of a\ndictatorship has a very diﬀerent set of beliefs like absolute",

F ew things can have a more\npowerful impact on your life than improving your daily\nhabits. And yet it is likely that this time next year you’ll be\ndoing the same thing rather than something better .\nIt often feels diﬀicult to keep good habits going for more\nthan a few days, even with sincere eﬀort and the occasional\nburst of motivation. Habits like exercise, meditation,\njournaling, and cooking are reasonable for a day or two and\nthen become a hassle.\nHowever , once your habits are established, they seem to\nstick around forever—especially the unwanted ones.\nDespite our best intentions, unhealthy habits like eating\njunk food, watching too much television, procrastinating,\nand smoking can feel impossible to break.\nChanging our habits is challenging for two reasons: (1)\nwe try to change the wrong thing and (2) we try to change\nour habits in the wrong way . In this chapter , I’ll address the\nﬁrst point. In the chapters that follow , I’ll answer the\nsecond.\nOur ﬁrst mistake is that we try to change the wrong\nthing. T o understand what I mean, consider that there are\nthree levels at which change can occur . You can imagine\nthem like the layers of an onion.\nTHREE LA YERS OF BEHA VIOR CHANGE\nFIGURE 3:  Ther e are three layers of behavior change: a change\nin your outcomes, a change in your pr ocesses, or a change in\nyour identity .\nThe ﬁrst layer is changing your outcomes.  This level\nis concerned with changing your results: losing weight,\npublishing a book, winning a championship. Most of the\ngoals you set are associated with this level of change.\nThe second layer is changing your process.  This\nlevel is concerned with changing your habits and systems:\nimplementing a new routine at the gym, decluttering your\ndesk for better workﬂow , developing a meditation practice.\nMost of the habits you build are associated with this level.\nThe third and deepest layer is changing your\nidentity . This level is concerned with changing your\nbeliefs: your worldview , your self -image, your judgments\nabout yourself and others. Most of the beliefs, assumptions,\n",

This level is concerned with changing your\nbeliefs: your worldview , your self -image, your judgments\nabout yourself and others. Most of the beliefs, assumptions,\nand biases you hold are associated with this level.\nOutcomes are about what you get. Processes are about\nwhat you do . Identity is about what you believe. When it\ncomes to building habits that last—when it comes to\nbuilding a system of 1 percent improvements—the problem\nis not that one level is “better” or “worse” than another . All\nlevels of change are useful in their own way . The problem is\nthe direction  of change.\nMany people begin the process of changing their habits\nby focusing on what  they want to achieve. This leads us to\noutcome-based habits. The alternative is to build identity-\nbased habits. W ith this approach, we start by focusing on\nwho we wish to become.\nOUTCOME-BASED HABITS\nIDENTITY -BASED HABITS\nFIGURE 4:  With outcome-based habits, the focus is on what you\nwant to achieve. W ith identity -based habits, the focus is on who\nyou wish to become.\nImagine two people resisting a cigarette. When oﬀered a\nsmoke, the ﬁrst person says, “No thanks. I’m trying to\nquit.” It sounds like a reasonable response, but this person\nstill believes they are a smoker who is trying to be\nsomething else. They are hoping their behavior will change\nwhile carrying around the same beliefs.\nThe second person declines by saying, “No thanks. I’m\nnot a smoker .” It’s a small diﬀerence, but this statement\nsignals a shift in identity . Smoking was part of their former\nlife, not their current one. They no longer identify as\nsomeone who smokes.\nMost people don’t even consider identity change when\nthey set out to improve. They just think, “I want to be\nskinny (outcome) and if I stick to this diet, then I’ll be\nskinny (process).” They set goals and determine the actions\nthey should take to achieve those goals without considering\nthe beliefs that drive their actions. They never shift the way\nthey look at themselves, and they don’t realize that their\nold identity can sabotage their new plans for change.\nBehind every system of",

This level is concerned with changing your\nbeliefs: your worldview , your self -image, your judgments\nabout yourself and others. Most of the beliefs, assumptions,\nand biases you hold are associated with this level.\nOutcomes are about what you get. Processes are about\nwhat you do . Identity is about what you believe.

All\nlevels of change are useful in their own way . The problem is\nthe direction  of change.\nMany people begin the process of changing their habits\nby focusing on what  they want to achieve.

W ith identity -based habits, the focus is on who\nyou wish to become.\nImagine two people resisting a cigarette. When oﬀered a\nsmoke, the ﬁrst person says, “No thanks. I’m trying to\nquit.” It sounds like a reasonable response, but this person\nstill believes they are a smoker who is trying to be\nsomething else. They are hoping their behavior will change\nwhile carrying around the same beliefs.\nThe second person declines by saying, “No thanks. I’m\nnot a smoker .” It’s a small diﬀerence, but this statement\nsignals a shift in identity . Smoking was part of their former\nlife, not their current one. They no longer identify as\nsomeone who smokes.\nMost people don’t even consider identity change when\nthey set out to improve. They just think, “I want to be\nskinny (outcome) and if I stick to this diet, then I’ll be\nskinny (process).” They set goals and determine the actions\n",

    "text": " actions are a system of beliefs.\nThe system of a democracy is founded on beliefs like\nfreedom, majority rule, and social equality . The system of a\ndictatorship has a very diﬀerent set of beliefs like absolute\nauthority and strict obedience. Y ou can imagine many ways\nto try to get more people to vote in a democracy , but such\nbehavior change would never get oﬀ the ground in a\ndictatorship. That’s not the identity of the system. V oting is\na behavior that is impossible under a certain set of beliefs.\nA similar pattern exists whether we are discussing\nindividuals, organizations, or societies. There are a set of\nbeliefs and assumptions that shape the system, an identity\nbehind the habits.\nBehavior that is incongruent with the self will not last.\nYou may want more money , but if your identity is someone\nwho consumes rather than creates, then you’ll continue to\nbe pulled toward spending rather than earning. Y ou may\nwant better health, but if you continue to prioritize comfort\nover accomplishment, you’ll be drawn to relaxing rather\nthan training. It’s hard to change your habits if you never\nchange the underlying beliefs that led to your past\nbehavior . You have a new goal and a new plan, but you\nhaven’t changed who you are.\nThe story of Brian Clark, an entrepreneur from Boulder ,\nColorado, provides a good example. “F or as long as I can\nremember , I’ve chewed my ﬁngernails,” Clark told me. “It\nstarted as a nervous habit when I was young, and then\nmorphed into an undesirable grooming ritual. One day , I\nresolved to stop chewing my nails until they grew out a bit.\nThrough mindful willpower alone, I managed to do it.”\nThen, Clark did something surprising.\n“I asked my wife to schedule my ﬁrst-ever manicure,” he\nsaid. “My thought was that if I started paying to maintain\nmy nails, I wouldn’t chew them. And it worked, but not for\nthe monetary reason. What happened was the manicure\nmade my ﬁngers look really nice for the ﬁrst time. The\nmanicurist even said that—other than the chewing—I had\nreally healthy , attractive nails. Suddenly , I was proud of my\nﬁngernails. And even though that’s something I had never\naspired to, it made all the diﬀerence. I’ve never chewed my\nnails since; not even a single close call. And it’s because I\nnow take pride in properly caring for them.”\nThe ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit\nbecomes part of your identity . It’s one thing to say I’m the\ntype of person who wants  this. It’s something very diﬀerent\nto say I’m the type of person who is this.\nThe more pride you have in a particular aspect of your\nidentity , the more motivated you will be to maintain the\nhabits associated with it. If you’re proud of how your hair\nlooks, you’ll develop all sorts of habits to care for and\nmaintain it. If you’re proud of the size of your biceps, you’ll\nmake sure you never skip an upper-body workout. If you’re\nproud of the scarves you knit, you’ll be more likely to spend\nhours knitting each week. Once your pride gets involved,\nyou’ll ﬁght tooth and nail to maintain your habits.\nTrue behavior change is identity change. Y ou might start\na habit because of motivation, but the only reason you’ll\nstick with one is that it becomes part of your identity .\nAnyone can convince themselves to visit the gym or eat\nhealthy once or twice, but if you don’t shift the belief\nbehind the behavior , then it is hard to stick with long-term\nchanges. Improvements are only temporary until they\nbecome part of who you are.\nThe goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become  a\nreader .\nThe goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to\nbecome  a runner .\nThe goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to\nbecome  a musician.\nYour behaviors are usually a reﬂection of your identity .\nWhat you do is an indication of the type of person you\nbelieve that you are—either consciously or nonconsciously .*\nResearch has shown that once a person believes in a\nparticular aspect of their identity , they are more likely to\nact in alignment with that belief . For example, people who\nidentiﬁed as “being a voter” were more likely to vote than\nthose who simply claimed “voting” was an action they\nwanted to perform. Similarly , the person who incorporates\nexercise into their identity doesn’t have to convince",

    "text": " actions are a system of beliefs.\nThe system of a democracy is founded on beliefs like\nfreedom, majority rule, and social equality . The system of a\ndictatorship has a very diﬀerent set of beliefs like absolute\nauthority and strict obedience. Y ou can imagine many ways\nto try to get more people to vote in a democracy , but such\nbehavior change would never get oﬀ the ground in a\ndictatorship. That’s not the identity of the system. V oting is\na behavior that is impossible under a certain set of beliefs.\nA similar pattern exists whether we are discussing\nindividuals, organizations, or societies. There are a set of\nbeliefs and assumptions that shape the system, an identity\nbehind the habits.\nBehavior that is incongruent with the self will not last.\nYou may want more money , but if your identity is someone\nwho consumes rather than creates, then you’ll continue to\nbe pulled toward spending rather than earning. Y ou may\nwant better health, but if you continue to prioritize comfort\nover accomplishment, you’ll be drawn to relaxing rather\nthan training. It’s hard to change your habits if you never\nchange the underlying beliefs that led to your past\nbehavior . You have a new goal and a new plan, but you\nhaven’t changed who you are.\nThe story of Brian Clark, an entrepreneur from Boulder ,\nColorado, provides a good example. “F or as long as I can\nremember , I’ve chewed my ﬁngernails,” Clark told me. “It\nstarted as a nervous habit when I was young, and then\nmorphed into an undesirable grooming ritual. One day , I\nresolved to stop chewing my nails until they grew out a bit.\nThrough mindful willpower alone, I managed to do it.”\nThen, Clark did something surprising.\n“I asked my wife to schedule my ﬁrst-ever manicure,” he\nsaid. “My thought was that if I started paying to maintain\nmy nails, I wouldn’t chew them. And it worked, but not for\nthe monetary reason. What happened was the manicure\nmade my ﬁngers look really nice for the ﬁrst time. The\nmanicurist even said that—other than the chewing—I had\nreally healthy , attractive nails. Suddenly , I was proud of my\nﬁngernails. And even though that’s something I had never\naspired to, it",

The system of a\ndictatorship has a very diﬀerent set of beliefs like absolute\nauthority and strict obedience. Y ou can imagine many ways\nto try to get more people to vote in a democracy , but such\nbehavior change would never get oﬀ the ground in a\ndictatorship. That’s not the identity of the system. V oting is\na behavior that is impossible under a certain set of beliefs.\nA similar pattern exists whether we are discussing\nindividuals, organizations, or societies. There are a set of\nbeliefs and assumptions that shape the system, an identity\nbehind the habits.\nBehavior that is incongruent with the self will not last.\nYou may want more money , but if your identity is someone\nwho consumes rather than creates, then you’ll continue to\nbe pulled toward spending rather than earning. Y ou may\nwant better health, but if you continue to prioritize comfort\nover accomplishment, you’ll be drawn to relaxing rather\nthan training. It’s hard to change your habits if you never\nchange the underlying beliefs that led to",

And even though that’s something I had never\naspired to, it made all the diﬀerence. I’ve never chewed my\nnails since; not even a single close call. And it’s because I\nnow take pride in properly caring for them.”\nThe ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit\nbecomes part of your identity . It’s one thing to say I’m the\ntype of person who wants  this. It’s something very diﬀerent\nto say I’m the type of person who is this.\nThe more pride you have in a particular aspect of your\nidentity , the more motivated you will be to maintain the\nhabits associated with it.

Improvements are only temporary until they\nbecome part of who you are.\nThe goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become  a\nreader .\nThe goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to\nbecome  a runner .\nThe goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to\nbecome  a musician.\nYour behaviors are usually a reﬂection of your identity .\nWhat you do is an indication of the type of person you\nbelieve that you are—either consciously or nonconsciously .*\nResearch has shown that once a person believes in a\nparticular aspect of their identity , they are more likely to\nact in alignment with that belief .

    "text": "manicurist even said that—other than the chewing—I had\nreally healthy , attractive nails. Suddenly , I was proud of my\nﬁngernails. And even though that’s something I had never\naspired to, it made all the diﬀerence. I’ve never chewed my\nnails since; not even a single close call. And it’s because I\nnow take pride in properly caring for them.”\nThe ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit\nbecomes part of your identity . It’s one thing to say I’m the\ntype of person who wants  this. It’s something very diﬀerent\nto say I’m the type of person who is this.\nThe more pride you have in a particular aspect of your\nidentity , the more motivated you will be to maintain the\nhabits associated with it. If you’re proud of how your hair\nlooks, you’ll develop all sorts of habits to care for and\nmaintain it. If you’re proud of the size of your biceps, you’ll\nmake sure you never skip an upper-body workout. If you’re\nproud of the scarves you knit, you’ll be more likely to spend\nhours",

If you’re\nproud of the scarves you knit, you’ll be more likely to spend\nhours knitting each week. Once your pride gets involved,\nyou’ll ﬁght tooth and nail to maintain your habits.\nTrue behavior change is identity change. Y ou might start\na habit because of motivation, but the only reason you’ll\nstick with one is that it becomes part of your identity .\nAnyone can convince themselves to visit the gym or eat\nhealthy once or twice, but if you don’t shift the belief\nbehind the behavior , then it is hard to stick with long-term\nchanges. Improvements are only temporary until they\nbecome part of who you are.\nThe goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become  a\nreader .\nThe goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to\nbecome  a runner .\nThe goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to\nbecome  a musician.\nYour behaviors are usually a reﬂection of your identity .\nWhat you do is an indication of the type of person you\nbelieve",

    "text": "iﬁed as “being a voter” were more likely to vote than\nthose who simply claimed “voting” was an action they\nwanted to perform. Similarly , the person who incorporates\nexercise into their identity doesn’t have to convince\nthemselves to train. Doing the right thing is easy . After all,\nwhen your behavior and your identity are fully aligned, you\nare no longer pursuing behavior change. Y ou are simply\nacting like the type of person you already believe yourself\nto be.\nLike all aspects of habit formation, this, too, is a double-\nedged sword. When working for you, identity change can\nbe a powerful force for self -improvement. When working\nagainst you, though, identity change can be a curse. Once\nyou have adopted an identity , it can be easy to let your\nallegiance to it impact your ability to change. Many people\nwalk through life in a cognitive slumber , blindly following\nthe norms attached to their identity .\n“I’m terrible with directions.”\n“I’m not a morning person.”\n“I’m bad at remembering people’s names.”\n“I’m always late.”\n“I’m not good with technology .”\n“I’m horrible at math.”\n. . . and a thousand other variations.\nWhen you have repeated a story to yourself for years, it\nis easy to slide into these mental grooves and accept them\nas a fact. In time, you begin to resist certain actions\nbecause “that’s not who I am.” There is internal pressure to\nmaintain your self -image and behave in a way that is\nconsistent with your beliefs. Y ou ﬁnd whatever way you can\nto avoid contradicting yourself .\nThe more deeply a thought or action is tied to your\nidentity , the more diﬀicult it is to change it. It can feel\ncomfortable to believe what your culture believes (group\nidentity) or to do what upholds your self -image (personal\nidentity), even if it’s wrong. The biggest barrier to positive\nchange at any level—individual, team, society—is identity\nconﬂict. Good habits can make rational sense, but if they\nconﬂict with your identity , you will fail to put them into\naction.\nOn any given day , you may struggle with your habits\nbecause you’re too busy or too tired or too overwhelmed or\nhundreds of other reasons. Over the long run, however , the\nreal reason you fail to stick with habits is that your self -\nimage gets in the way . This is why you can’t get too\nattached to one version of your identity . Progress requires\nunlearning. Becoming the best version of yourself requires\nyou to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and\nexpand your identity .\nThis brings us to an important question: If your beliefs\nand worldview play such an important role in your\nbehavior , where do they come from in the ﬁrst place? How ,\nexactly , is your identity formed? And how can you\nemphasize new aspects of your identity that serve you and\ngradually erase the pieces that hinder you?\nTHE TWO -STEP PROCES S TO CHANGING Y OUR\nIDENTITY\nYour identity emerges out of your habits. Y ou are not born\nwith preset beliefs. Every belief , including those about\nyourself , is learned and conditioned through experience. *\nMore precisely , your habits are how you embody  your\nidentity . When you make your bed each day , you embody\nthe identity of an organized person. When you write each\nday, you embody the identity of a creative person. When\nyou train each day , you embody the identity of an athletic\nperson.\nThe more you repeat a behavior , the more you reinforce\nthe identity associated with that behavior . In fact, the word\nidentity  was originally derived from the Latin words\nessentitas , which means being,  and identidem , which\nmeans repeatedly . Your identity is literally your “repeated\nbeingness.”\nWhatever your identity is right now , you only believe it\nbecause you have proof of it. If you go to church every\nSunday for twenty years, you have evidence that you are\nreligious. If you study biology for one hour every night, you\nhave evidence that you are studious. If you go to the gym\neven when it’s snowing, you have evidence that you are\ncommitted to ﬁtness. The more evidence you have for a\nbelief , the more strongly you will believe it.\nFor most of my early life, I didn’t consider myself a\nwriter . If you were to ask any of my high school teachers or\ncollege professors, they would tell you I was an average\nwriter at best: certainly not a standout. When I began my\nwriting career , I published a new article every Monday and\nThursday for the ﬁrst few years. As the evidence grew , so\ndid my identity",

    "text": "iﬁed as “being a voter” were more likely to vote than\nthose who simply claimed “voting” was an action they\nwanted to perform. Similarly , the person who incorporates\nexercise into their identity doesn’t have to convince\nthemselves to train. Doing the right thing is easy . After all,\nwhen your behavior and your identity are fully aligned, you\nare no longer pursuing behavior change. Y ou are simply\nacting like the type of person you already believe yourself\nto be.\nLike all aspects of habit formation, this, too, is a double-\nedged sword. When working for you, identity change can\nbe a powerful force for self -improvement. When working\nagainst you, though, identity change can be a curse. Once\nyou have adopted an identity , it can be easy to let your\nallegiance to it impact your ability to change. Many people\nwalk through life in a cognitive slumber , blindly following\nthe norms attached to their identity .\n“I’m terrible with directions.”\n“I’m not a morning person.”\n“I’m bad at remembering people’s names.”\n“I’m always late.”\n“I’m not good with technology .”\n“I’m horrible at math.”\n. . . and a thousand other variations.\nWhen you have repeated a story to yourself for years, it\nis easy to slide into these mental grooves and accept them\nas a fact. In time, you begin to resist certain actions\nbecause “that’s not who I am.” There is internal pressure to\nmaintain your self -image and behave in a way that is\nconsistent with your beliefs. Y ou ﬁnd whatever way you can\nto avoid contradicting yourself .\nThe more deeply a thought or action is tied to your\nidentity , the more diﬀicult it is to change it. It can feel\ncomfortable to believe what your culture believes (group\nidentity) or to do what upholds your self -image (personal\nidentity), even if it’s wrong. The biggest barrier to positive\nchange at any level—individual, team, society—is identity\nconﬂict. Good habits can make rational sense, but if they\nconﬂict with your identity , you will fail to put them into\naction.\nOn any given day , you may struggle with your habits\nbecause you’re too busy or too tired or too overwhelmed or\nhundreds of other reasons. Over the long run, however , the\nreal reason you fail",

    "text": " put them into\naction.\nOn any given day , you may struggle with your habits\nbecause you’re too busy or too tired or too overwhelmed or\nhundreds of other reasons. Over the long run, however , the\nreal reason you fail to stick with habits is that your self -\nimage gets in the way . This is why you can’t get too\nattached to one version of your identity . Progress requires\nunlearning. Becoming the best version of yourself requires\nyou to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and\nexpand your identity .\nThis brings us to an important question: If your beliefs\nand worldview play such an important role in your\nbehavior , where do they come from in the ﬁrst place? How ,\nexactly , is your identity formed? And how can you\nemphasize new aspects of your identity that serve you and\ngradually erase the pieces that hinder you?\nTHE TWO -STEP PROCES S TO CHANGING Y OUR\nIDENTITY\nYour identity emerges out of your habits. Y ou are not born\nwith preset beliefs. Every belief , including those about\nyourself , is learned and conditioned through experience. *\nMore precisely , your habits are how you embody  your\nidentity . When you make your bed each day , you embody\nthe identity of an organized person. When you write each\nday, you embody the identity of a creative person. When\nyou train each day , you embody the identity of an athletic\nperson.\nThe more you repeat a behavior , the more you reinforce\nthe identity associated with that behavior . In fact, the word\nidentity  was originally derived from the Latin words\nessentitas , which means being,  and identidem , which\nmeans repeatedly . Your identity is literally your “repeated\nbeingness.”\nWhatever your identity is right now , you only believe it\nbecause you have proof of it. If you go to church every\nSunday for twenty years, you have evidence that you are\nreligious. If you study biology for one hour every night, you\nhave evidence that you are studious. If you go to the gym\neven when it’s snowing, you have evidence that you are\ncommitted to ﬁtness. The more evidence you have for a\nbelief , the more strongly you will believe it.\nFor most of my early life, I didn’t consider myself a\nwriter . If you were to ask any of my high school teachers or\ncollege professors, they would tell you",

    "text": " I was an average\nwriter at best: certainly not a standout. When I began my\nwriting career , I published a new article every Monday and\nThursday for the ﬁrst few years. As the evidence grew , so\ndid my identity as a writer . I didn’t start out as a writer . I\nbecame  one through my habits.\nOf course, your habits are not the only actions that\ninﬂuence your identity , but by virtue of their frequency they\nare usually the most important ones. Each experience in\nlife modiﬁes your self -image, but it’s unlikely you would\nconsider yourself a soccer player because you kicked a ball\nonce or an artist because you scribbled a picture. As you\nrepeat these actions, however , the evidence accumulates\nand your self -image begins to change. The eﬀect of one-oﬀ\nexperiences tends to fade away while the eﬀect of habits\ngets reinforced with time, which means your habits\ncontribute most of the evidence that shapes your identity .\nIn this way , the process of building habits is actually the\nprocess of becoming yourself .\nThis is a gradual evolution. W e do not change by\nsnapping our ﬁngers and deciding to be someone entirely\nnew. We change bit by bit, day by day , habit by habit. W e\nare continually undergoing microevolutions of the self .\nEach habit is like a suggestion: “Hey , maybe this is who I\nam.” If you ﬁnish a book, then perhaps you are the type of\nperson who likes reading. If you go to the gym, then\nperhaps you are the type of person who likes exercise. If\nyou practice playing the guitar , perhaps you are the type of\nperson who likes music.\nEvery action you take is a vote for the type of person you\nwish to become. No single instance will transform your\nbeliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of\nyour new identity . This is one reason why meaningful\nchange does not require radical change. Small habits can\nmake a meaningful diﬀerence by providing evidence of a\nnew identity . And if a change is meaningful, it actually is\nbig. That’s the paradox of making small improvements.\nPutting this all together , you can see that habits are the\npath to changing your identity . The most practical way to\nchange who you are is to change what  you do .\nEach time you write a page, you are a writer .\nEach time you practice the violin, you are a musician.\nEach time you start a workout, you are an athlete.\nEach time you encourage your employees, you are a\nleader .\nEach habit not only gets results but also teaches you\nsomething far more important: to trust yourself . You start\nto believe you can actually accomplish these things. When\nthe votes mount up and the evidence begins to change, the\nstory you tell yourself begins to change as well.\nOf course, it works the opposite way , too. Every time you\nchoose to perform a bad habit, it’s a vote for that identity .\nThe good news is that you don’t need to be perfect. In any\nelection, there are going to be votes for both sides. Y ou\ndon’t need a unanimous vote to win an election; you just\nneed a majority . It doesn’t matter if you cast a few votes for\na bad behavior or an unproductive habit. Y our goal is\nsimply to win the majority of the time.\nNew identities require new evidence. If you keep casting\nthe same votes you’ve always cast, you’re going to get the\nsame results you’ve always had. If nothing changes,\nnothing is going to change.\nIt is a simple two-step process:\n1. Decide the type of person you want to be.\n2. Prove it to yourself with small wins.\nFirst, decide who you want to be. This holds at any level\n—as an individual, as a team, as a community , as a nation.\nWhat do you want to stand for? What are your principles\nand values? Who do you wish to become?\nThese are big questions, and many people aren’t sure\nwhere to begin—but they do know what kind of results they\nwant: to get six -pack abs or to feel less anxious or to double\ntheir salary . That’s ﬁne. Start there and work backward\nfrom the results you want to the type of person who could\nget those results. Ask yourself , “Who is the type of person\nthat could get the outcome I want?” Who is the type of\nperson that could lose forty pounds? Who is the type of\nperson that could learn a new language? Who is the type of\nperson that could run a successful start-up?\nFor example, “ Who is the type of person who could write\na book?” It’s probably",

    "text": " I was an average\nwriter at best: certainly not a standout. When I began my\nwriting career , I published a new article every Monday and\nThursday for the ﬁrst few years. As the evidence grew , so\ndid my identity as a writer . I didn’t start out as a writer . I\nbecame  one through my habits.\nOf course, your habits are not the only actions that\ninﬂuence your identity , but by virtue of their frequency they\nare usually the most important ones. Each experience in\nlife modiﬁes your self -image, but it’s unlikely you would\nconsider yourself a soccer player because you kicked a ball\nonce or an artist because you scribbled a picture. As you\nrepeat these actions, however , the evidence accumulates\nand your self -image begins to change. The eﬀect of one-oﬀ\nexperiences tends to fade away while the eﬀect of habits\ngets reinforced with time, which means your habits\ncontribute most of the evidence that shapes your identity .\nIn this way , the process of building habits is actually the\nprocess of becoming yourself .\nThis is a gradual evolution. W e do not change by\nsnapping our ﬁngers and deciding to be someone entirely\nnew. We change bit by bit, day by day , habit by habit. W e\nare continually undergoing microevolutions of the self .\nEach habit is like a suggestion: “Hey , maybe this is who I\nam.” If you ﬁnish a book, then perhaps you are the type of\nperson who likes reading. If you go to the gym, then\nperhaps you are the type of person who likes exercise. If\nyou practice playing the guitar , perhaps you are the type of\nperson who likes music.\nEvery action you take is a vote for the type of person you\nwish to become. No single instance will transform your\nbeliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of\nyour new identity . This is one reason why meaningful\nchange does not require radical change. Small habits can\nmake a meaningful diﬀerence by providing evidence of a\nnew identity . And if a change is meaningful, it actually is\nbig. That’s the paradox of making small improvements.\nPutting this all together , you can see that habits are the\npath to changing your identity . The most practical way to\nchange who you are",

As the evidence grew , so\ndid my identity as a writer . I didn’t start out as a writer . I\nbecame  one through my habits.\nOf course, your habits are not the only actions that\ninﬂuence your identity , but by virtue of their frequency they\nare usually the most important ones. Each experience in\nlife modiﬁes your self -image, but it’s unlikely you would\nconsider yourself a soccer player because you kicked a ball\nonce or an artist because you scribbled a picture. As you\nrepeat these actions, however , the evidence accumulates\nand your self -image begins to change. The eﬀect of one-oﬀ\nexperiences tends to fade away while the eﬀect of habits\ngets reinforced with time, which means your habits\ncontribute most of the evidence that shapes your identity .\nIn this way , the process of building habits is actually the\nprocess of becoming yourself .\nThis is a gradual evolution.

If\nyou practice playing the guitar , perhaps you are the type of\nperson who likes music.\nEvery action you take is a vote for the type of person you\nwish to become. No single instance will transform your\nbeliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of\nyour new identity . This is one reason why meaningful\nchange does not require radical change. Small habits can\nmake a meaningful diﬀerence by providing evidence of a\nnew identity . And",

    "text": " if a change is meaningful, it actually is\nbig. That’s the paradox of making small improvements.\nPutting this all together , you can see that habits are the\npath to changing your identity . The most practical way to\nchange who you are is to change what  you do .\nEach time you write a page, you are a writer .\nEach time you practice the violin, you are a musician.\nEach time you start a workout, you are an athlete.\nEach time you encourage your employees, you are a\nleader .\nEach habit not only gets results but also teaches you\nsomething far more important: to trust yourself . You start\nto believe you can actually accomplish these things. When\nthe votes mount up and the evidence begins to change, the\nstory you tell yourself begins to change as well.\nOf course, it works the opposite way , too. Every time you\nchoose to perform a bad habit, it’s a vote for that identity .\nThe good news is that you don’t need to be perfect. In any\nelection, there are going to be votes for both sides. Y ou\ndon’t need a unanimous vote to win an election; you just\nneed a majority . It doesn’t matter if you cast a few votes for\na bad behavior or an unproductive habit. Y our goal is\nsimply to win the majority of the time.\nNew identities require new evidence. If you keep casting\nthe same votes you’ve always cast, you’re going to get the\nsame results you’ve always had. If nothing changes,\nnothing is going to change.\nIt is a simple two-step process:\n1. Decide the type of person you want to be.\n2. Prove it to yourself with small wins.\nFirst, decide who you want to be. This holds at any level\n—as an individual, as a team, as a community , as a nation.\nWhat do you want to stand for? What are your principles\nand values? Who do you wish to become?\nThese are big questions, and many people aren’t sure\nwhere to begin—but they do know what kind of results they\nwant: to get six -pack abs or to feel less anxious or to double\ntheir salary . That’s ﬁne. Start there and work backward\nfrom the results you want to the type of person who could\nget those results. Ask yourself , “Who is the type of person\nthat could get the outcome I want?” Who is the type of\nperson that could lose forty pounds",

That’s the paradox of making small improvements.\nPutting this all together , you can see that habits are the\npath to changing your identity . The most practical way to\nchange who you are is to change what  you do .\nEach time you write a page, you are a writer .\nEach time you practice the violin, you are a musician.\nEach time you start a workout, you are an athlete.\nEach time you encourage your employees, you are a\nleader .\nEach habit not only gets results but also teaches you\nsomething far more important: to trust yourself .

When\nthe votes mount up and the evidence begins to change, the\nstory you tell yourself begins to change as well.\nOf course, it works the opposite way , too. Every time you\nchoose to perform a bad habit, it’s a vote for that identity .\nThe good news is that you don’t need to be perfect. In any\nelection, there are going to be votes for both sides. Y ou\ndon’t need a unanimous vote to win an election; you just\nneed a majority . It doesn’t matter if you cast a few votes for\na",

It doesn’t matter if you cast a few votes for\na bad behavior or an unproductive habit. Y our goal is\nsimply to win the majority of the time.\nNew identities require new evidence. If you keep casting\nthe same votes you’ve always cast, you’re going to get the\nsame results you’ve always had. If nothing changes,\nnothing is going to change.\nIt is a simple two-step process:\n1. Decide the type of person you want to be.\n2. Prove it to yourself with small wins.\nFirst, decide who you want to be. This holds at any level\n—as an individual, as a team, as a community , as a nation.\nWhat do you want to stand for? What are your principles\nand values? Who do you wish to become?\nThese are big questions, and many people aren’t sure\nwhere to begin—but they do know what kind of results they\nwant: to get six -pack abs or to feel less anxious or to double\ntheir salary . That’s ﬁne. Start there and work",

    "text": "? Who is the type of\nperson that could learn a new language? Who is the type of\nperson that could run a successful start-up?\nFor example, “ Who is the type of person who could write\na book?” It’s probably someone who is consistent and\nreliable. Now your focus shifts from writing a book\n(outcome-based) to being the type of person who is\nconsistent and reliable (identity-based).\nThis process can lead to beliefs like:\n“I’m the kind of teacher who stands up for her\nstudents.”\n“I’m the kind of doctor who gives each patient the time\nand empathy they need.”\n“I’m the kind of manager who advocates for her\nemployees.”\nOnce you have a handle on the type of person you want\nto be, you can begin taking small steps to reinforce your\ndesired identity . I have a friend who lost over 100 pounds\nby asking herself , “What would a healthy person do?” All\nday long, she would use this question as a guide. W ould a\nhealthy person walk or take a cab? W ould a healthy person\norder a burrito or a salad? She ﬁgured if she acted like a\nhealthy person long enough, eventually she would become\nthat person. She was right.\nThe concept of identity-based habits is our ﬁrst\nintroduction to another key theme in this book: feedback\nloops. Y our habits shape your identity , and your identity\nshapes your habits. It’s a two-way street. The formation of\nall habits is a feedback loop (a concept we will explore in\ndepth in the next chapter), but it’s important to let your\nvalues, principles, and identity drive the loop rather than\nyour results. The focus should always be on becoming that\ntype of person, not getting a particular outcome.\nTHE REAL REASON HABITS MA TTER\nIdentity change is the North Star of habit change. The\nremainder of this book will provide you with step-by-step\ninstructions on how to build better habits in yourself , your\nfamily , your team, your company , and anywhere else you\nwish. But the true question is: “ Are you becoming the type\nof person you want to become?” The ﬁrst step is not what\nor how, but who. You need to know who you want to be.\nOtherwise, your quest for change is like a boat without a\nrudder . And that’s why we are starting here.\nYou have the power to change your beliefs about\nyourself . Your identity is not set in stone. Y ou have a choice\nin every moment. Y ou can choose the identity you want to\nreinforce today with the habits you choose today . And this\nbrings us to the deeper purpose of this book and the real\nreason habits matter .\nBuilding better habits isn’t about littering your day with\nlife hacks. It’s not about ﬂossing one tooth each night or\ntaking a cold shower each morning or wearing the same\noutﬁt each day . It’s not about achieving external measures\nof success like earning more money , losing weight, or\nreducing stress. Habits can help you achieve all of these\nthings, but fundamentally they are not about having\nsomething. They are about becoming  someone.\nUltimately , your habits matter because they help you\nbecome the type of person you wish to be. They are the\nchannel through which you develop your deepest beliefs\nabout yourself . Quite literally , you become your habits.\nChapter Summary\nThere are three levels of change: outcome change,\nprocess change, and identity change.\nThe most eﬀective way to change your habits is to\nfocus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you\nwish to become.\nYour identity emerges out of your habits. Every action\nis a vote for the type of person you wish to become.\nBecoming the best version of yourself requires you to\ncontinuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and\nexpand your identity .\nThe real reason habits matter is not because they can\nget you better results (although they can do that), but\nbecause they can change your beliefs about yourself .",

    "text": "? Who is the type of\nperson that could learn a new language? Who is the type of\nperson that could run a successful start-up?\nFor example, “ Who is the type of person who could write\na book?” It’s probably someone who is consistent and\nreliable. Now your focus shifts from writing a book\n(outcome-based) to being the type of person who is\nconsistent and reliable (identity-based).\nThis process can lead to beliefs like:\n“I’m the kind of teacher who stands up for her\nstudents.”\n“I’m the kind of doctor who gives each patient the time\nand empathy they need.”\n“I’m the kind of manager who advocates for her\nemployees.”\nOnce you have a handle on the type of person you want\nto be, you can begin taking small steps to reinforce your\ndesired identity . I have a friend who lost over 100 pounds\nby asking herself , “What would a healthy person do?” All\nday long, she would use this question as a guide. W ould a\nhealthy person walk or take a cab? W ould a healthy person\norder a burrito or a salad? She ﬁgured if she acted like a\nhealthy person long enough, eventually she would become\nthat person. She was right.\nThe concept of identity-based habits is our ﬁrst\nintroduction to another key theme in this book: feedback\nloops. Y our habits shape your identity , and your identity\nshapes your habits. It’s a two-way street. The formation of\nall habits is a feedback loop (a concept we will explore in\ndepth in the next chapter), but it’s important to let your\nvalues, principles, and identity drive the loop rather than\nyour results. The focus should always be on becoming that\ntype of person, not getting a particular outcome.\nTHE REAL REASON HABITS MA TTER\nIdentity change is the North Star of habit change. The\nremainder of this book will provide you with step-by-step\ninstructions on how to build better habits in yourself , your\nfamily , your team, your company , and anywhere else you\nwish. But the true question is: “ Are you becoming the type\nof person you want to become?” The ﬁrst step is not what\nor how, but who. You need to know who you want to be.\nOtherwise, your quest for change is like a boat without a\nrudder . And that’s why we are starting here.\nYou have",

    "text": "rst step is not what\nor how, but who. You need to know who you want to be.\nOtherwise, your quest for change is like a boat without a\nrudder . And that’s why we are starting here.\nYou have the power to change your beliefs about\nyourself . Your identity is not set in stone. Y ou have a choice\nin every moment. Y ou can choose the identity you want to\nreinforce today with the habits you choose today . And this\nbrings us to the deeper purpose of this book and the real\nreason habits matter .\nBuilding better habits isn’t about littering your day with\nlife hacks. It’s not about ﬂossing one tooth each night or\ntaking a cold shower each morning or wearing the same\noutﬁt each day . It’s not about achieving external measures\nof success like earning more money , losing weight, or\nreducing stress. Habits can help you achieve all of these\nthings, but fundamentally they are not about having\nsomething. They are about becoming  someone.\nUltimately , your habits matter because they help you\nbecome the type of person you wish to be. They are the\nchannel through which you develop your deepest beliefs\nabout yourself . Quite literally , you become your habits.\nChapter Summary\nThere are three levels of change: outcome change,\nprocess change, and identity change.\nThe most eﬀective way to change your habits is to\nfocus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you\nwish to become.\nYour identity emerges out of your habits. Every action\nis a vote for the type of person you wish to become.\nBecoming the best version of yourself requires you to\ncontinuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and\nexpand your identity .\nThe real reason habits matter is not because they can\nget you better results (although they can do that), but\nbecause they can change your beliefs about yourself .",

    "text": "rst step is not what\nor how, but who. You need to know who you want to be.\nOtherwise, your quest for change is like a boat without a\nrudder . And that’s why we are starting here.\nYou have the power to change your beliefs about\nyourself . Your identity is not set in stone. Y ou have a choice\nin every moment. Y ou can choose the identity you want to\nreinforce today with the habits you choose today . And this\nbrings us to the deeper purpose of this book and the real\nreason habits matter .\nBuilding better habits isn’t about littering your day with\nlife hacks. It’s not about ﬂossing one tooth each night or\ntaking a cold shower each morning or wearing the same\noutﬁt each day . It’s not about achieving external measures\nof success like earning more money , losing weight, or\nreducing stress. Habits can help you achieve all of these\nthings, but fundamentally they are not about having\nsomething. They are about becoming  someone.\nUltimately , your habits matter because they help you\nbecome the type of person you wish to be. They are the\nchannel through which you develop your deepest beliefs",

    "text": " but fundamentally they are not about having\nsomething. They are about becoming  someone.\nUltimately , your habits matter because they help you\nbecome the type of person you wish to be. They are the\nchannel through which you develop your deepest beliefs\nabout yourself . Quite literally , you become your habits.\nChapter Summary\nThere are three levels of change: outcome change,\nprocess change, and identity change.\nThe most eﬀective way to change your habits is to\nfocus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you\nwish to become.\nYour identity emerges out of your habits. Every action\nis a vote for the type of person you wish to become.\nBecoming the best version of yourself requires you to\ncontinuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and\nexpand your identity .\nThe real reason habits matter is not because they can\nget you better results (although they can do that), but\nbecause they can change your beliefs about yourself .",
