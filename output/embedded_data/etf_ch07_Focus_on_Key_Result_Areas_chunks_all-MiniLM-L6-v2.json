This is one of the most important\nquestions you ever ask and answer, over and over again, throughoutyour career.\nAs it happens, most people are not sure exactly why they are on the\npayroll. But if you are not crystal clear about why it is that you are on\nthe payroll and what results you have been hired to accomplish, it is\nvery hard for you to perform at your best, get paid more and\npromoted faster.\nIn its simplest terms, you have been hired to get specific results . A\nwage or a salary is a payment for a specific quality and quantity of\nwork that can be combined with the work of others to create a\nproduct or service that customers are willing to pay for.\nEach job can be broken down into about five to seven key result\nareas, seldom more. These are the results that you absolutely,\npositively have to get to fulfill your responsibilities and make your\nmaximum contribution to your organization.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 50Key result areas are similar to the vital functions of the body, such as\nblood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and brainwave activity.\nAn absence of any one of these vital functions leads to the death of\nthe organism. By the same token, your failure to perform in a criticalresult area of your work can lead to the end of your job as well.\nThe Big Seven in Management and Sales\nFor example, the key result areas of management are: Planning,\nOrganizing, Staffing, Delegating, Supervising, Measuring and\nReporting. These are the results that a manager must get to succeed\nin his or her area of responsibility. A weakness in any one of theseareas can lead to underachievement and failure as a manager.\nThe key result areas of salespeople are: Prospecting, Building\nRapport and Trust, Identifying Needs, Presenting Persuasively,Answering Objections, Closing the Sale, and Getting Resales and\nReferrals. Poor performance in any one of these key skills leads to\nlower sales and sometimes failure as a salesperson.\nWhatever you do, there are essential skills that you must have for\nyou to do your job in an excellent fashion. These demands are\nconstantly changing. There are core competencies that you have\ndeveloped that make it possible for you to do your job in the first\nplace. But there are always key results that are central to your work\nand which determine your success or failure in your job. What are\nyours?\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 51A key result area is defined as something for which you are\ncompletely responsible. This means that if you don't do it, it doesn't\nget done. A key result area is an activity that is under your control. It\nis an output of your work that becomes an input or a contributingfactor to the work of others.\nClarity Is Essential\nThe starting point of high performance is for you to first of all\nidentify the key result areas of your work. Discuss them with your\nboss. Make a list of your most important output responsibilities and\nmake sure that the people above you, next to you and below you arein agreement with it.\nFor example, for a salesperson, opening new accounts is a key result\narea. This activity is the key to the entire sales process. Closing a saleis a key result area. When the sale is made, it triggers the activities of\nmany other people to produce and deliver the product or service.\nFor a company owner or key executive, negotiating a bank loan is a\nkey result area. Hiring the right people and delegating effectively are\nboth key result areas. For a receptionist or secretary, typing a letter or\nanswering the phone and transferring the caller quickly and\nefficiently are defined as key result areas. The employee’s ability to\nperform these tasks quickly and efficiently largely determines her\npay and promotability.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 52Give Yourself a Grade\nOnce you have determined your key result areas, the second step is\nfor you to grade yourself on a scale of 1-10 in each of those areas.Where are you strong and where are you weak? Where are yougetting excellent results and where are you underperforming?\nRule: Your weakest key result area sets the height at which you can\nuse all your other skills and abilities.\nThis rule says that you could be exceptional in six out of seven key\nresult areas but really poor in the seventh. And your poorperformance in the seventh area will hold you back and determine\nhow much you achieve with all your other skills. This weakness will\nact as a drag on your effectiveness and be",

This is one of the most important\nquestions you ever ask and answer, over and over again, throughoutyour career.\nAs it happens, most people are not sure exactly why they are on the\npayroll. But if you are not crystal clear about why it is that you are on\nthe payroll and what results you have been hired to accomplish, it is\nvery hard for you to perform at your best, get paid more and\npromoted faster.\nIn its simplest terms, you have been hired to get specific results . A\nwage or a salary is a payment for a specific quality and quantity of\nwork that can be combined with the work of others to create a\nproduct or service that customers are willing to pay for.\nEach job can be broken down into about five to seven key result\nareas, seldom more. These are the results that you absolutely,\npositively have to get to fulfill your responsibilities and make your\nmaximum contribution to your organization.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 50Key result areas are similar to the vital functions of the body, such as\nblood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and brainwave activity.\nAn absence of any one of these vital functions leads to the death of\nthe organism. By the same token, your failure to perform in a criticalresult area of your work can lead to the end of your job as well.\nThe Big Seven in Management and Sales\nFor example, the key result areas of management are: Planning,\nOrganizing, Staffing, Delegating, Supervising, Measuring and\nReporting. These are the results that a manager must get to succeed\nin his or her area of responsibility. A weakness in any one of theseareas can lead to underachievement and failure as a manager.\nThe key result areas of salespeople are: Prospecting, Building\nRapport and Trust, Identifying Needs, Presenting Persuasively,Answering Objections, Closing the Sale, and Getting Resales and\nReferrals. Poor performance in any one of these key skills leads to\nlower sales and sometimes failure as a salesperson.\nWhatever you do, there are essential skills that you must have for\nyou to do your job in an excellent fashion. These demands are\n",

This is one of the most important\nquestions you ever ask and answer, over and over again, throughoutyour career.\nAs it happens, most people are not sure exactly why they are on the\npayroll. But if you are not crystal clear about why it is that you are on\nthe payroll and what results you have been hired to accomplish, it is\nvery hard for you to perform at your best, get paid more and\npromoted faster.\nIn its simplest terms, you have been hired to get specific results . A\nwage or a salary is a payment for a specific quality and quantity of\nwork that can be combined with the work of others to create a\nproduct or service that customers are willing to pay for.\nEach job can be broken down into about five to seven key result\nareas, seldom more. These are the results that you absolutely,\npositively have to get to fulfill your responsibilities and make your\nmaximum contribution to your organization.\nEAT THAT FROG!\n",

These demands are\nconstantly changing. There are core competencies that you have\ndeveloped that make it possible for you to do your job in the first\nplace. But there are always key results that are central to your work\nand which determine your success or failure in your job. What are\nyours?\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 51A key result area is defined as something for which you are\ncompletely responsible. This means that if you don't do it, it doesn't\nget done. A key result area is an activity that is under your control. It\nis an output of your work that becomes an input or a contributingfactor to the work of others.\nClarity Is Essential\nThe starting point of high performance is for you to first of all\nidentify the key result areas of your work. Discuss them with your\nboss. Make a list of your most important output responsibilities and\nmake sure that the people above you, next to you and below you arein agreement with it.\nFor example, for a salesperson, opening new accounts is a key result\narea. This activity is the key to the entire sales process. Closing a saleis a key result area. When the sale is made, it triggers the activities of\nmany other people to produce and deliver the product or service.\nFor a company owner or key executive, negotiating a bank loan is a\nkey result area. Hiring the right people and delegating effectively are\nboth key result areas. For a receptionist or secretary, typing a letter or\nanswering the phone and transferring the caller quickly and\nefficiently are defined as key result areas. The employee’s ability to\nperform these tasks quickly and efficiently largely determines her\npay and promotability.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 52Give Yourself a Grade\nOnce you have determined your key result areas, the second step is\nfor you to grade yourself on a scale of 1-10 in each of those areas.Where are you strong and where are you weak? Where are yougetting excellent results and where are you underperforming?\nRule: Your weakest key result area sets the height at which you can\nuse all your other skills and abilities.\nThis rule says that you could be exceptional in six out of",

Make a list of your most important output responsibilities and\nmake sure that the people above you, next to you and below you arein agreement with it.\nFor example, for a salesperson, opening new accounts is a key result\narea. This activity is the key to the entire sales process. Closing a saleis a key result area. When the sale is made, it triggers the activities of\nmany other people to produce and deliver the product or service.\nFor a company owner or key executive, negotiating a bank loan is a\nkey result area. Hiring the right people and delegating effectively are\nboth key result areas. For a receptionist or secretary, typing a letter or\nanswering the phone and transferring the caller quickly and\nefficiently are defined as key result areas. The employee’s ability to\nperform these tasks quickly and efficiently largely determines her\npay and promotability.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 52Give Yourself a Grade\nOnce you have determined your key result areas, the second step is\nfor you to grade yourself on a scale of 1-10 in each of those areas.Where are you strong and where are you weak",

    "text": " seven key\nresult areas but really poor in the seventh. And your poorperformance in the seventh area will hold you back and determine\nhow much you achieve with all your other skills. This weakness will\nact as a drag on your effectiveness and be a constant source of frictionand frustration.\nFor example, delegating is a key result area for a manager. This skill is\nthe key leverage point that enables a manager to manage, to get resultsthrough others. A manager who cannot delegate properly is held back\nfrom using all his or her other skills at their maximum level of\neffectiveness. Poor delegation skills alone can lead to failure in the job.\nPoor Performance Produces Procrastination\nOne of the major reasons for procrastination and delay in the\nworkplace is that people avoid jobs and activities in those areas\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 53where they have performed poorly in the past. Instead of setting a\ngoal and making a plan to improve in a particular area, most people\navoid that area altogether, which just makes the situation worse.\nThe reverse of this is that, the better you become in a particular skill\narea, the more motivated you will be to perform that function, the\nless you will procrastinate and the more determined you will be to\nget it finished.\nThe fact is that everybody has both strengths and weaknesses. Refuse\nto rationalize, justify or defend your areas of weakness. Instead,\nidentify them clearly. Set a goal and make a plan to become verygood in each of those areas. Just think! You may be only one critical\nskill away from top performance at your job.\nThe Great Question\nHere is one of the greatest questions you will ever ask and answer:\n\"What one skill, if I developed and did it in an excellent fashion,\nwould have the greatest positive impact on my career?\"\nYou should use this question to guide your career for the rest of your\nlife. Look into yourself for the answer. You usually know what it is.\nAsk your boss this question. Ask your coworkers. Ask your friends\nand your family. Whatever it is, find out and then go to work to bring\nup your performance in this area.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 54The good news is that all business skills are learnable . If anyone else is\nexcellent in that particular key result area, this is proof that you can\nbecome excellent as well, if you decide to.\nOne of the fastest and best ways to stop procrastinating and get more\nthings done faster is for you to become absolutely excellent in your\nkey result areas. This can be as important as anything else you do in\nyour life or your career.\nEat That Frog!\n1.  Identify the key result areas of your work. What are they? Write\ndown the key results you have to get to do your job in an excellent\nfashion. Give yourself a grade from 1-10 on each one. And then\ndetermine the one key skill that, if you did it in an excellent manner,\nwould help you the most in your work.\n2.  Take this list to your boss and discuss it with him or her. Invite\nhonest feedback and appraisal. You can only get better when you are\nopen to the constructive inputs of other people. Discuss your results\nwith your staff and coworkers. Talk them over with your spouse.\nMake a habit of doing this analysis regularly for the rest of your\ncareer. Never stop improving. This decision alone can change your\nlife.",

    "text": " seven key\nresult areas but really poor in the seventh. And your poorperformance in the seventh area will hold you back and determine\nhow much you achieve with all your other skills. This weakness will\nact as a drag on your effectiveness and be a constant source of frictionand frustration.\nFor example, delegating is a key result area for a manager. This skill is\nthe key leverage point that enables a manager to manage, to get resultsthrough others. A manager who cannot delegate properly is held back\nfrom using all his or her other skills at their maximum level of\neffectiveness. Poor delegation skills alone can lead to failure in the job.\nPoor Performance Produces Procrastination\nOne of the major reasons for procrastination and delay in the\nworkplace is that people avoid jobs and activities in those areas\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 53where they have performed poorly in the past. Instead of setting a\ngoal and making a plan to improve in a particular area, most people\navoid that area altogether, which just makes the situation worse.\nThe reverse of this is that, the better you become in a particular skill\narea, the more motivated you will be to perform that function, the\nless you will procrastinate and the more determined you will be to\nget it finished.\nThe fact is that everybody has both strengths and weaknesses. Refuse\nto rationalize, justify or defend your areas of weakness. Instead,\nidentify them clearly. Set a goal and make a plan to become verygood in each of those areas. Just think! You may be only one critical\nskill away from top performance at your job.\nThe Great Question\nHere is one of the greatest questions you will ever ask and answer:\n\"What one skill, if I developed and did it in an excellent fashion,\nwould have the greatest positive impact on my career?\"\nYou should use this question to guide your career for the rest of your\nlife. Look into yourself for the answer. You usually know what it is.\nAsk your boss this question. Ask your coworkers. Ask your friends\nand your family. Whatever it is, find out and then go to work to bring\nup your performance in this area.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 54The good news is that all business skills are learnable . If anyone else is\nexcellent in that particular key result area, this is proof that you can\nbecome excellent as well, if you decide to.\nOne of the fastest and best ways to stop procrastinating",

Refuse\nto rationalize, justify or defend your areas of weakness. Instead,\nidentify them clearly. Set a goal and make a plan to become verygood in each of those areas. Just think! You may be only one critical\nskill away from top performance at your job.\nThe Great Question\nHere is one of the greatest questions you will ever ask and answer:\n\"What one skill, if I developed and did it in an excellent fashion,\nwould have the greatest positive impact on my career?\"\nYou should use this question to guide your career for the rest of your\nlife. Look into yourself for the answer. You usually know what it is.\nAsk your boss this question. Ask your coworkers. Ask your friends\nand your family. Whatever it is, find out and then go to work to bring\nup your performance in this area.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 54The good news is that",

    "text": " all business skills are learnable . If anyone else is\nexcellent in that particular key result area, this is proof that you can\nbecome excellent as well, if you decide to.\nOne of the fastest and best ways to stop procrastinating and get more\nthings done faster is for you to become absolutely excellent in your\nkey result areas. This can be as important as anything else you do in\nyour life or your career.\nEat That Frog!\n1.  Identify the key result areas of your work. What are they? Write\ndown the key results you have to get to do your job in an excellent\nfashion. Give yourself a grade from 1-10 on each one. And then\ndetermine the one key skill that, if you did it in an excellent manner,\nwould help you the most in your work.\n2.  Take this list to your boss and discuss it with him or her. Invite\nhonest feedback and appraisal. You can only get better when you are\nopen to the constructive inputs of other people. Discuss your results\nwith your staff and coworkers. Talk them over with your spouse.\nMake a habit of doing this analysis regularly for the rest of your\ncareer. Never stop improving. This decision alone can change your\nlife.",

Invite\nhonest feedback and appraisal. You can only get better when you are\nopen to the constructive inputs of other people. Discuss your results\nwith your staff and coworkers. Talk them over with your spouse.\nMake a habit of doing this analysis regularly for the rest of your\ncareer. Never stop improving. This decision alone can",
