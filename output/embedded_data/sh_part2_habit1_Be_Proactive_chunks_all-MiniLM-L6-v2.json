Try to project your consciousness upward \ninto a corner of the room and see yourself, in your  mind's eye, reading.  Can you look at yourself \nalmost as though yo u were someone else? \n   Now try something else.  Think about the mood  you are now in.  Can you identify it? What are \nyou feeling? How would you describe your present mental state    Now think for a minute about how your mind is wo rking.  Is it quick and alert? Do you sense that \nyou are torn between doing this me ntal exercise and evaluating th e point to be made out of it? \n   Your ability to do what you just did is unique ly human.  Animals do not possess this ability.  We \ncall it \"self-awareness\" or the ability to think about yo ur very thought process.  This is the reason why \nman has dominion over all things in the world and why he can make significant advances from \ngeneration to generation.    This is why we can evaluate and learn from othe rs' experiences as well as our own.  This is also \nwhy we can make and break our habits.    We are not our feelings.  We are not our moods.  We are not even our thoughts.  The very fact that we can think about these things separates us from them and from the animal world.  \nSelf-awareness enables us to stand apart and examin e even the way we \"see\" ourselves -- our paradigm, \nthe most fundamental paradigm of effectiveness.  It  affects not only our atti tudes and behaviors, but \nalso how we see other people.  It becomes our map of the basic nature of mankind. \n   In fact, until we take how we see ourselves (and  how we see others) into account, we will be unable \nto understand how others see and feel about themse lves and their world.  Unaware, we will be unable \nto understand how others see and feel about them selves and their world.  Unaware, we will project \nour intentions on their behavior and call ourselves objective.    This significantly limits our personal potential and our ability to relate to others as well.  But \nbecause of the unique human capacity of self-aw areness, we can examine our paradigms to determine \nwhether they are reality- or principle-based or if they are a function of conditioning and conditions. \n The Social Mirror     If the only vision we have of ourselves come s from the social mirror -- from the current social \nparadigm and from the opinions, pe rceptions, and paradigms of the people around us -- our view of \nourselves is like the reflection in th e crazy mirror room at the carnival. \n   \"You're never on time.\"    \"Why can't you ever keep things in order?\"    \"You must be an artist!\"    \"You eat like a horse!\"    \"I can't believe you won!\" \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n   \"This is so simple.  Why can't you understand?\" \n   These visions are disjointed and out of proportion .  They are often more proj ections than reflections, \nprojecting the concerns and cha racter weaknesses of people giving the input rather than accurately \nreflecting what we are.    The reflection of the current social paradigm te lls us we are largely determined by conditioning and \nconditions.  While we have acknowledged the tremen dous power of conditioning in our lives, to say \nthat we are determined by it, that we have no control over that influence, creates quite a different map. \n   There are actually three social maps -- three th eories of determinism wide ly accepted, independently \nor in combination, to explain the nature of man.  Genetic determinism basically says your \ngrandparents did it to you.  That's why you ha ve such a temper.  Your grandparents had short \ntempers and it's in your DNA.  It",

Try to project your consciousness upward \ninto a corner of the room and see yourself, in your  mind's eye, reading.  Can you look at yourself \nalmost as though yo u were someone else? \n   Now try something else.  Think about the mood  you are now in.  Can you identify it? What are \nyou feeling? How would you describe your present mental state    Now think for a minute about how your mind is wo rking.  Is it quick and alert? Do you sense that \nyou are torn between doing this me ntal exercise and evaluating th e point to be made out of it? \n   Your ability to do what you just did is unique ly human.  Animals do not possess this ability.  We \ncall it \"self-awareness\" or the ability to think about yo ur very thought process.  This is the reason why \nman has dominion over all things in the world and why he can make significant advances from \ngeneration to generation.    This is why we can evaluate and learn from othe rs' experiences as well as our own.  This is also \nwhy we can make and break our habits.    We are not our feelings.  We are not our moods.  We are not even our thoughts.  The very fact that we can think about these things separates us from them and from the animal world.  \nSelf-awareness enables us to stand apart and examin e even the way we \"see\" ourselves -- our paradigm, \nthe most fundamental paradigm of effectiveness.  It  affects not only our atti tudes and behaviors, but \nalso how we see other people.  It becomes our map of the basic nature of mankind. \n   In fact, until we take how we see ourselves (and  how we see others) into account",

Try to project your consciousness upward \ninto a corner of the room and see yourself, in your  mind's eye, reading.  Can you look at yourself \nalmost as though yo u were someone else? \n   Now try something else.  Think about the mood  you are now in.  Can you identify it? What are \nyou feeling? How would you describe your present mental state    Now think for a minute about how your mind is wo rking.  Is it quick and alert? Do you sense that \nyou are torn between doing this me ntal exercise",

It becomes our map of the basic nature of mankind. \n   In fact, until we take how we see ourselves (and  how we see others) into account, we will be unable \nto understand how others see and feel about themse lves and their world.  Unaware, we will be unable \nto understand how others see and feel about them selves and their world.  Unaware, we will project \nour intentions on their behavior and call ourselves objective.    This significantly limits our personal potential and our ability to relate to others as well.  But \nbecause of the unique human capacity of self-aw areness, we can examine our paradigms to determine \nwhether they are reality- or principle-based or if they are a function of conditioning and conditions. \n The Social Mirror     If the only vision we have of ourselves come s from the social mirror -- from the current social \nparadigm and from the opinions, pe rceptions, and paradigms of the people around us -- our view of \nourselves is like the reflection in th e crazy mirror room at the carnival. \n   \"You're never on time.\"    \"Why can't you ever keep things in order?\"    \"You must be an artist!\"    \"You eat like a horse!\"    \"I can't believe you won!\" \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n   \"This is so simple.  Why can't you understand?\" \n   These visions are disjointed and out of proportion .  They are often more proj ections than reflections, \nprojecting the concerns and cha racter weaknesses of people giving the input rather than accurately \nreflecting what we are.    The reflection of the current social paradigm te lls us we are largely determined by conditioning and \nconditions.  While we have acknowledged the tremen dous power of conditioning in our lives, to say \nthat we are determined by it, that we have no control over that influence, creates quite a different map. \n   There are actually three social maps -- three th eories of determinism wide ly accepted, independently \nor in combination,",

It becomes our map of the basic nature of mankind. \n   In fact, until we take how we see ourselves (and  how we see others) into account, we will be unable \nto understand how others see and feel about themse lves and their world.  Unaware, we will be unable \nto understand how others see and feel about them selves and their world.  Unaware, we will project \nour intentions on their behavior and call ourselves objective.    This significantly limits our personal potential and our ability to relate to others as well.  But \nbecause of the unique human capacity of self-aw areness, we can examine our paradigms to determine \nwhether they are reality- or principle-based or if they are a function of conditioning and conditions. \n The Social Mirror     If the only vision we have of ourselves come s from the social mirror -- from the current social \nparadigm and from the opinions, pe rceptions, and paradigms of the people around us -- our view of \nourselves is like the reflection in th e crazy mirror room at the carnival. \n   \"You're never on time.\"    \"Why can't",

    "text": " to explain the nature of man.  Genetic determinism basically says your \ngrandparents did it to you.  That's why you ha ve such a temper.  Your grandparents had short \ntempers and it's in your DNA.  It just goes throug h the generations and you inherited it.  In addition, \nyou're Irish, and that's the nature of Irish people.    Psychic determinism basically says your parents did it to you.  Your upbringing, your childhood \nexperience essentially laid out your personal tend encies and your character structure.  That's why \nyou're afraid to be in front of a group.  It's th e way your parents brought you up.  You feel terribly \nguilty if you make a mistake because you \"remember\"  deep inside the emotional scripting when you \nwere very vulnerable and tender and dependent.  You \"remember\" the emotional punishment, the \nrejection, the comparison with somebody else when you didn't perform as well as expected. \n   Environmental determinism basically says your boss  is doing to you -- or your spouse, or that bratty \nteenager, or your economic situation, or national policies.  Someone or some thing in your environment \nis responsible for your situation.    Each of these maps is based on the stimulus/r esponse theory we most ofte n think of in connection \nwith Pavlov's experiments with dogs.  The basic idea is that we are conditioned to respond in a \nparticular way to a particular stimulus.    How accurately and functionally do these determ inistic maps describe the territory? How clearly do \nthese mirrors reflect the true nature of man? Do th ey become self-fulfilling prophecies? Are they based \non principles we can validate within ourselves?  Between Stimulus and Response     In answer to those questions, let me share  with you the catalytic story of Viktor Frankl. \n   Frankl was a determinist raised in the traditio n of Freudian psychology,  which postulates that \nwhatever happens to you as a child shapes your character and personality and basically governs your \nwhole life.  The limits and parameters of your life are  set, and, basically, you can't do much about it. \n   Frankl was also a psychiatrist and a Jew.  He was imprisoned in the deat h camps of Nazi Germany, \nwhere he experienced things that were so repugnant to our sense of decency that we shudder to even \nrepeat them.    His parents, his brother, and his wife died in th e camps or were sent to the gas ovens.  Except for \nhis sister, his entire family perished.  Frankl hi mself suffered torture and innumerable indignities, \nnever knowing from one moment to the next if his path would lead to the ovens or if he would be \namong the \"saved\" who would remove the bodies or shovel out the ashes of those so fated. \n   One day, naked and alone in a small room, he be gan to become aware of what he later called \"the \nlast of the human freedoms\" -- the freedom his Nazi  captors could not take away.  They could control \nhis entire environment, they coul d do what they wanted to his body, but Viktor Frankl himself was a \nself-aware being who could look as an observer at hi s very involvement.  His ba sic identity was intact.  \nHe could decide within himself how all of this was going to affect him.  Between what happened to \nhim, or the stimulus, and his response to it, wa s his freedom or power to choose that response. \n   In the midst of his experiences, Frankl would pr oject himself into different circumstances, such as \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \nlecturing to his students after his release from th e death camps.  He would describe himself in the \nclassroom, in his mind's eye, and give his students the lessons he was learning during his very torture. \n   Through a series of such disciplines -- mental , emotional, and moral, principally using memory and \nimagination -- he exercised his small, embryonic freed om until it grew larger and larger, until he had \nmore freedom than his Nazi captors.  They had mo re liberty, more options to choose from in their \nenvironment; but he had more freedom, more internal  power to exercise his options.  He became an \ninspiration to those around him, even to some of th e guards.  He helped others find meaning in their \nsuffering and dignity in their prison existence.    In the midst of",

    "text": " to explain the nature of man.  Genetic determinism basically says your \ngrandparents did it to you.  That's why you ha ve such a temper.  Your grandparents had short \ntempers and it's in your DNA.  It just goes throug h the generations and you inherited it.  In addition, \nyou're Irish, and that's the nature of Irish people.    Psychic determinism basically says your parents did it to you.  Your upbringing, your childhood \nexperience essentially laid out your personal tend encies and your character structure.  That's why \nyou're afraid to be in front of a group.  It's th e way your parents brought you up.  You feel terribly \nguilty if you make a mistake because you \"remember\"  deep inside the emotional scripting when you \nwere very vulnerable and tender and dependent.  You \"remember\" the emotional punishment, the \nrejection, the comparison with somebody else when you didn't perform as well as expected. \n   Environmental determinism basically says your boss  is doing to you -- or your spouse, or that bratty \nteenager, or your economic situation, or national policies.  Someone or some thing in your environment \nis responsible for your situation.    Each of these maps is based on the stimulus/r esponse theory we most ofte n think of in connection \nwith Pavlov's experiments with dogs.  The basic idea is that we are conditioned to respond in a \nparticular way to a particular stimulus.    How accurately and functionally do these determ inistic maps describe the territory? How clearly do \nthese mirrors reflect the true nature of man? Do th ey become self-fulfilling prophecies? Are they based \non principles we can validate within ourselves?  Between Stimulus and Response     In answer to those questions, let me share  with you the catalytic story of Viktor Frankl. \n   Frankl was a determinist raised in the traditio n of Freudian psychology,  which postulates that \nwhatever happens to you as a child shapes your character and personality and basically governs your \nwhole life.  The limits and parameters of your life are  set, and, basically, you can't do much about it. \n   Frankl was also a psychiatrist and a Jew.  He was imprisoned in the deat h camps of Nazi Germany, \nwhere he experienced things that were so repugnant to our sense of decency that we shudder to",

Your grandparents had short \ntempers and it's in your DNA.  It just goes throug h the generations and you inherited it.  In addition, \nyou're Irish, and that's the nature of Irish people.    Psychic determinism basically says your parents did it to you.  Your upbringing, your childhood \nexperience essentially laid out your personal tend encies and your character structure.  That's why \nyou're afraid to be in front of a group.  It's th e way your parents brought you up.  You feel terribly \nguilty if you make a mistake because you \"remember\"  deep inside the emotional scripting when you \nwere very vulnerable and tender and dependent.  You \"remember\" the emotional punishment, the \nrejection, the comparison with somebody else when you didn't perform as well as expected. \n   Environmental determinism basically says your boss  is doing to you -- or your spouse, or that bratty \nteenager, or your economic situation, or national policies.  Someone or some thing in your environment \nis responsible for your situation",

    "text": " \n   Environmental determinism basically says your boss  is doing to you -- or your spouse, or that bratty \nteenager, or your economic situation, or national policies.  Someone or some thing in your environment \nis responsible for your situation.    Each of these maps is based on the stimulus/r esponse theory we most ofte n think of in connection \nwith Pavlov's experiments with dogs.  The basic idea is that we are conditioned to respond in a \nparticular way to a particular stimulus.    How accurately and functionally do these determ inistic maps describe the territory? How clearly do \nthese mirrors reflect the true nature of man? Do th ey become self-fulfilling prophecies? Are they based \non principles we can validate within ourselves?  Between Stimulus and Response     In answer to those questions, let me share  with you the catalytic story of Viktor Frankl. \n   Frankl was a determinist raised in the traditio n of Freudian psychology,  which postulates that \nwhatever happens to you as a child shapes your character and personality and basically governs your \nwhole life.  The limits and parameters of your life are  set, and, basically, you can't do much",

He was imprisoned in the deat h camps of Nazi Germany, \nwhere he experienced things that were so repugnant to our sense of decency that we shudder to even \nrepeat them.    His parents, his brother, and his wife died in th e camps or were sent to the gas ovens.  Except for \nhis sister, his entire family perished.  Frankl hi mself suffered torture and innumerable indignities, \nnever knowing from one moment to the next if his path would lead to the ovens or if he would be \namong the \"saved\" who would remove the bodies or shovel out the ashes of those so fated. \n   One day, naked and alone in a small room, he be gan to become aware of what he later called \"the \nlast of the human freedoms\" -- the freedom his Nazi  captors could not take away.  They could control \nhis entire environment, they coul d do what they wanted to his body, but Viktor Frankl himself was a \nself-aware being who could look as an observer at hi s very involvement.  His ba sic identity was intact.  \nHe could decide within himself how all of this was going to affect him.  Between what happened to \nhim, or the stimulus, and his response to it, wa s his freedom or power to choose that response. \n   In the midst of his experiences, Frankl would pr oject himself into different circumstances, such as \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \nlecturing to his students after his release from th e death camps.  He would describe himself in the \nclassroom, in his mind's eye, and give his students the lessons he was learning during his very torture. \n   Through a series of such disciplines -- mental , emotional, and moral, principally using memory and \nimagination -- he exercised his small, embryonic freed om until it grew larger and larger, until he had \nmore freedom than his Nazi captors.  They had mo re liberty, more options to choose from in their \nenvironment; but he had more freedom, more internal ",

He was imprisoned in the deat h camps of Nazi Germany, \nwhere he experienced things that were so repugnant to our sense of decency that we shudder to even \nrepeat them.    His parents, his brother, and his wife died in th e camps or were sent to the gas ovens.  Except for \nhis sister, his entire family perished.  Frankl hi mself suffered torture and innumerable indignities, \nnever knowing from one moment to the next if his path would lead to the ovens or if he would be \namong the \"saved\" who would remove the bodies or shovel out the ashes of those so fated. \n   One day, naked and alone in a small room, he be gan to become aware of what he later called \"the \nlast of the human freedoms\" -- the freedom his Nazi  captors could not take away.  They could control \nhis entire environment, they coul d do what they wanted to his body, but Viktor Frankl himself was a \nself-aware being who could look as an observer at hi s very involvement.  His ba sic identity was intact.  \nHe could decide within himself",

    "text": " power to exercise his options.  He became an \ninspiration to those around him, even to some of th e guards.  He helped others find meaning in their \nsuffering and dignity in their prison existence.    In the midst of the most de grading circumstances imaginable, F rankl used the human endowment of \nself-awareness to discover a fundamental principle about the nature of man: Between stimulus and \nresponse, man has the freedom to choose.    Within the freedom to choose are those endowments  that make us uniquely human.  In addition to \nself-awareness, we have imagination -- the ability to create in our minds beyond our present reality.  \nWe have conscience -- a deep inner awareness of ri ght and wrong, of the principles that govern our \nbehavior, and a sense of the degree to which our thou ghts and actions are in harmony with them.  And \nwe have independent will -- the ability to act based on our self-awareness, free of all other influences. \n   Even the most intelligent animals have none of  these endowments.  To use a computer metaphor, \nthey are programmed by instin ct and/or training.  They can be trai ned to be responsible, but they can't \ntake responsibility for that training; in other word s, they can't direct it.  They can't change the \nprogramming.  They're not even aware of it.    But because of our unique human endowments , we can write new programs for ourselves totally \napart from our instincts and training.  This is why an animal's capacity is relatively limited and man's \nis unlimited.  But if we live like animals, out of ou r own instincts and conditioning and conditions, out \nof our collective memory, we too will be limited.    The deterministic paradigm comes primarily from  the study of animals -- rats, monkeys, pigeons, \ndogs -- and neurotic and psychotic people.  While th is may meet certain criteria of some researchers \nbecause it seems measurable and predictable, the hi story of mankind and our own self-awareness tell us \nthat this map doesn't describe the territory at all!    Our unique human endowments lift us above the animal world.  The extent to which we exercise \nand develop these endowments empowers us to fulfill our uniquely human potential.  Between \nstimulus and response is our greate st power -- the freedom to choose. \n \"Proactivity\" Defined     In discovering the basic principle of the nature of man, Frankl described an accurate self-map from \nwhich he began to develop the first and most ba sic habit of a highly e ffective person in any \nenvironment, the habit of Proactivity.    While the word proactivity is now fairly common in management literature, it is a word you won't \nfind in most dictionaries.  It means more than merely  taking initiative.  It means that as human beings, \nwe are responsible for our own lives.  Our behavior is  a function of our decisions, not our conditions.  \nWe can subordinate feelings to values.  We have th e initiative and the respon sibility to make things \nhappen.    Look at the word responsibility -- \"response-ab ility\" -- the ability to choose your response.  Highly \nproactive people recognize that responsibility.  They do not blame circum stances, conditions, or \nconditioning for their behavior.  Their behavior is  a product of their own conscious choice, based on \nvalues, rather than a product of th eir conditions, based on feeling. \n   Because we are, by nature, proactive, if our lives are a function of conditioning and conditions, it is \nbecause we have, by conscious decision or by defaul t, chosen to empower those things to control us. \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n   In making such a choice, we become reactive.  Re active people are often affected by their physical \nenvironment.  If the weather is good, they feel good .  If it isn't, it affects their attitude and their \nperformance.  Proactive people can carry their own weather with them.  Whether it rains or shines \nmakes no difference to them.  They are value driven ; and if their value is to produce good quality \nwork, it isn't a function of whether the weather is conducive to it or not.    Reactive people are also affected by their soci al environment, by the \"social weather.\" When people \ntreat them well, they feel well; when people don't,  they become defensive or protective.  Reactive \npeople build their emotional lives around the behavi or of others",

He helped others find meaning in their \nsuffering and dignity in their prison existence.    In the midst of the most de grading circumstances imaginable, F rankl used the human endowment of \nself-awareness to discover a fundamental principle about the nature of man: Between stimulus and \nresponse, man has the freedom to choose.    Within the freedom to choose are those endowments  that make us uniquely human.  In addition to \nself-awareness, we have imagination -- the ability to create in our minds beyond our present reality.  \nWe have conscience -- a deep inner awareness of ri ght and wrong, of the principles that govern our \nbehavior, and a sense of the degree to which our thou ghts and actions are in harmony with them.  And \nwe have independent will -- the ability to act based on our self-awareness, free of all other influences. \n   Even the most intelligent animals have none of  these endowments.  To use a computer metaphor, \nthey are programmed by instin ct and/or training.  They can be trai ned to be responsible, but they can't \ntake responsibility for that training; in other word s, they can't direct it.  They can't change the \nprogramming.  They're not even aware of it.    But because of our unique human endowments , we can write new programs for ourselves totally \napart from our instincts and training.  This is why an animal's capacity is relatively limited and man's \nis unlimited.  But if we live like animals, out of ou r own instincts and conditioning and conditions, out \nof our collective memory, we too will be limited.    The deterministic paradigm comes primarily from  the study of animals -- rats, monkeys, pigeons, \ndogs -- and neurotic and psychotic people.  While th is may meet certain criteria of some researchers \nbecause it seems measurable and predictable, the hi story of mankind and our own self-awareness tell us \nthat this map doesn't describe the territory at all!    Our unique human endowments lift us above the animal world.  The extent to which we exercise \nand develop these endowments empowers us to fulfill our uniquely human potential.  Between \nstimulus and response is our greate st power -- the freedom to choose. \n \"Proactivity\" Defined     In discovering",

They can be trai ned to be responsible, but they can't \ntake responsibility for that training; in other word s, they can't direct it.  They can't change the \nprogramming.  They're not even aware of it.    But because of our unique human endowments , we can write new programs for ourselves totally \napart from our instincts and training.  This is why an animal's capacity is relatively limited and man's \nis unlimited.  But if we live like animals, out of ou r own instincts and conditioning and conditions, out \nof our collective memory, we too will be limited.    The deterministic paradigm comes primarily from  the study of animals -- rats, monkeys, pigeons, \ndogs -- and neurotic and psychotic people.  While th is may meet certain criteria of some researchers \nbecause it seems measurable and predictable, the hi story of mankind and our own self-awareness tell us \nthat this map doesn't describe the territory at all!

Between \nstimulus and response is our greate st power -- the freedom to choose. \n \"Proactivity\" Defined     In discovering the basic principle of the nature of man, Frankl described an accurate self-map from \nwhich he began to develop the first and most ba sic habit of a highly e ffective person in any \nenvironment, the habit of Proactivity.    While the word proactivity is now fairly common in management literature, it is a word you won't \nfind in most dictionaries.  It means more than merely  taking initiative.  It means that as human beings, \nwe are responsible for our own lives.  Our behavior is  a function of our decisions, not our conditions.  \nWe can subordinate feelings to values.  We have th e initiative and the respon sibility to make things \nhappen.    Look at the word responsibility -- \"response-ab ility\" -- the ability to choose your response.  Highly \nproactive people recognize that responsibility.  They do not blame circum stances, conditions, or \nconditioning for their behavior.  Their behavior is  a product of their own conscious choice, based on \nvalues, rather than a product of th eir conditions, based on feeling. \n   Because we are, by nature, proactive, if our lives are a function of conditioning and conditions, it is \nbecause we have, by conscious decision or by defaul t, chosen to empower those things to control us. \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n   In making such a choice, we become reactive.  Re active people are often affected by their physical \nenvironment.  If the weather is good, they feel good .  If it isn't, it affects their attitude and their \nperformance.  Proactive people can carry their own weather with them.  Whether it rains or shines \nmakes no difference to them.

    "text": " extent to which we exercise \nand develop these endowments empowers us to fulfill our uniquely human potential.  Between \nstimulus and response is our greate st power -- the freedom to choose. \n \"Proactivity\" Defined     In discovering the basic principle of the nature of man, Frankl described an accurate self-map from \nwhich he began to develop the first and most ba sic habit of a highly e ffective person in any \nenvironment, the habit of Proactivity.    While the word proactivity is now fairly common in management literature, it is a word you won't \nfind in most dictionaries.  It means more than merely  taking initiative.  It means that as human beings, \nwe are responsible for our own lives.  Our behavior is  a function of our decisions, not our conditions.  \nWe can subordinate feelings to values.  We have th e initiative and the respon sibility to make things \nhappen.    Look at the word responsibility -- \"response-ab ility\" -- the ability to choose your response.  Highly \nproactive people recognize that responsibility.  They do not blame circum stances, conditions, or \nconditioning for their behavior.  Their behavior is  a product of their own conscious",

    "text": " their soci al environment, by the \"social weather.\" When people \ntreat them well, they feel well; when people don't,  they become defensive or protective.  Reactive \npeople build their emotional lives around the behavi or of others, empowering the weaknesses of other \npeople to control them.    The ability to subordinate an impulse to a value is the essence of the proa ctive person.  Reactive \npeople are driven by feelings, by circumstances, by conditions, by th eir environment.  Proactive people \nare driven by values -- carefully thought about, selected and internalized values. \n   Proactive people are still influenced by external stimuli, whether physical, social, or psychological.  \nBut their response to the stimuli, conscious or un conscious, is a value-based choice or response. \n   As Eleanor Roosevelt observed, \"No one can hu rt you without your consent.\" In the words of \nGandhi, \"They cannot take away our self respect if  we do not give it to them.\" It is our willing \npermission, our consent to what happe ns to us, that hurts us far more than what happens to us in the \nfirst place.    I admit this is very hard to accept emotionally, especially if we have had years and years of \nexplaining our misery in the name of circumstance or someone else's behavior.  But until a person can \nsay deeply and honestly, \"I am what  I am today because of the choice s I made yesterday,\" that person \ncannot say, \"I choose otherwise.\"    Once in Sacramento when I was speaking on th e subject of Proactivity, a woman in the audience \nstood up in the middle of my presentation and start ed talking excitedly.  It was a large audience, and \nas a number of people turned to look at her, she suddenly became aware of what she was doing, grew \nembarrassed and sat back down.  But she seemed to find it difficult to restrain herself and started \ntalking to the people around her.  She seemed so happy.    I could hardly wait for a break to find ou t what had happened.  When it finally came, I \nimmediately went to her and asked if she would be willing to share her experience.    \"You just can't imagine what's happened to me!\" she exclaimed.  \"I'm a full-time nurse to the most \nmiserable, ungrateful man you can possibly imagine.  Nothing I do is good enough for him.  He never \nexpresses appreciation; he hardly even acknowledges  me.  He constantly harp s at me and finds fault \nwith everything I do.  This man has made my life mi serable and I often take my  frustration out on my \nfamily.  The other nurses feel the same way.  We almost pray for his demise.    \"And for you to have the gall to stand up there and suggest that nothing can hurt me, that no one can hurt me without my consent, and that I have chosen my own emotional life of being miserable -- \nwell, there was just no way I could buy into that.    \"But I kept thinking about it.  I really went insi de myself and began to ask, 'Do I have the power to \nchoose my response?\"    \"When I finally realized that I do have that power, when I swallowed that bitter pill and realized \nthat I had chosen to be miserable, I also rea lized that I could choose not to be miserable. \n   \"At that moment I stood up.  I felt as though I was being let out of San Quentin.  I wanted to yell \nto the whole world, 'I am free! I am let out of pr ison! No longer am I going to be controlled by the \ntreatment of some person.'\"    It's not what happens to us, but our response to what happens to us that hu rts us.  Of course, things \ncan hurt us physically or economically and can cause sorrow.  But our character, our basic identity, \ndoes not have to be hurt at all.  In fact, our most  difficult experiences become the crucibles that forge \nour character and develop the internal powers, the fr eedom to handle difficult circumstances in the \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \nfuture and to inspire others to do so as well. \n   Frankl is one of many who have been able  to develop the personal freedom in difficult \ncircumstances to lift and inspire others.  The auto biographical accounts of Vietnam prisoners of war \nprovide additional persuasive testimony of the tran sforming power of such personal freedom and",

Reactive \npeople build their emotional lives around the behavi or of others, empowering the weaknesses of other \npeople to control them.    The ability to subordinate an impulse to a value is the essence of the proa ctive person.  Reactive \npeople are driven by feelings, by circumstances, by conditions, by th eir environment.  Proactive people \nare driven by values -- carefully thought about, selected and internalized values. \n   Proactive people are still influenced by external stimuli, whether physical, social, or psychological.  \nBut their response to the stimuli, conscious or un conscious, is a value-based choice or response. \n   As Eleanor Roosevelt observed, \"No one can hu rt you without your consent.\" In the words of \nGandhi, \"They cannot take away our self respect if  we do not give it to them.\" It is our willing \npermission, our consent to what happe ns to us, that hurts us far more than what happens to us in the \nfirst place.    I admit this is very hard to accept emotionally, especially if we have had years and years of \nexplaining our misery in the name of circumstance or someone else's behavior.  But until a person can \nsay deeply and honestly, \"I am what  I am today because of the choice s I made yesterday,\" that person \ncannot say, \"I choose otherwise.\"    Once in Sacramento when I was speaking on th e subject of Proactivity, a woman in the audience \nstood up in the middle of my presentation and start ed talking excitedly.  It was a large audience, and \nas a number of people turned to look at her, she suddenly became aware of what she was doing, grew \nembarrassed and sat back down.  But she seemed to find it difficult to restrain herself and started \ntalking to the people around her.  She seemed so happy.    I could hardly wait for a break to find ou t what had happened.  When it finally came, I \nimmediately went to her and asked if she would be willing to share her experience.    \"You just can't imagine what's happened to me!\" she exclaimed.  \"I'm a full-time nurse to the most \nmiserable, ungrateful man you can possibly imagine.  Nothing I do is good",

    "text": " many who have been able  to develop the personal freedom in difficult \ncircumstances to lift and inspire others.  The auto biographical accounts of Vietnam prisoners of war \nprovide additional persuasive testimony of the tran sforming power of such personal freedom and the \neffect of the responsible use of that freedom on the prison culture and on the prisoners, both then and \nnow.    We have all known individuals in very difficult  circumstances, perhaps wi th a terminal illness or a \nsevere physical handicap, who maintain magnific ent emotional strength.  How inspired we are by \ntheir integrity! Nothing has a greater, longer la sting impression upon an other person than the \nawareness that someone has transcended suffering, has transcended circumstance, and is embodying \nand expressing a value that inspires and ennobles and lifts life.    One of the most inspiring times Sandra and I have  ever had took place over a four-year period with \na dear friend of ours named Carol,  who had a wasting cancer disease.   She had been one of Sandra's \nbridesmaids, and they had been best friends for over 25 years.    When Carol was in the very la st stages of the disease, Sandra spent time at her bedside helping her \nwrite her personal history.  She returned from thos e protracted and difficult sessions almost transfixed \nby admiration for her friend's courage and her desi re to write special messages to be given to her \nchildren at different stages in their lives.    Carol would take as little pain-killing medication as  possible so that she had full access to her mental \nand emotional faculties.  Then she would whisper into a tape recorder or to Sandra directly as she took \nnotes.  Carol was so proactive, so brave, and so concerned about others that she became an enormous \nsource of inspiration to many people around her.    I'll never forget the experience of looking deep ly into Carol's eyes the day before she passed away \nand sensing out of that deep hollo wed agony a person of tremendous intrinsic worth.  I could see in \nher eyes a life of character, contribution, and serv ice as well as love, concern, and appreciation. \n   Many times over the years, I have asked groups of people how many have ever experienced being in \nthe presence of a dying indivi dual who had a magnificent attitude and communicated love and \ncompassion and served in unmatchable ways to th e very end.  Usually, about one-fourth of the \naudience respond in the affirmative.  I then ask ho w many of them will never forget these individuals \n-- how many were transformed, at least temporarily , by the inspiration of such courage, and were \ndeeply moved and motivated to more noble acts of service and compassion.  The same people respond \nagain, almost inevitably.    Viktor Frankl suggests that there are three cent ral values in life -- the experiential, or that which \nhappens to us; the creative, or that which we bring into  existence; and the attitudinal, or our response in \ndifficult circumstances such as terminal illness.    My own experience with peop le confirms the point Frankl make s -- that the highest of the three \nvalues is attitudinal, in the paradig m of reframing sense.  In other words, what matters most is how we \nrespond to what we experience in life.    Difficult circumstances often create Paradigm Sh ifts, whole new frames of reference by which people \nsee the world and themselves and others in it, and what  life is asking of them.  Their larger perspective \nreflects the attitudinal values that lift and inspire us all.  Taking the Initiative     Our basic nature is to act, and not be acted up on.  As well as enabling us to choose our response to \nparticular circumstances, this empo wers us to create circumstances \n   Taking initiative does not mean being pushy, ob noxious, or aggressive.  It does mean recognizing \nour responsibility to make things happen. \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n   Over the years, I have frequently counseled people  who wanted better jobs to show more initiative -- \nto take interest and aptitude tests, to study the in dustry, even the specific problems the organizations \nthey are interested in are facing, and then to de velop an effective presen tation showing how their \nabilities can help solve the organization's problem.  It 's called \"solution selling,\" and is a key paradigm \nin business success.    The response is usually agreement -- most pe ople can see how powerfully such an approach would \na",

The auto biographical accounts of Vietnam prisoners of war \nprovide additional persuasive testimony of the tran sforming power of such personal freedom and the \neffect of the responsible use of that freedom on the prison culture and on the prisoners, both then and \nnow.    We have all known individuals in very difficult  circumstances, perhaps wi th a terminal illness or a \nsevere physical handicap, who maintain magnific ent emotional strength.  How inspired we are by \ntheir integrity! Nothing has a greater, longer la sting impression upon an other person than the \nawareness that someone has transcended suffering, has transcended circumstance, and is embodying \nand expressing a value that inspires and ennobles and lifts life.    One of the most inspiring times Sandra and I have  ever had took place over a four-year period with \na dear friend of ours named Carol,  who had a wasting cancer disease.   She had been one of Sandra's \nbridesmaids, and they had been best friends for over 25 years.    When Carol was in the very la st stages of the disease, Sandra spent time at her bedside helping her \nwrite her personal history.  She returned from thos e protracted and difficult sessions almost transfixed \nby admiration for her friend's courage and her desi re to write special messages to be given to her \nchildren at different stages in their lives.    Carol would take as little pain-killing medication as  possible so that she had full access to her mental \nand emotional faculties.  Then she would whisper into a tape recorder or to Sandra directly as she took \nnotes.  Carol was so proactive, so brave, and so concerned about others that she became an enormous \nsource of inspiration to many people around her.    I'll never forget the experience of looking deep ly into Carol's eyes the day before she passed away \nand sensing out of that deep hollo wed agony a person of tremendous intrinsic worth.  I could see in \nher eyes a life of character, contribution, and serv ice as well as love, concern, and appreciation. \n   Many times over the years, I have asked groups of people how many have ever experienced being in \nthe presence of a dying indivi dual who had a magnificent attitude and communicated love and \ncompassion and served in unmatchable ways to th e very end.

Usually, about one-fourth of the \naudience respond in the affirmative.  I then ask ho w many of them will never forget these individuals \n-- how many were transformed, at least temporarily , by the inspiration of such courage, and were \ndeeply moved and motivated to more noble acts of service and compassion.

Their larger perspective \nreflects the attitudinal values that lift and inspire us all.  Taking the Initiative     Our basic nature is to act, and not be acted up on.

    "text": "abilities can help solve the organization's problem.  It 's called \"solution selling,\" and is a key paradigm \nin business success.    The response is usually agreement -- most pe ople can see how powerfully such an approach would \naffect their opportunities for employment or adva ncement.  But many of them fail to take the \nnecessary steps, the initiative, to make it happen.    \"I don't know where to go to ta ke the interest and aptitude test.\" \n   \"How do I study industry and organizat ional problems? No one wants to help me.\" \n   Many people wait for something to happen or so meone to take care of them.  But people who end \nup with the good jobs are the proactive ones who are solutions to problems, not problems themselves, \nwho seize the initiative to do whatever is necessary , consistent with correct principles, to get the job \ndone.    Whenever someone in our family, even one of th e younger children, takes an irresponsible position \nand waits for someone else to make things happen or  provide a solution, we tell them, \"Use your R and \nI!\" (resourcefulness and initiative).  In fact, often before we can say it, they answer their own \ncomplaints, \"I know -- use my R and I!\"    Holding people to the responsible course is not demeaning; it is affirming. Proactivity is part of \nhuman nature, and although the proactive muscles may be dormant, they are there.  By respecting the \nproactive nature of other people, we provide them wi th at least one clear, undistorted reflection from \nthe social mirror.    Of course, the maturity level of the individual ha s to be taken into account.  We can't expect high \ncreative cooperation from those who are deep into em otional dependence.  But we can, at least, affirm \ntheir basic nature and create an atmosphere where pe ople can seize opportunities and solve problems in \nan increasingly self-reliant way.  Act or be Acted Upon     The difference between people who exercise initia tive and those who don't is  literally the difference \nbetween night and day.  I'm not talking about a 25 to  50 percent difference in effectiveness; I'm talking \nabout a 5000-plus percent difference, particularly if they are smart, aware, and sensitive to others. \n   It takes initiative to create the P/PC Balance of effectiveness in your life.  It takes initiative to \ndevelop the Seven Habits.  As you study the other six habits, you will see that each depends on the \ndevelopment of your proactive muscles.  Each puts the responsibility on you to act.  If you wait to be \nacted upon, you will be acted upon.  And growth an d opportunity consequences attend either road. \n   At one time I worked with a group of people  in the home improvement industry, representatives \nfrom 20 different organizations who met quarterly  to share their numbers and problems in an \nuninhibited way.    This was during a time of heavy recession, and the negative impact on this particular industry was \neven heavier than on the economy in general.  These people were fairly discouraged as we began. \n   The first day, our discussion question was \"Wha t's happening to us? What's the stimulus?\" Many \nthings were happening.  The environmental pr essures were powerful.  There was widespread \nunemployment, and many of these people were laying off friends just to maintain the viability of their \nenterprises.  By the end of the day, everyone was even more discouraged.    The second day, we addressed the question, \"W hat's going to happen in the future?\" We studied \nenvironmental trends with the unde rlying reactive assumption that those things would create their \nfuture.  By the end of the second day, we were even  more depressed.  Things were going to get worse \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \nbefore they got better, and everyone knew it. \n   So on the third day, we decided to focus on th e proactive question, \"What is our response? What are \nwe going to do? How can we exercise initiative in this situation?\" In the morning we talked about \nmanaging and reducing costs.  In the aftern oon we discussed increasing market share.  We \nbrainstormed both areas, then concentrated on several very practical, very doable things.  A new spirit \nof excitement, hope, and proactive awareness concluded the meetings.    At the every end of the thir d day, we summarized the results of the conference",

The response is usually agreement -- most pe ople can see how powerfully such an approach would \naffect their opportunities for employment or adva ncement.  But many of them fail to take the \nnecessary steps, the initiative, to make it happen.    \"I don't know where to go to ta ke the interest and aptitude test.\" \n   \"How do I study industry and organizat ional problems? No one wants to help me.\" \n   Many people wait for something to happen or so meone to take care of them.  But people who end \nup with the good jobs are the proactive ones who are solutions to problems, not problems themselves, \nwho seize the initiative to do whatever is necessary , consistent with correct principles, to get the job \ndone.    Whenever someone in our family, even one of th e younger children, takes an irresponsible position \nand waits for someone else to make things happen or  provide a solution, we tell them, \"Use your R and \nI!\" (resourcefulness and initiative).  In fact, often before we can say it, they answer their own \ncomplaints, \"I know -- use my R and I!\"    Holding people to the responsible course is not demeaning; it is affirming. Proactivity is part of \nhuman nature, and although the proactive muscles may be dormant, they are there.  By respecting the \nproactive nature of other people, we provide them wi th at least one clear, undistorted reflection from \nthe social mirror.    Of course, the maturity level of the individual ha s to be taken into account.  We can't expect high \ncreative cooperation from those who are deep into em otional dependence.  But we can, at least, affirm \ntheir basic nature and create an atmosphere where pe ople can seize opportunities and solve problems in \nan increasingly self-reliant way.  Act or be Acted Upon     The difference between people who exercise initia tive and those who don't is  literally the difference \nbetween night and day.  I'm not talking about a 25 to  50 percent difference in effectiveness; I'm talking \nabout a 5000-plus percent difference, particularly if they are smart, aware, and sensitive to others. \n   It takes initiative to create the P/PC Balance of effectiveness in",

    "text": "abilities can help solve the organization's problem.  It 's called \"solution selling,\" and is a key paradigm \nin business success.    The response is usually agreement -- most pe ople can see how powerfully such an approach would \naffect their opportunities for employment or adva ncement.  But many of them fail to take the \nnecessary steps, the initiative, to make it happen.    \"I don't know where to go to ta ke the interest and aptitude test.\" \n   \"How do I study industry and organizat ional problems? No one wants to help me.\" \n   Many people wait for something to happen or so meone to take care of them.  But people who end \nup with the good jobs are the proactive ones who are solutions to problems, not problems themselves, \nwho seize the initiative to do whatever is necessary , consistent with correct principles, to get the job \ndone.    Whenever someone in our family, even one of th e younger children, takes an irresponsible position \nand waits for someone else to make things happen or  provide a solution, we tell them, \"Use your R and \nI!\" (resourcefulness and initiative).  In fact, often before we can say it, they answer",

It takes initiative to \ndevelop the Seven Habits.  As you study the other six habits, you will see that each depends on the \ndevelopment of your proactive muscles.  Each puts the responsibility on you to act.  If you wait to be \nacted upon, you will be acted upon.  And growth an d opportunity consequences attend either road. \n   At one time I worked with a group of people  in the home improvement industry, representatives \nfrom 20 different organizations who met quarterly  to share their numbers and problems in an \nuninhibited way.    This was during a time of heavy recession, and the negative impact on this particular industry was \neven heavier than on the economy in general.  These people were fairly discouraged as we began. \n   The first day, our discussion question was \"Wha t's happening to us? What's the stimulus?\" Many \nthings were happening.  The environmental pr essures were powerful.  There was widespread \nunemployment, and many of these people were laying off friends just to maintain the viability of their \nenterprises.

At the every end of the thir d day, we summarized the results of the conference in a three-part \nanswer to the question, \"How's business?\"    Part one: What's happening to us is not good, an d the trends suggest that it  will get worse before it \ngets better    Part two: But what we are causing to happen is  very good, for we are better managing and reducing \nour costs and increasing our market share    Part three: Therefore, business is better than ever    Now what would a reactive mind say to that? \"Oh , come on.  Face facts.  You can only carry this \npositive thinking and self-psych approach so f ar.  Sooner or later you have to face reality.\" \n   But that's the difference between positive thinking  and proactivity.  We did face reality.  We faced \nthe reality of the current circumstance and of future projections.  But we also faced the reality that we \nhad the power to choose a positive response to those circumstances and projections.  Not facing reality \nwould have been to accept the idea that what's happening in our environm ent had to determine us. \n   Businesses, community groups, organizations of ev ery kind -- including families -- can be proactive.  \nThey can combine the creativity and resourcefulness of proactive individuals to create a proactive \nculture within the organization.  The organization does  not have to be at the mercy of the environment; \nit can take the initiative to accomplish the shared values and purposes of the individuals involved. \n Listening to our Language     Because our attitudes and behaviors flow out of our paradigms, if we us e our self-awareness to \nexamine them, we can often see in them the nature  of our underlying maps.  Our language, for \nexample, is a very real indicator of the degr ee to which we see ourselves as proactive people. \n   The language of reactive people  absolves them of  responsibility. \n   \"That's me.  That's just the way I am.\" I am  determined.  There's nothing I can do about it. \n   \"He makes me so mad!\" I'm not responsible.  My  emotional life is governed by something outside \nmy control.    \"I can't do that.  I just don't have the time.\"  Something outside me -- limited time -- is controlling \nme.    \"If only my wife were more patient.\" Someon e else's behavior is limiting my effectiveness. \n   \"I have to do it.\" Circumstan ces or other people are forcing me to do what I do.  I'm not free to \nchoose my own actions.    Reactive Language: There's nothing I can do.   That's just the way I am.  He makes me so mad.  \nThey won't allow that.  I have to do that.  I can't.  I must.  If only. \n   Proactive Language:  Let's look at our alternat ives.  I can choose a different approach.  I control \nmy own feelings.  I can create an effective presen tation.  I will choose an appropriate response.  I \nchoose.  I prefer.  I will.    That language comes from a basic paradigm of determinism.  And the whole spirit of it is the \ntransfer of responsibility.  I am not resp onsible, not able to choose my response. \n   One time a student asked me, \"Will you excuse me from class? I have to go on a tennis trip.\" \n   \"You have to go, or you choose to go?\" I asked.    \"I really have to,\" he exclaimed. \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n   \"What will happen if you don't?\" \n   \"Why, they'll kick me off the team.\"    \"How would you like that consequence?\"    \"I wouldn't.\"    \"In other words, you choose to go because you wa nt the consequence of stay ing on the team.  What \nwill happen if you miss my class?\"    \"I don't know.\"    \"Think hard.  What do you think would be the natural consequence of not coming to class?\" \n   \"You wouldn't kick me out, would you?\"    \"That would be a social consequence.  That wo uld be artificial.  If you don't participate on the \ntennis team, you don't play.  That's natural.  But",

At the every end of the thir d day, we summarized the results of the conference in a three-part \nanswer to the question, \"How's business?\"    Part one: What's happening to us is not good, an d the trends suggest that it  will get worse before it \ngets better    Part two: But what we are causing to happen is  very good, for we are better managing and reducing \nour costs and increasing our market share    Part three: Therefore, business is better than ever    Now what would a reactive mind say to that? \"Oh , come on.  Face facts.  You can only carry this \npositive thinking and self-psych approach so f ar.  Sooner or later you have to face reality.\" \n   But that's the difference between positive thinking  and proactivity.  We did face reality.  We faced \nthe reality of the current circumstance and of future projections.  But we also faced the reality that we \nhad the power to choose a positive response to those circumstances and projections.  Not facing reality \nwould have been to accept the idea that what's happening in our environm ent had to determine us. \n   Businesses, community groups, organizations of ev ery kind -- including families -- can be proactive.  \nThey can combine the creativity and resourcefulness of proactive individuals to create a proactive \nculture within the organization.  The organization does  not have to be at the mercy of the environment; \nit can take the initiative to accomplish the shared values and purposes of the individuals involved. \n Listening to our Language     Because our attitudes and behaviors flow out of our paradigms, if we us e our self-awareness to \nexamine them, we can often see in them the nature  of our underlying maps.  Our language, for \nexample, is a very real indicator of the degr ee to which we see ourselves as proactive people. \n   The language of reactive people  absolves them of  responsibility. \n   \"That's me.  That's just the way I am.\" I am  determined.  There's nothing I can do about it. \n   \"He makes me so mad!\" I'm not responsible.  My  emotional life is governed by something outside \nmy control.    \"I can't do that.  I just don't have the time",

Face facts.  You can only carry this \npositive thinking and self-psych approach so f ar.  Sooner or later you have to face reality.\" \n   But that's the difference between positive thinking  and proactivity.  We did face reality.

But we also faced the reality that we \nhad the power to choose a positive response to those circumstances and projections.  Not facing reality \nwould have been to accept the idea that what's happening in our environm ent had to determine us. \n   Businesses, community groups, organizations of ev ery kind -- including families -- can be proactive.  \nThey can combine the creativity and resourcefulness of proactive individuals to create a proactive \nculture within the organization.  The organization does  not have to be at the mercy of the environment; \nit can take the initiative to accomplish the shared values and purposes of the individuals involved. \n Listening to our Language     Because our attitudes and behaviors flow out of our paradigms, if we us e our self-awareness to \nexamine them, we can often see in them the nature  of our underlying maps.  Our language, for \nexample, is a very real indicator of the degr ee to which we see ourselves as proactive people. \n   The language of reactive people  absolves them of  responsibility. \n   \"That's me.  That's just the way I am.\" I am  determined.  There's nothing",

    "text": "'t kick me out, would you?\"    \"That would be a social consequence.  That wo uld be artificial.  If you don't participate on the \ntennis team, you don't play.  That's natural.  But if you don't come to class, what would be the natural \nconsequence?\"    \"I guess I'll miss the learning.\"    \"That's right.  So you have to weigh that consequence against the other consequence and make a \nchoice.  I know if it were me, I'd choose to go on  the tennis trip.  But never say you have to do \nanything.\"    \"I choose to go on the tennis trip,\" he meekly replied.    \"And miss my class?\" I replied in mock disbelief.    A serious problem with reactive language is that it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.  People \nbecome reinforced in the paradigm that they are de termined, and they produce evidence to support the \nbelief.  They feel increasingly victimized and out of control, not in charge of th eir life or their destiny.  \nThey blame outside forces -- other people, circumst ances, even the stars -- for their own situation. \n   At one seminar where I was speaking on the concept of proactivity, a man came up and said, \n\"Stephen, I like what you're saying.  But every situat ion is so different.  Look at my marriage.  I'm \nreally worried.  My wife and I just don't have th e same feelings for each other we used to have.  I \nguess I just don't love her anymore and she doesn't love me.  What can I do?\" \n   \"The feeling isn't there anymore?\" I asked.    \"That's right,\" he reaffirmed.  \"And we have th ree children we're really concerned about.  What do \nyou suggest?\"    \"Love her,\" I replied.    \"I told you, the feeling just isn't there anymore.\"    \"Love her.\"    \"You don't understand.  The f eeling of love just isn't there.\" \n   \"Then love her.  If the feeling isn't th ere, that's a good reason to love her.\" \n   \"But how do you love when you don't love?\"    \"My friend, love is a verb.  Love -- the feeling -- is a fruit of love the verb.  So love her.  Sacrifice.  Listen to her.  Empathize.  Appreciate.  Affirm her.  Are you willing to do that?\" \n   In the great literature of all progressive societies, love is a verb.  Reactive people make it a feeling.  \nThey're driven by feelings.  Hollywood has generally scripted us to believe that we are not responsible, \nthat we are a product of our feelin gs.  But the Hollywood script does not describe the reality.  If our \nfeelings control our actions, it is because we have  abdicated our responsibility and empowered them to \ndo so.    Proactive people make love a verb.  Love is something you do: the sacrifices you make, the giving \nof self, like a mother bringing a newborn into the wo rld.  If you want to study love, study those who \nsacrifice for others, even for people who offend or do not love in return.  If you are a parent, look at the \nlove you have for the children you sacrificed for.  Lo ve is a value that is actualized through loving \nactions.  Proactive people subordinate feelings to  values.  Love, the feeling, can be recaptured. \n \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \nCircle of Concern. Circle of Influence. \n    Another excellent way to become more self-aware  regarding our own degree of proactivity is to look \nat where we focus our time and energy.  We each have a wide range of concerns -- our health, our \nchildren, problems at work, the national debt, nucl ear war.  We could separate those from things in \nwhich we have no particular mental or emotional involvement by creating a \"Circle of Concern. \n   As we look at those things within our Circle of  Concern, it becomes apparent that there are some \nthings over which we have no real control and ot hers that we can do something about.  We could \nidentify those concerns in the latter group by circumsc ribing them within a smaller Circle of Influence.  \nBy determining which of these two circles is the focu s of most of our time and energy, we can discover \n",

But if you don't come to class, what would be the natural \nconsequence?\"    \"I guess I'll miss the learning.\"    \"That's right.  So you have to weigh that consequence against the other consequence and make a \nchoice.  I know if it were me, I'd choose to go on  the tennis trip.  But never say you have to do \nanything.\"    \"I choose to go on the tennis trip,\" he meekly replied.    \"And miss my class?\" I replied in mock disbelief.    A serious problem with reactive language is that it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.  People \nbecome reinforced in the paradigm that they are de termined, and they produce evidence to support the \nbelief.  They feel increasingly victimized and out of control, not in charge of th eir life or their destiny.  \nThey blame outside forces -- other people, circumst ances, even the stars -- for their own situation. \n   At one seminar where I was speaking on the concept of proactivity, a man came up and said, \n\"Stephen, I like what you're saying.  But every situat ion is so different.  Look at my marriage.  I'm \nreally worried.  My wife and I just don't have th e same feelings for each other we used to have.  I \nguess I just don't love her anymore and she doesn't love me.  What can I do?\" \n   \"The feeling isn't there anymore?\" I asked.    \"That's right,\" he reaffirmed.  \"And we have th ree children we're really concerned about.  What do \nyou suggest?\"    \"Love her,\" I replied.    \"I told you, the feeling just isn't there anymore.\"    \"Love her.\"    \"You don't understand.  The f eeling of love just isn't there.\" \n   \"Then love her.  If the feeling isn't th ere, that's a good reason to love her.\" \n   \"But how do you love when you don't love?\"    \"My friend, love is a verb.  Love -- the feeling -- is a fruit of love the verb.  So love her",

    "text": "'s a good reason to love her.\" \n   \"But how do you love when you don't love?\"    \"My friend, love is a verb.  Love -- the feeling -- is a fruit of love the verb.  So love her.  Sacrifice.  Listen to her.  Empathize.  Appreciate.  Affirm her.  Are you willing to do that?\" \n   In the great literature of all progressive societies, love is a verb.  Reactive people make it a feeling.  \nThey're driven by feelings.  Hollywood has generally scripted us to believe that we are not responsible, \nthat we are a product of our feelin gs.  But the Hollywood script does not describe the reality.  If our \nfeelings control our actions, it is because we have  abdicated our responsibility and empowered them to \ndo so.    Proactive people make love a verb.  Love is something you do: the sacrifices you make, the giving \nof self, like a mother bringing a newborn into the wo rld.  If you want to study love, study those who \nsacrifice for others, even for people who offend or do not love in return.  If you are a parent, look at the \nlove you have for the children you sacrificed for.  Lo ve is a value that is actualized through loving \nactions.  Proactive people subordinate feelings to  values.  Love, the feeling, can be recaptured. \n \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \nCircle of Concern. Circle of Influence. \n    Another excellent way to become more self-aware  regarding our own degree of proactivity is to look \nat where we focus our time and energy.  We each have a wide range of concerns -- our health, our \nchildren, problems at work, the national debt, nucl ear war.  We could separate those from things in \nwhich we have no particular mental or emotional involvement by creating a \"Circle of Concern. \n   As we look at those things within our Circle of  Concern, it becomes apparent that there are some \nthings over which we have no real control and ot hers that we can do something about",

    "text": ".  We could \nidentify those concerns in the latter group by circumsc ribing them within a smaller Circle of Influence.  \nBy determining which of these two circles is the focu s of most of our time and energy, we can discover \nmuch about the degree of our proactivity.    Proactive people focus their efforts in the Circle of Influence.  They work on the things they can do \nsomething about.  The nature of their energy is positive, enlarging and ma gnifying, causing their \nCircle of Influence to increase.    Reactive people, on the other hand, focus their e fforts in the Circle of Concern.  They focus on the \nweakness of other people, the problems in the envi ronment, and circumstances over which they have \nno control.  Their focus results in blaming and accusing attitudes,  reactive language, and increased \nfeelings of victimization.  The negative energy generat ed by that focus, combined with neglect in areas \nthey could do something about, causes their Circle of Influence to shrink. \n   As long as we are working in ou r Circle of Concern, we empower the things within it to control us.  \nWe aren't taking the proactive initiative necessary to effect positive change.    Earlier, I shared with you the story of my son who was having serious problems in school.  Sandra \nand I were deeply concerned about his apparent weaknesses and about the way other people were \ntreating him.    But those things were in our Circle of Concern.  As long as we focused our efforts on those things, \nwe accomplished nothing, except to increase our ow n feelings of inadequacy  and helplessness and to \nreinforce our son's dependence.    It was only when we went to work in our Ci rcle of Influence, when we focused on our own \nparadigms, that we began to create a positive energy that changed ourselves and eventually influenced \nour son as well.  By working on ourselves inst ead of worrying about cond itions, we were able to \ninfluence the conditions.    Because of position, wealth, role, or relationship s, there are some circumst ances in which a person's \nCircle of Influence is larger than  his or her Circle of Concern. \n   This situation reflects on a self-inflicted emot ional myopia -- another re active selfish life-style \nfocused in the Circle of Concern.    Though they may have to prioritize the use of their influence, proactive people have a Circle of \nConcern that is at least as big as their Circle of  Influence, accepting the responsibility to use their \ninfluence effectively.  Direct, Indirect, and No Control     The problems we face fall in one of three areas: direct control (problems involving our own \nbehavior); indirect control (problems involving other people's behavior); or no control (problems we can \ndo nothing about, such as our past or situational re alities).  The proactive approach puts the first step \nin the solution of all three kinds of proble ms within our present Circle of Influence. \n    Direct control problems are solved by working on  our habits.  They are obviously within our Circle \nof Influence.  These are the \"Private Victories\" of Habits 1, 2, and 3. \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n   Indirect control problems are solved by changi ng our methods of influence.  These are the \"Public \nVictories\" of Habits 4, 5, and 6.  I have persona lly identified over 30 separate methods of human \ninfluence -- as separate as empathy is from confront ation, as separate as example is from persuasion.  \nM o s t  p e o p l e  h a v e  o n l y  t h r e e  o r  f o u r  o f  t h e s e  methods in their repertoire, starting usually with \nreasoning, and, if that doesn't work, moving to flight  or fight.  How liberating it is to accept the idea \nthat I can learn new methods of human influence inst ead of constantly trying to use old ineffective \nmethods to \"shape up\" someone else!    No control problems involve taking the responsib ility to change the line on the bottom on our face -- \nto smile, to genuinely and peacefully  accept these problems and learn to live with them, even though \nwe don't like them.  In this way, we do not empower these problems to control us.  We share in the \nspirit embodied in the Alcoholics Anonymous prayer, \"Lord, give me",

We could \nidentify those concerns in the latter group by circumsc ribing them within a smaller Circle of Influence.  \nBy determining which of these two circles is the focu s of most of our time and energy, we can discover \nmuch about the degree of our proactivity.    Proactive people focus their efforts in the Circle of Influence.  They work on the things they can do \nsomething about.  The nature of their energy is positive, enlarging and ma gnifying, causing their \nCircle of Influence to increase.    Reactive people, on the other hand, focus their e fforts in the Circle of Concern.  They focus on the \nweakness of other people, the problems in the envi ronment, and circumstances over which they have \nno control.  Their focus results in blaming and accusing attitudes,  reactive language, and increased \nfeelings of victimization.  The negative energy generat ed by that focus, combined with neglect in areas \nthey could do something about, causes their Circle of Influence to shrink. \n   As long as we are working in ou r Circle of Concern, we empower the things within it to control us.  \nWe aren't taking the proactive initiative necessary to effect positive change.    Earlier, I shared with you the story of my son who was having serious problems in school.  Sandra \nand I were deeply concerned about his apparent weaknesses and about the way other people were \ntreating him.    But those things were in our Circle of Concern.  As long as we focused our efforts on those things, \nwe accomplished nothing, except to increase our ow n feelings of inadequacy  and helplessness and to \nreinforce our son's dependence.    It was only when we went to work in our Ci rcle of Influence, when we focused on our own \nparadigms, that we began to create a positive energy that changed ourselves and eventually influenced \nour son as well.  By working on ourselves inst ead of worrying about cond itions, we were able to \ninfluence the conditions.    Because of position, wealth, role, or relationship s, there are some circumst ances in which a person's \nCircle of Influence is larger than  his or her Circle of Concern. \n   This situation reflects on a self-inflicted emot ional myopia -- another re active selfish life-style \nfocused in the Circle of Concern.    Though they may have to prioritize the use of their influence, proactive people",

We could \nidentify those concerns in the latter group by circumsc ribing them within a smaller Circle of Influence.  \nBy determining which of these two circles is the focu s of most of our time and energy, we can discover \nmuch about the degree of our proactivity.    Proactive people focus their efforts in the Circle of Influence.  They work on the things they can do \nsomething about.  The nature of their energy is positive, enlarging and ma gnifying, causing their \nCircle of Influence to increase.    Reactive people, on the other hand, focus their e fforts in the Circle of Concern.  They focus on the \nweakness of other people, the problems in the envi ronment, and circumstances over which they have \nno control.  Their focus results in blaming and accusing attitudes,  reactive language, and increased \nfeelings of victimization.  The negative energy generat ed by that focus, combined with neglect in areas \nthey could do something about, causes their Circle of Influence to shrink. \n   As long as we are working in ou r Circle of Concern, we empower the things within it to control us.  \nWe aren't taking the proactive initiative necessary to effect positive change.

    "text": " her Circle of Concern. \n   This situation reflects on a self-inflicted emot ional myopia -- another re active selfish life-style \nfocused in the Circle of Concern.    Though they may have to prioritize the use of their influence, proactive people have a Circle of \nConcern that is at least as big as their Circle of  Influence, accepting the responsibility to use their \ninfluence effectively.  Direct, Indirect, and No Control     The problems we face fall in one of three areas: direct control (problems involving our own \nbehavior); indirect control (problems involving other people's behavior); or no control (problems we can \ndo nothing about, such as our past or situational re alities).  The proactive approach puts the first step \nin the solution of all three kinds of proble ms within our present Circle of Influence. \n    Direct control problems are solved by working on  our habits.  They are obviously within our Circle \nof Influence.

Though they may have to prioritize the use of their influence, proactive people have a Circle of \nConcern that is at least as big as their Circle of  Influence, accepting the responsibility to use their \ninfluence effectively.  Direct, Indirect, and No Control     The problems we face fall in one of three areas: direct control (problems involving our own \nbehavior); indirect control (problems involving other people's behavior); or no control (problems we can \ndo nothing about, such as our past or situational re alities).  The proactive approach puts the first step \nin the solution of all three kinds of proble ms within our present Circle of Influence. \n    Direct control problems are solved by working on  our habits.  They are obviously within our Circle \nof Influence.  These are the \"Private Victories\" of Habits 1, 2, and 3. \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P",

We share in the \nspirit embodied in the Alcoholics Anonymous prayer, \"Lord, give me the courage to change the things \nwhich can and ought to be changed, the serenity to accept the things which cannot be changed, and the \nwisdom to know the difference.\"    Whether a problem is direct, indirect, or no co ntrol, we have in our hands the first step to the \nsolution.  Changing our habits, changing our methods of influenc e and changing the way we see our \nno control problems are all with in our Circle of Influence. \n Expanding the Circle of Influence     It is inspiring to realize that in choosing ou r response to circumstance, we powerfully affect our \ncircumstance.  When we change one part of the chemical formula, we ch ange the nature of the results \n   I worked with one organization for several years  that was headed by a very dynamic person.  He \ncould read trends.  He was creative, talented, capable, and brilliant -- and everyone knew it.  But he had a very dictatorial style of management.  He tended  to treat people like \"gofers,\" as if they didn't \nhave any judgment.  His manner of speaking to those who worked in the organization was, \"Go for \nthis; go for that; now do this; now do that -- I'll make the decisions. \n   The net effect was that he alienated almost the entire executive team surro unding him.  They would \ngather in the corridors and complain to each other about him.  Their discussion was all very \nsophisticated, very articulate, as if they were trying  to help the situation.  But they did it endlessly, \nabsolving themselves of responsibility in the name of the president's weaknesses. \n   \"You can't imagine what's happened this time,\" someone would say.  \"The other day he went into \nmy department.  I had everything all laid out.  But he came in and gave totally different signals.  Everything I'd done for months was shot,  just lik e that.  I don't know how I'm supposed to keep \nworking for him.  How long will it be until he retires?\"    \"He's only fifty-nine,\" someone else would re spond.  \"Do you think you can survive for six more \nyears?\"    \"I don't know.  He's the kind of pe rson they probably won't retire anyway.\" \n   But one of the executives was proactive.  He was driven by values, not feelings.  He took initiative \n-- he anticipated, he empathized, he read the situatio n.  He was not blind to the president's weaknesses; \nbut instead of criticizing them, he would compensa te for them.  Where the president was weak in his \nstyle, he'd try to buffer his own people and make su ch weaknesses irrelevant.  And he'd work with the \npresident's strengths -- his vision, talent, creativity.    This man focused on his Circle of Influence.  He was treated like a gofer, also.  But he would do \nmore than what was expected.  He anticipated th e president's need.  He read with empathy the \npresident's underlying concern, so when he presente d information, he also gave his analysis and his \nrecommendations based on that analysis.    As I sat one day with the president in an adviso ry capacity, he said, \"Stephen, I just can't believe \nwhat this man has done.  He's not only given me  the information I requested, but he's provided \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \nadditional information that's exactl y what we needed.  He even gave me  his analysis of it in terms of \nmy deepest concerns, and a list of his recommendations.    \"The recommendations are consistent with the anal ysis, and the analysis is consistent with the data.  \nHe's remarkable! What a relief not to have to worry about this part of the business.\" \n   At the next meeting, it was \"go for this\" and \"go fo r that\" to all the executives but one.  To this man, \nit was \"What's your opinion?\" His Circle of Influence had grown    This caused quite a stir in the organization.  The reactive minds in the executive corridors began \nshooting their vindictive ammuni tion at this proactive man. \n   It's the nature of reactive people",

We share in the \nspirit embodied in the Alcoholics Anonymous prayer, \"Lord, give me the courage to change the things \nwhich can and ought to be changed, the serenity to accept the things which cannot be changed, and the \nwisdom to know the difference.\"    Whether a problem is direct, indirect, or no co ntrol, we have in our hands the first step to the \nsolution.

He \ncould read trends.  He was creative, talented, capable, and brilliant -- and everyone knew it.  But he had a very dictatorial style of management.  He tended  to treat people like \"gofers,\" as if they didn't \nhave any judgment.  His manner of speaking to those who worked in the organization was, \"Go for \nthis; go for that; now do this; now do that -- I'll make the decisions. \n   The net effect was that he alienated almost the entire executive team surro unding him.  They would \ngather in the corridors and complain to each other about him.  Their discussion was all very \nsophisticated, very articulate, as if they were trying  to help the situation.  But they did it endlessly, \nabsolving themselves of responsibility in the name of the president's weaknesses. \n   \"You can't imagine what's happened this time,\" someone would say.  \"The other day he went into \nmy department.  I had everything all laid out.  But he came in and gave totally different signals.  Everything I'd done for months was shot,  just lik e that.  I don't know how I'm supposed to keep \nworking for him.  How long will it be until he retires?\"    \"He's only fifty-nine,\" someone else would re spond.  \"Do you think you",

How long will it be until he retires?\"    \"He's only fifty-nine,\" someone else would re spond.  \"Do you think you can survive for six more \nyears?\"    \"I don't know.  He's the kind of pe rson they probably won't retire anyway.\" \n   But one of the executives was proactive.  He was driven by values, not feelings.  He took initiative \n-- he anticipated, he empathized, he read the situatio n.  He was not blind to the president's weaknesses; \nbut instead of criticizing them, he would compensa te for them.  Where the president was weak in his \nstyle, he'd try to buffer his own people and make su ch weaknesses irrelevant.  And he'd work with the \npresident's strengths -- his vision, talent, creativity.    This man focused on his Circle of Influence.  He was treated like a gofer, also.  But he would do \nmore than what was expected.  He anticipated th e president's need.  He read with empathy the \npresident's underlying concern, so when he presente d information, he also gave his analysis and his \nrecommendations based on that analysis.    As I sat one day with the president in an adviso ry capacity, he said, \"Stephen, I just can't believe \nwhat this man has done.  He's not only given me  the information I requested, but he's provided \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \nadditional information that's exactl y what we needed.  He even gave me  his analysis of it in terms of \nmy deepest concerns, and a list of his recommendations.    \"The recommendations are consistent with the anal ysis, and the analysis is consistent with the data.  \nHe's remarkable! What a relief not to have to worry about this part of the business.\" \n   At the next meeting, it was \"go for this\" and \"go fo r that\" to all the executives but one.  To this man, \nit was \"What's your opinion?\"",

    "text": " His Circle of Influence had grown    This caused quite a stir in the organization.  The reactive minds in the executive corridors began \nshooting their vindictive ammuni tion at this proactive man. \n   It's the nature of reactive people to absolve themse lves of responsibility.  It's  so much safer to say, \"I \nam not responsible.\" If I say \"I am responsible,\" I mi ght have to say, \"I am irresponsible.\" It would be \nvery hard for me to say that I have the power to  choose my response and that the response I have \nchosen has resulted in my involvement in a negative , collusive environment, especially if for years I \nhave absolved myself of responsibility for resu lts in the name of someone else's weaknesses. \n   So these executives focused on finding more in formation, more ammunition, more evidence as to \nwhy they weren't responsible.    But this man was proactive toward them, too.  Little by little, his Circle of Influence toward them grew also.  It continued to expand to the extent th at eventually no one made any significant moves in \nthe organization without that man's involvement an d approval, including the president.  But the \npresident did not feel threatened because this man's strength complemented his strength and \ncompensated for his weaknesses.  So he had the strength of two people, a complementary team. \n   This man's success was not dependent on his circumstances.  Many others were in the same \nsituation.  It was his chosen response to those circum stances, his focus on his Ci rcle of Influence, that \nmade the difference.    There are some people who interpret \"proactive\" to  mean pushy, aggressive, or insensitive; but that \nisn't the case at all.  Proactive people aren't push y.  They're smart, they're value driven, they read \nreality, and they know what's needed.    Look at Gandhi.  While his accusers were in the legislative chambers criticizing him because he \nwouldn't join in their Circle of Concern rhetoric co ndemning the British Empire for their subjugation of \nthe Indian people, Gandhi was out in the rice pa ddies, quietly, slowly, imperceptibly expanding his \nCircle of Influence with the field laborers.  A ground  swell of support, of trust, of confidence followed \nhim through the countryside.  Though he held no office or political posi tion, through compassion, \ncourage, fasting, and moral persua sion he eventually brought England to its knees, breaking political \ndomination of 300 million people with the power of  his greatly expanded Circle of Influence. \n The \"Have's\" and the \"Be's\"     One wa\ny to determine which circle our concern is in is to distin guish between the have 's and the be's.  \nThe Circle of Concern is filled with the have's    \"I'll be happy when I have my house paid off.\"    \" I f  o n l y  I  h a d  a  b o s s  w h o wasn't such a dictator.\" \n   \"If only I had a more patient husband.\"    \"If I had more obedient kids.\"    \"If I had my degree.\"    \"If I could just have more time to myself.\"    The Circle of Influence is filled with the be's -- I can be more patient, be wise, be loving.  It's the \ncharacter focus.    Anytime we think the problem is \"out there,\" that  thought is the problem.  We empower what's out \nthere to control us.  The change paradigm is \"outside -in\" -- what's out there ha s to change before we \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \ncan change. \n   The proactive approach is to change from the In side-Out: to be different, and by being different, to \neffect positive change in what's out there -- I can be  more resourceful, I can be more diligent, I can be \nmore creative, I can be more cooperative.

    "text": " His Circle of Influence had grown    This caused quite a stir in the organization.  The reactive minds in the executive corridors began \nshooting their vindictive ammuni tion at this proactive man. \n   It's the nature of reactive people to absolve themse lves of responsibility.  It's  so much safer to say, \"I \nam not responsible.\" If I say \"I am responsible,\" I mi ght have to say, \"I am irresponsible.\" It would be \nvery hard for me to say that I have the power to  choose my response and that the response I have \nchosen has resulted in my involvement in a negative , collusive environment, especially if for years I \nhave absolved myself of responsibility for resu lts in the name of someone else's weaknesses. \n   So these executives focused on finding more in formation, more ammunition, more evidence as to \nwhy they weren't responsible.    But this man was proactive toward them, too.  Little by little, his Circle of Influence toward them grew also.  It continued to expand to the extent th at eventually no one made any significant moves in \nthe organization without that man's involvement an d approval, including the president.  But the \npresident did not feel threatened because this man's strength complemented his strength and \ncompensated for his weaknesses.  So he had the strength of two people, a complementary team. \n   This man's success was not dependent on his circumstances.  Many others were in the same \nsituation.  It was his chosen response to those circum stances, his focus on his Ci rcle of Influence, that \nmade the difference.    There are some people who interpret \"proactive\" to  mean pushy, aggressive, or insensitive; but that \nisn't the case at all.  Proactive people aren't push y.  They're smart, they're value driven, they read \nreality, and they know what's needed.    Look at Gandhi.  While his accusers were in the legislative chambers criticizing him because he \nwouldn't join in their Circle of Concern rhetoric co ndemning the British Empire for their subjugation of \nthe Indian people, Gandhi was out in the rice pa ddies, quietly, slowly, imperceptibly expanding his \nCircle of Influence with the field laborers.  A ground  swell of support, of trust, of confidence followed \nhim through the countryside.  Though he held no office",

It's  so much safer to say, \"I \nam not responsible.\" If I say \"I am responsible,\" I mi ght have to say, \"I am irresponsible.\" It would be \nvery hard for me to say that I have the power to  choose my response and that the response I have \nchosen has resulted in my involvement in a negative , collusive environment, especially if for years I \nhave absolved myself of responsibility for resu lts in the name of someone else's weaknesses. \n   So these executives focused on finding more in formation, more ammunition, more evidence as to \nwhy they weren't responsible.    But this man was proactive toward them, too.  Little by little, his Circle of Influence toward them grew also.  It continued to expand to the extent th at eventually no one made any significant moves in \nthe organization without that man's involvement an d approval, including the president.

It's the story of Joseph, who was sold into slavery in Egypt by his brothers \nat the age of 17.  Can you imagine how easy it would have been for him to languish in self-pity as a \nservant of Potiphar, to focus on the weaknesses of his brothers and his ca ptors and on all he didn't have? \nBut Joseph was proactive.  He worked on be.  An d within a short period of time, he was running \nPotiphar's household.  He was in charge of all that Potiphar had because the trust was so high. \n   Then the day came when Joseph was caught in a difficult situation and refused to compromise his \nintegrity.  As a result, he was unjustly imprisoned  for 13 years.  But again he was proactive.  He \nworked on the inner circle, on being instead of having, and soon he was running the prison and \neventually the entire nation of Eg ypt, second only to the Pharaoh. \n   I know this idea is a dramatic  Paradigm Shift for many people.  It is so much easier to blame other \npeople, conditioning, or conditions for our own stagnant situation.  But we are responsible -- \n\"response-able\" -- to control our lives and to powerful ly influence our circumstances by working on be, \non what we are.    If I have a problem in my marriage, what do I re ally gain by continually co nfessing my wife's sins? \nBy saying I'm not responsible, I make myself a powerless victim; I immobilize myself in a negative \nsituation.  I also diminish my ability to influence her -- my nagging, accusing, critical attitude only \nmakes her feel validated in her own weakness.  My  criticism is worse than the conduct I want to \ncorrect.  My ability to positively im pact the situation withers and dies. \n   If I really want to improve my situation, I ca n work on the one thing over which I have control -- \nmyself.  I can stop trying to shap e up my wife and work on my own weaknesses.  I can focus on being \na great marriage partner, a source of unconditional love and support.  Hopefully , my wife will feel the \npower of proactive example and respond in kind.  Bu t whether she does or doesn't, the most positive \nway I can influence my situation is to work on myself, on my being. \n   There are so many ways to work in the Circle of Influence -- to be a better listener, to be a more \nloving marriage partner, to be a better student, to  be a more cooperative and dedicated employee.  \nSometimes the most proactive thing we can do is to be happy, just to genuinely smile.  Happiness, like \nunhappiness, is a proactive choice.  There are things, like the weather, th at our Circle of Influence will \nnever include.  But as proactive people, we can carry our own physical or social weather with us.  We \ncan be happy and accept those things that at presen t we can't control, while we focus our efforts on the \nthings that we can.  The Other End of the Stick     Before we totally shift our life focus to our Circle of Influence, we need to consider two things in our \nCircle of Concern that merit deeper thought -- consequences and mistakes. \n   While we are free to choose our actions, we are not free to choose the consequences of those actions.  \nConsequences are governed by natural law.  They are out in the Circle of Conc ern.  We can decide to \nstep in front of a fast-moving train, but we canno t decide what will happen when the train hits us. \n   We can decide to be dishonest in our business dealings.  While the social consequences of that \ndecision may vary depending on whether or not we are found out, the natural consequences to our \nbasic character are a fixed result.    Our behavior is governed by principles.  Living in harmony with them brings positive consequences; violating them brings negative conseq uences.  We are free to choose our response in any \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \nsituation, but in doing so, we choose the attendant consequence.  \"When we pick up one end of the \nstick, we pick up the other.\"    Undoubtedly, there have been",

It's the story of Joseph, who was sold into slavery in Egypt by his brothers \nat the age of 17.  Can you imagine how easy it would have been for him to languish in self-pity as a \nservant of Potiphar, to focus on the weaknesses of his brothers and his ca ptors and on all he didn't have? \nBut Joseph was proactive.  He worked on be.  An d within a short period of time, he was running \nPotiphar's household.  He was in charge of all that Potiphar had because the trust was so high. \n   Then the day came when Joseph was caught in a difficult situation and refused to compromise his \nintegrity.  As a result, he was unjustly imprisoned  for 13 years.  But again he was proactive.  He \nworked on the inner circle, on being instead of having, and soon he was running the prison and \neventually the entire nation of Eg ypt, second only to the Pharaoh. \n   I know this idea is a dramatic  Paradigm Shift for many people.  It is so much easier to blame other \npeople, conditioning, or conditions for our own stagnant situation.  But we are responsible -- \n\"response-able\" -- to control our lives and to powerful ly influence our circumstances by working on be, \non what we are.    If I have a problem in my marriage, what do I re ally gain by continually co nfessing my wife's sins? \nBy saying I'm not responsible, I make myself a powerless victim; I immobilize myself in a negative \nsituation.  I also diminish my ability to influence her -- my nagging, accusing, critical attitude only \nmakes her feel validated in her own weakness.  My  criticism is worse than the conduct I want to \ncorrect.  My ability to positively im pact the situation withers and dies. \n   If I really want to improve my situation, I ca n work on the one thing over which I have control -- \nmyself.  I can stop trying to shap e up my wife and work on my own weaknesses.  I can focus on being \na great marriage partner, a source of unconditional love and",

It's the story of Joseph, who was sold into slavery in Egypt by his brothers \nat the age of 17.  Can you imagine how easy it would have been for him to languish in self-pity as a \nservant of Potiphar, to focus on the weaknesses of his brothers and his ca ptors and on all he didn't have? \nBut Joseph was proactive.

He was in charge of all that Potiphar had because the trust was so high. \n   Then the day came when Joseph was caught in a difficult situation and refused to compromise his \nintegrity.  As a result, he was unjustly imprisoned  for 13 years.  But again he was proactive.  He \nworked on the inner circle, on being instead of having, and soon he was running the prison and \neventually the entire nation of Eg ypt, second only",

I can focus on being \na great marriage partner, a source of unconditional love and support.  Hopefully , my wife will feel the \npower of proactive example and respond in kind.  Bu t whether she does or doesn't, the most positive \nway I can influence my situation is to work on myself, on my being. \n   There are so many ways to work in the Circle of Influence -- to be a better listener, to be a more \nloving marriage partner, to be a better student, to  be a more cooperative and dedicated employee.  \nSometimes the most proactive thing we can do is to be happy, just to genuinely smile.  Happiness, like \nunhappiness, is a proactive choice.  There are things, like the weather, th at our Circle of Influence will \nnever include.  But as proactive people, we can carry our own physical or social weather with us.  We \ncan be happy and accept those things that at presen t we can't control, while we focus our efforts on the \nthings that we can.  The Other End of the Stick     Before we totally shift our life focus to our Circle of Influence, we need to consider two things in our \nCircle of Concern that merit deeper thought -- consequences and mistakes. \n   While we are free to choose our actions, we are not free to choose the consequences of those actions.  \nConsequences are governed by natural law.  They are out in the Circle of Conc ern.  We can decide to \nstep in front of a fast-moving train, but we canno t decide what will happen when the train hits us. \n   We can decide to be dishonest in our business dealings.  While the social consequences of that \ndecision may vary depending on whether or not we are found out, the natural consequences to our \nbasic character are a fixed result.    Our behavior is governed by principles.  Living in harmony with them brings positive consequences; violating them brings negative conseq uences.

    "text": "  F l y H e a r t  \nsituation, but in doing so, we choose the attendant consequence.  \"When we pick up one end of the \nstick, we pick up the other.\"    Undoubtedly, there have been times in each of our lives when we have picked up what we later felt \nwas the wrong stick.  Our choices have brought cons equences we would rather have lived without.  If \nwe had the choice to make over again, we would make  it differently.  We call these choices mistakes, \nand they are the second thing that merits our deeper thought.    For those filled with regret, perh aps the most needful exercise of pr oactivity is to realize that past \nmistakes are also out there in the Circle of Concer n.  We can't recall them, we can't undo them, we can't \ncontrol the consequences that came as a result.    As a college quarterback, one of my sons learned  to snap his wristband between plays as a kind of \nmental checkoff whenever he or anyone made a \"se tting back\" mistake, so the last mistake wouldn't \naffect the resolve and execution of the next play.    The proactive approach to a mistake is to acknow ledge it instantly, correct it, and learn from it.  \nThis literally turns a failure into a success.  \"Success,\" said IBM founder T.  J.  Watson, \"is on the far side of failure.\"    But not to acknowledge a mistake, not to correct it and learn from it, is a mist ake of a different order.  \nIt usually puts a person on a self-deceiving, self-j ustifying path, often involving rationalization (rational \nlies) to self and to others.  This second mistak e, this cover-up, empowers the first, giving it \ndisproportionate importance, and ca uses far deeper injury to self. \n   It is not what others do or even our own mistakes  that hurt us the most; it is our response to those \nthings.  Chasing after the poisonous snake that bite s us will only drive the poison through our entire \nsystem.  It is far better to take measures immediately to get the poison out.    Our response to any mistake affects the quality of  the next moment.  It is important to immediately \nadmit and correct our mistakes so that they have  no power over that next moment and we are \nempowered again.  Making and Keeping Commitments     At the very heart of our Circle of Influenc e is our ability to make and keep commitments and \npromises.  The commitments we make to ourselve s and to others, and our integrity to those \ncommitments, is the essence and clearest  manifestation of our proactivity. \n   It is also the essence of  our growth.  Through our human endowments of self-awareness and \nconscience, we become conscious of areas of weakness, areas for improvement, areas of talent that could \nbe developed, areas that need to be changed or e liminated from our lives.  Then, as we recognize and \nuse our imagination and independent will to act on that awareness -- making promises, setting goals, \nand being true to them -- we build the strength of character, the being, that makes possible every other \npositive thing in our lives.    It is here that we find two ways to put ourselve s in control of our lives immediately.  We can make \na promise -- and keep it.  Or we can set a goal -- and work to achieve it.  As we make and keep \ncommitments, even small commitments, we begin to es tablish an inner integr ity that gives us the \nawareness of self-control and the courage and strength  to accept more of the responsibility for our own \nlives.  By making and keeping promises to oursel ves and others, little by little, our honor becomes \ngreater than our moods.    The power to make and keep commitments to ours elves is the essence of developing the basic habits \nof effectiveness.  Knowledge, skill, and desire are a ll within our control.  We can work on any one to \nimprove the balance of the three.  As the area of intersection becomes larger, we more deeply \ninternalize the principles upon which the habits are based and create the strength of character to move \nus in a balanced way toward increasing effectiveness in our lives. \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n \nProactivity:  The 30-Day Test     We don't have to go through the death camp e xperience of Frank",

    "text": "  F l y H e a r t  \nsituation, but in doing so, we choose the attendant consequence.  \"When we pick up one end of the \nstick, we pick up the other.\"    Undoubtedly, there have been times in each of our lives when we have picked up what we later felt \nwas the wrong stick.  Our choices have brought cons equences we would rather have lived without.  If \nwe had the choice to make over again, we would make  it differently.  We call these choices mistakes, \nand they are the second thing that merits our deeper thought.    For those filled with regret, perh aps the most needful exercise of pr oactivity is to realize that past \nmistakes are also out there in the Circle of Concer n.  We can't recall them, we can't undo them, we can't \ncontrol the consequences that came as a result.    As a college quarterback, one of my sons learned  to snap his wristband between plays as a kind of \nmental checkoff whenever he or anyone made a \"se tting back\" mistake, so the last mistake wouldn't \naffect the resolve and execution of the next play.    The proactive approach to a mistake is to acknow ledge it instantly, correct it, and learn from it.  \nThis literally turns a failure into a success.  \"Success,\" said IBM founder T.  J.  Watson, \"is on the far side of failure.\"    But not to acknowledge a mistake, not to correct it and learn from it, is a mist ake of a different order.  \nIt usually puts a person on a self-deceiving, self-j ustifying path, often involving rationalization (rational \nlies) to self and to others.  This second mistak e, this cover-up, empowers the first, giving it \ndisproportionate importance, and ca uses far deeper injury to self. \n   It is not what others do or even our own mistakes  that hurt us the most; it is our response to those \nthings.  Chasing after the poisonous snake that bite s us will only drive the poison through our entire \nsystem.  It is far better to take measures immediately to get the poison out.    Our response to any mistake affects the quality of  the next moment.  It is important to immediately \nadmit and correct our mistakes so that they have  no power over that next moment and we are \nempowered",

The proactive approach to a mistake is to acknow ledge it instantly, correct it, and learn from it.  \nThis literally turns a failure into a success.  \"Success,\" said IBM founder T.  J.  Watson, \"is on the far side of failure.\"    But not to acknowledge a mistake, not to correct it and learn from it, is a mist ake of a different order.  \nIt usually puts a person on a self-deceiving, self-j ustifying path, often involving rationalization (rational \nlies) to self and to others.  This second mistak e, this cover-up, empowers the first, giving it \ndisproportionate importance, and ca uses far deeper injury to self. \n   It is not what others do or even our own mistakes  that hurt us the most; it is our response to those \nthings.

It is important to immediately \nadmit and correct our mistakes so that they have  no power over that next moment and we are \nempowered again.  Making and Keeping Commitments     At the very heart of our Circle of Influenc e is our ability to make and keep commitments and \npromises.  The commitments we make to ourselve s and to others, and our integrity to those \ncommitments, is the essence and clearest  manifestation of our proactivity. \n   It is also the essence of  our growth.  Through our human endowments of self-awareness and \nconscience, we become conscious of areas of weakness, areas for improvement, areas of talent that could \nbe developed, areas that need to be changed or e liminated from our lives.  Then, as we recognize and \nuse our imagination and independent will to act on that awareness -- making promises, setting goals, \nand being true to them -- we build the strength of character, the being, that makes possible every other \npositive thing in our lives.    It is here that we find two ways to put ourselve s in control of our lives immediately.  We can make \na promise -- and keep it.  Or we can set a goal -- and work to achieve it.  As we make and keep \ncommitments, even small commitments, we begin to es tablish an inner integr ity that gives us the \nawareness of self-control and the courage and strength  to accept more of the responsibility for our own \nlives.  By making and keeping promises to oursel ves and others, little by little, our honor becomes \ngreater than our moods.    The power to make and keep commitments to ours elves is the essence of developing the basic habits \nof effectiveness.  Knowledge, skill, and desire are a ll within our control.  We can work on any one to \nimprove the balance of the three.  As the area of intersection becomes larger, we more deeply \ninternalize the principles upon which the habits are based and create the strength of character to move \nus in a balanced way toward increasing effectiveness in our lives. \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o",

    "text": " u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n \nProactivity:  The 30-Day Test     We don't have to go through the death camp e xperience of Frankl to recognize and develop our own \nproactivity.  It is in the ordinary events of every day that we develop the proactive capacity to handle the extraordinary pressures of life.  It's how we ma ke and keep commitments, how we handle a traffic \njam, how we respond to an irate customer or a diso bedient child.  It's how we view our problems and \nwhere we focus our energies.  It's the language we use.    I would challenge you to test the principle of proactivity for 30 days.  Simply try it and see what \nhappens.  For 30 days work only in your Circle of Influence.  Make small commitments and keep them.  Be a light, not a judge.  Be a model, not a critic.  Be part of the solution, not part of the \nproblem.    Try it in your marriage, in your family, in yo ur job.  Don't argue for other people's weaknesses.  \nDon't argue for your own.  When you make a mist ake, admit it, correct it, and learn from it -- \nimmediately.  Don't get into a blaming, accusing mode.  Work on things you have control over.  \nWork on you.  On be.    Look at the weaknesses of others with compassi on, not accusation.  It's not what they're not doing \nor should be doing that's the issue.  The issue is your own chos en response to the situation and what \nyou should be doing.  If you start to think the prob lem is \"out there,\" stop yourself.  That thought is \nthe problem.    People who exercise their embryonic freedom day af ter day will, little by little, expand that freedom.  \nPeople who do not will find that it withers until they are literally \"being lived.\" They are acting out the \nscripts written by parents, associates, and society.    We are responsible for our own effectiveness, for our own happiness, and ultimately, I would say, \nfor most of our circumstances.    Samuel Johnson observed: \"The fountain of conten t must spring up in the mind, and he who hath so \nlittle knowledge of human nature as to seek happi ness by changing anything but his own disposition, \nwill waste his life in fruitless efforts and mu ltiply the grief he proposes to remove.\" \n   Knowing that we are responsible -- \"response-able \" -- is fundamental to effectiveness and to every \nother habit of effectiveness we will discuss.  Application Suggestions     1.  For a full day, listen to your language and to the language of the people around you.  How often do you use and hear reactive phrases such  as \"If only,\" \"I can't,\" or \"I have to\" \n   2.  Identify an experience you might encounter in the near future where, based on past experience, \nyou would probably behave reactively.  Review the situat ion in the context of your Circle of Influence.  \nHow could you respond proactively? Take several mo ments and create the experience vividly in your \nmind, picturing yourself responding in a proactive manner.  Remind yourself of the gap between stimulus and response.  Make a commitment to yourself to exercise your freedom to choose.    3.  Select a problem from your work or personal  life that is frustrating to you.  Determine whether \nit is a direct, indirect, or no control problem.  Iden tify the first step you can take in your Circle of \nInfluence to solve it and then take that step.    4.  Try the 30-day test of proactivity.  Be aw are of the change in your Circle of Influence.",

It is in the ordinary events of every day that we develop the proactive capacity to handle the extraordinary pressures of life.  It's how we ma ke and keep commitments, how we handle a traffic \njam, how we respond to an irate customer or a diso bedient child.  It's how we view our problems and \nwhere we focus our energies.  It's the language we use.    I would challenge you to test the principle of proactivity for 30 days.  Simply try it and see what \nhappens.  For 30 days work only in your Circle of Influence.  Make small commitments and keep them.  Be a light, not a judge.  Be a model, not a critic.  Be part of the solution, not part of the \nproblem.    Try it in your marriage, in your family, in yo ur job.  Don't argue for other people's weaknesses.  \nDon't argue for your own.  When you make a mist ake, admit it, correct it, and learn from it -- \nimmediately.  Don't get into a blaming, accusing mode.  Work on things you have control over.  \nWork on you.  On be.    Look at the weaknesses of others with compassi on, not accusation.  It's not what they're not doing \nor should be doing that's the issue.  The issue is your own chos en response to the situation and what \nyou should be doing.  If you start to think the prob lem is \"out there,\" stop yourself.  That thought is \nthe problem.    People who exercise their embryonic freedom day af ter day will, little by little, expand that freedom.  \nPeople who do not will find that it withers until they are literally \"being lived.\" They are acting out the \nscripts written by parents, associates, and society.    We are responsible for our own effectiveness, for our own happiness, and ultimately, I would say, \nfor most of our circumstances.

It is in the ordinary events of every day that we develop the proactive capacity to handle the extraordinary pressures of life.  It's how we ma ke and keep commitments, how we handle a traffic \njam, how we respond to an irate customer or a diso bedient child.  It's how we view our problems and \nwhere we focus our energies.  It's the language we use.    I would challenge you to test the principle of proactivity for 30 days.  Simply try it and see what \nhappens.  For 30 days work only in your Circle of Influence.  Make small commitments and keep them.  Be a light, not a judge.  Be a model, not a critic.  Be part of the solution, not part of the \nproblem.    Try it in your marriage, in your family, in yo ur job.  Don't argue for other people's weaknesses.  \nDon't argue",

    "text": " happiness, and ultimately, I would say, \nfor most of our circumstances.    Samuel Johnson observed: \"The fountain of conten t must spring up in the mind, and he who hath so \nlittle knowledge of human nature as to seek happi ness by changing anything but his own disposition, \nwill waste his life in fruitless efforts and mu ltiply the grief he proposes to remove.\" \n   Knowing that we are responsible -- \"response-able \" -- is fundamental to effectiveness and to every \nother habit of effectiveness we will discuss.  Application Suggestions     1.  For a full day, listen to your language and to the language of the people around you.  How often do you use and hear reactive phrases such  as \"If only,\" \"I can't,\" or \"I have to\" \n   2.  Identify an experience you might encounter in the near future where, based on past experience, \nyou would probably behave reactively.  Review the situat ion in the context of your Circle of Influence.  \nHow could you respond proactively? Take several mo ments and create the experience vividly in your \nmind, picturing yourself responding in a proactive manner.  Remind yourself of the gap between stimulus and response.  Make a commitment to yourself to exercise your freedom to choose.    3.  Select a problem from your work or personal  life that is frustrating to you.  Determine whether \nit is a direct, indirect, or no control problem.  Iden tify the first step you can take in your Circle of \nInfluence to solve it and then take that step.    4.  Try the 30-day test of proactivity.  Be aw are of the change in your Circle of Influence.",

    "text": " happiness, and ultimately, I would say, \nfor most of our circumstances.    Samuel Johnson observed: \"The fountain of conten t must spring up in the mind, and he who hath so \nlittle knowledge of human nature as to seek happi ness by changing anything but his own disposition, \nwill waste his life in fruitless efforts and mu ltiply the grief he proposes to remove.\" \n   Knowing that we are responsible -- \"response-able \" -- is fundamental to effectiveness and to every \nother habit of effectiveness we will discuss.  Application Suggestions     1.  For a full day, listen to your language and to the language of the people around you.  How often do you use and hear reactive phrases such  as \"If only,\" \"I can't,\" or \"I have to\" \n   2.  Identify an experience you might encounter in the near future where, based on past experience, \nyou would probably behave reactively.  Review the situat ion in the context of your Circle of Influence.  \nHow could you respond proactively? Take several mo ments and create the experience vividly in your \nmind, picturing yourself responding in a proactive manner.  Remind yourself of the gap between stimulus and response.",
