But when people become  more mature and thei r own lives take on a separate meaning, they want \ninvolvement, significant involvement.  And if they don't have that involvement, they don't buy it.  \nThen you have a significant motivational problem whic h cannot be solved at the same level of thinking \nthat created it.    That's why creating an organizational mission st atement takes time, patience, involvement, skill, and \nempathy.  Again, it's not a quick fix.  It takes ti me and sincerity, correct principles, and the courage \nand integrity to align systems, structure, and manage ment style to the shared vision and values.  But \nit's based on correct principles and it works.    An organizational mission statem ent -- one that truly reflects the deep shared vision and values of \neveryone within that organization -- creates a great unity and tremendous commitment.  It creates in \npeople's hearts and minds a frame of reference, a set of criteria or gu idelines, by which they will govern \nthemselves.  They don't need someon e else directing, controlling, critic izing, or taking cheap shots.  \nThey have bought into the changeless co re of what the organization is about. \n Application Suggestions     1.  Take the time to record the impressions you had in the funeral visualization at the beginning of \nthis chapter.  You may want to use the chart below to organize your thoughts.    2.  Take a few moments and write down your ro les as you now see them.  Are you satisfied with \nthat mirror image of your life.    3.  Set up time to completely separate yourself  from daily activities and to begin work on your \npersonal mission statement.    4.  Go through the chart in Appendix A show ing different centers and circle all those you can \nidentify with.  Do they form a pattern for the be havior in your life? Are you comfortable with the \nimplications of your analysis.    5.  Start a collection of notes, quotes, and ideas you may want to use as reso urce material in writing \nyour .personal mission statement.    6.  Identify a project you will be facing in the near future and apply th e principles of mental \ncreation.  Write down the results you desire and what steps will lead to those results. \n   7.  Share the principles of Habit 2 with your family or work group and suggest that together you \nbegin the process of developing a fa mily or group mission statement. \n \nHabit 3:  Put First Things First TM -- Principles of Personal Managemen \n    Things which matter most must never be  at the mercy of thin gs which matter least \n   - -  G o e t h  \n                *         *  \n   Will you take just a moment and write down a short answer to the following two questions?  Your \nanswers will be important to you as you begin work on Habit 3.    Question 1: What one thing could you do (you are n't doing now) that if you did on a regular basis, \nwould make a tremendous positive difference in your personal life?    Question 2: What one thing in your business or professional life would bring similar results? \n   We'll come back to these answers later.  But first, let's put Habit 3 in perspective \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n   Habit 3 is the personal fruit, the practical fulfillment of Habits 1 and 2. \n   Habit 1 says, \"You're the creator.  You are in charge.\"  It's based on the four unique human endowments of imagination, conscience, independ ent will, and particularly, self-awareness.  It \nempowers you to say, \"That's an u nhealthy program I've been given fr om my childhood, from my social \nmirror.  I don't like that ineffective script.  I can change.\"",

But when people become  more mature and thei r own lives take on a separate meaning, they want \ninvolvement, significant involvement.  And if they don't have that involvement, they don't buy it.  \nThen you have a significant motivational problem whic h cannot be solved at the same level of thinking \nthat created it.    That's why creating an organizational mission st atement takes time, patience, involvement, skill, and \nempathy.  Again, it's not a quick fix.  It takes ti me and sincerity, correct principles, and the courage \nand integrity to align systems, structure, and manage ment style to the shared vision and values.  But \nit's based on correct principles and it works.    An organizational mission statem ent -- one that truly reflects the deep shared vision and values of \neveryone within that organization -- creates a great unity and tremendous commitment.  It creates in \npeople's hearts and minds a frame of reference, a set of criteria or gu idelines, by which they will govern \nthemselves.  They don't need someon e else directing, controlling, critic izing, or taking cheap shots.  \nThey have bought into the changeless co re of what the organization is about. \n Application Suggestions     1.  Take the time to record the impressions you had in the funeral visualization at the beginning of \nthis chapter.  You may want to use the chart below to organize your thoughts.    2.  Take a few moments and write down your ro les as you now see them.  Are you satisfied with \nthat mirror image of your life.    3.  Set up time to completely separate yourself  from daily activities and to begin work on your \npersonal mission statement.    4.  Go through the chart in Appendix A show ing different centers",

But when people become  more mature and thei r own lives take on a separate meaning, they want \ninvolvement, significant involvement.  And if they don't have that involvement, they don't buy it.  \nThen you have a significant motivational problem whic h cannot be solved at the same level of thinking \nthat created it.    That's why creating an organizational mission st atement takes time, patience, involvement, skill, and \nempathy.  Again, it's not a quick fix.  It takes ti me and sincerity, correct principles, and the courage \nand integrity",

    "text": " self-awareness.  It \nempowers you to say, \"That's an u nhealthy program I've been given fr om my childhood, from my social \nmirror.  I don't like that ineffective script.  I can change.\"    Habit 2 is the first or mental creation.  It's ba sed on imagination -- the ability to envision, to see the \npotential, to create with our minds what we canno t at present see without ey es; and conscience -- the \nability to detect our own uniqueness and the person al, moral, and ethical guidelines within which we \ncan most happily fulfill it.  It's the deep contact wi th our basic paradigms and values and the vision of \nwhat we can become.    Habit 3, then, is the second creation -- the physic al creation.  It's the fulfillment, the actualization, \nthe natural emergence of Habits 1 and 2.  It's the exercise of independ ent will toward becoming \nprinciple-centered.  It's the day-in, day-out, moment-by-moment doing it.    Habits 1 and 2 are absolutely essential an d prerequisite to Habit 3.  You can't become \nprinciple-centered without first being aware of and developing your own proactive nature.  You can't \nbecome principle-centered without first being aware of your paradigms and understanding how to shift \nthem and align them with principl es.  You can't become principle-ce ntered without a vision of and a \nfocus on the unique contribution that is yours to make.    But with that foundation, you can beco me principle-centered, day-in and day-out, \nmoment-by-moment, by living Habit 3 -- by practicing effective self-management. \n   Management, remember, is clearly different from leadership.  Leadership is primarily a \nhigh-powered, right-brain activity.  It's more of an art; it's based on a philosophy.  You have to ask \nthe ultimate questions of life when you're dealing with personal leadership issues. \n   But once you have dealt with those issues, once  you have resolved them, you then have to manage \nyourself effectively to create a life congruent with  your answers.  The ability to manage well doesn't \nmake much difference if you're not even in the \"right  jungle.\"  But if you are  in the right jungle, it \nmakes all the difference.  In fact, the ability to manage well determines the quality and even the \nexistence of the second creation.  Management is the breaking down, the anal ysis, the sequencing, the \nspecific application, the time-bound left-brain aspe ct of effective self-government.  My own maxim of \npersonal effectiveness is this: Manage from the left; lead from the right. \n The Power of Independent Will     In addition to self-awareness, imagination, an d conscience, it is the fo urth human endowment -- \nindependent will -- that really makes effective self -management possible.  It is the ability to make \ndecisions and choices and to act in accordance with th em.  It is the ability to act rather than to be acted \nupon, to proactively carry out the program we have  developed through the other three endowments. \n   The human will is an amazing thing.  Time afte r time, it has triumphed against unbelievable odds.  \nThe Helen Kellers of this world give dramatic eviden ce to the value, the power of the independent will. \n   But as we examine this endowment in the cont ext of effective self-management, we realize it's \nusually not the dramatic, the visible, the once-in-a- lifetime, up-by-the-bootstraps effort that brings \nenduring success.  Empowerment comes from the le arning how to use this great endowment in the \ndecisions we make every day.    The degree to which we have developed our indepe ndent will in our everyday lives is measured by \nour personal integrity.  Integrity is, fundamentally, th e value we place on ourselves.  It's our ability to \nmake and  keep commitments to ourselves, to \"wal k our talk.\"  It's honor with self, a fundamental \npart of the character ethic, the essence of proactive growth.    Effective management is putting first things firs t.  While leadership decides what \"first things\" are, \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \nit is management that puts them first, day-by-d ay, moment-by-moment.  Management is discipline, \ncarrying it out.     Discipline derives from disciple -- disciple to",

It's ba sed on imagination -- the ability to envision, to see the \npotential, to create with our minds what we canno t at present see without ey es; and conscience -- the \nability to detect our own uniqueness and the person al, moral, and ethical guidelines within which we \ncan most happily fulfill it.

Leadership is primarily a \nhigh-powered, right-brain activity.  It's more of an art; it's based on a philosophy.  You have to ask \nthe ultimate questions of life when you're dealing with personal leadership issues. \n   But once you have dealt with those issues, once  you have resolved them, you then have to manage \nyourself effectively to create a life congruent with  your answers.

You can't \nbecome principle-centered without first being aware of your paradigms and understanding how to shift \nthem and align them with principl es.  You can't become principle-ce ntered without a vision of and a \nfocus on the unique contribution that is yours to make.    But with that foundation, you can beco me principle-centered, day-in and day-out, \nmoment-by-moment, by living Habit 3 -- by practicing effective self-management. \n   Management, remember, is clearly different from leadership.  Leadership is primarily a \nhigh-powered, right-brain activity.  It's more of an art; it's based on a philosophy.  You have to ask \nthe ultimate questions of life when you're dealing with personal leadership issues. \n   But once you have dealt with those issues, once  you have resolved them, you then have to manage \nyourself effectively to create a life congruent with  your answers",

    "text": ".  The ability to manage well doesn't \nmake much difference if you're not even in the \"right  jungle.\"  But if you are  in the right jungle, it \nmakes all the difference.  In fact, the ability to manage well determines the quality and even the \nexistence of the second creation.  Management is the breaking down, the anal ysis, the sequencing, the \nspecific application, the time-bound left-brain aspe ct of effective self-government.  My own maxim of \npersonal effectiveness is this: Manage from the left; lead from the right. \n The Power of Independent Will     In addition to self-awareness, imagination, an d conscience, it is the fo urth human endowment -- \nindependent will -- that really makes effective self -management possible.  It is the ability to make \ndecisions and choices and to act in accordance with th em.  It is the ability to act rather than to be acted \nupon, to proactively carry out the program we have  developed through the other three endowments. \n   The human will is an amazing thing.  Time afte r time, it has triumphed against unbelievable odds.  \nThe Helen Kellers of this world give dramatic eviden ce to the value, the power of the independent will. \n   But as we examine this endowment in the cont ext of effective self-management, we realize it's \nusually not the dramatic, the visible, the once-in-a- lifetime, up-by-the-bootstraps effort that brings \nenduring success.  Empowerment comes from the le arning how to use this great endowment in the \ndecisions we make every day.    The degree to which we have developed our indepe ndent will in our everyday lives is measured by \nour personal integrity.  Integrity is, fundamentally, th e value we place on ourselves.  It's our ability to \nmake and  keep commitments to ourselves, to \"wal k our talk.\"  It's honor with self, a fundamental \npart of the character ethic, the essence of proactive growth.    Effective management is putting first things firs t.  While leadership decides what \"first things\" are, \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u",

    "text": "  b y  F l y H e a r t  \nit is management that puts them first, day-by-d ay, moment-by-moment.  Management is discipline, \ncarrying it out.     Discipline derives from disciple -- disciple to a philo sophy, disciple to a set of principles, disciple to \na set of values, disciple to an overriding purpose, to a superordinate goal or a person who represents \nthat goal.    In other words, if you are an effective manager of  your self, your discipline comes from within; it is a \nfunction of your independent will.  You are a discipl e, a follower, of your own deep values and their \nsource.  And you have the will, the integrity, to su bordinate your feelings, your impulses, your moods \nto those values.    One of my favorite essays is \"The Common Deno minator of Success,\" written by E. M. Gray.  He \nspent his life searching for the one denominator that  all successful people share.  He found it wasn't \nhard work, good luck, or astute human relations, th ough those were all importan t.  The one factor that \nseemed to transcend all the rest embodies the e ssence of Habit 3:  Putting First Things First. \n   \"The successful person has the habit of doing th e things failures don't like to do,\" he observed.  \n\"They don't like doing them either necessarily.  But th eir disliking is subordinated to the strength of \ntheir purpose.\"    That subordination requires a purpose, a missi on, a Habit 2 clear sense of direction and value, a \nburning \"Yes!\" inside that makes it possible to say \"n o\" to other things.  It also requires independent \nwill, the power to do something when you don't want to do it, to be a function of your values rather \nthan a function of the impulse or desire of any give n moment.  It's the power to act with integrity to \nyour proactive first creation.  Four Generations of Time Management     In Habit 3 we are dealing with many of the questions addressed in the field of life and time \nmanagement.  As a longtime student of this fascina ting field, I am personally persuaded that the \nessence of the best thinking in the area of time management can be captured in a single phrase: \nOrganize and execute around priorities.  That phrase represents the evolution of three generations of \ntime-management theory, and how to best do it is  the focus of a wide v ariety of approaches and \nmaterials.    Personal management has evolved in a pattern similar to many other areas of human endeavor.  \nMajor developmental thrusts, or \"waves\" as Alvin To ffler calls them, follow each other in succession, \neach adding a vital new dimension.  For example, in  social development, the agricultural revolution \nwas followed by the industrial revolution, which wa s followed by the informational revolution.  Each \nsucceeding wave created a surge of  social and personal progress. \n   Likewise, in the area of time management, each  generation builds on the one before it -- each one \nmoves us toward greater control of our lives.  The first wave or generation could be characterized by \nnotes and checklists, an effort to give some semb lance of recognition and in clusiveness to the many \ndemands placed on our time and energy.    The second generation could be characterized by calendars and appointment books.  This wave \nreflects an attempt to look ahead, to sch edule events and activities in the future. \n   The third generation reflects the current time -management field.  It adds to those preceding \ngenerations the important idea of prioritization, of  clarifying values, and of comparing the relative \nworth of activities based on their re lationship to those values.  In addi tion, it focuses on setting goals -- \nspecific long-, intermediate-, and short-term targ ets toward which time and energy would be directed \nin harmony with values.  It also includes the concept of daily planni ng, of making a specific plan to \naccomplish those goals and activities de termined to be of greatest worth. \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n   While the third generation has made a significan t contribution, people have  begun to realize that \n\"efficient\" scheduling and control of time are often counterproductive.  The efficiency focus creates \nexpectations that clash with the o pportunities to develop rich relationships, to meet human needs, and \nto enjoy spontaneous moments on",

Discipline derives from disciple -- disciple to a philo sophy, disciple to a set of principles, disciple to \na set of values, disciple to an overriding purpose, to a superordinate goal or a person who represents \nthat goal.    In other words, if you are an effective manager of  your self, your discipline comes from within; it is a \nfunction of your independent will.  You are a discipl e, a follower, of your own deep values and their \nsource.  And you have the will, the integrity, to su bordinate your feelings, your impulses, your moods \nto those values.    One of my favorite essays is \"The Common Deno minator of Success,\" written by E. M. Gray.  He \nspent his life searching for the one denominator that  all successful people share.  He found it wasn't \nhard work, good luck, or astute human relations, th ough those were all importan t.  The one factor that \nseemed to transcend all the rest embodies the e ssence of Habit 3:  Putting First Things First. \n   \"The successful person has the habit of doing th e things failures don't like to do,\" he observed.  \n\"They don't like doing them either necessarily.  But th eir disliking is subordinated to the strength of \ntheir purpose.\"    That subordination requires a purpose, a missi on, a Habit 2 clear sense of direction and value, a \nburning \"Yes!\" inside that makes it possible to say \"n o\" to other things.  It also requires independent \nwill, the power to do something when you don't want to do it, to be a function of your values rather \nthan a function of the impulse or desire of any give n moment.  It's the power to act with integrity to \nyour proactive first creation.  Four Generations of Time Management     In Habit 3 we are dealing with many of the questions addressed in the field of life and time \nmanagement.  As a longtime student of this fascina ting field, I am personally persuaded that the \nessence of the best thinking in the area of time management can be captured in a single phrase: \nOrganize and execute around priorities.

Discipline derives from disciple -- disciple to a philo sophy, disciple to a set of principles, disciple to \na set of values, disciple to an overriding purpose, to a superordinate goal or a person who represents \nthat goal.    In other words, if you are an effective manager of  your self, your discipline comes from within; it is a \nfunction of your independent will.  You are a discipl e, a follower, of your own deep values and their \nsource.  And you have the will, the integrity, to su bordinate your feelings, your impulses, your moods \nto those values.    One of my favorite essays is \"The Common Deno minator of Success,\" written by E. M. Gray.  He \nspent his life searching for the one denominator that  all successful people share.  He found it wasn't \nhard work, good luck, or astute human relations, th ough those were all importan t.  The one factor that \nseemed to transcend all the rest",

It's the power to act with integrity to \nyour proactive first creation.

    "text": ".  As a longtime student of this fascina ting field, I am personally persuaded that the \nessence of the best thinking in the area of time management can be captured in a single phrase: \nOrganize and execute around priorities.  That phrase represents the evolution of three generations of \ntime-management theory, and how to best do it is  the focus of a wide v ariety of approaches and \nmaterials.    Personal management has evolved in a pattern similar to many other areas of human endeavor.  \nMajor developmental thrusts, or \"waves\" as Alvin To ffler calls them, follow each other in succession, \neach adding a vital new dimension.  For example, in  social development, the agricultural revolution \nwas followed by the industrial revolution, which wa s followed by the informational revolution.  Each \nsucceeding wave created a surge of  social and personal progress. \n   Likewise, in the area of time management, each  generation builds on the one before it -- each one \nmoves us toward greater control of our lives.  The first wave or generation could be characterized by \nnotes and checklists, an effort to give some semb lance of recognition and in clusiveness to the many \ndemands placed on our time and energy.    The second generation could be characterized by calendars and appointment books.  This wave \nreflects an attempt to look ahead, to sch edule events and activities in the future. \n   The third generation reflects the current time -management field.  It adds to those preceding \ngenerations the important idea of prioritization, of  clarifying values, and of comparing the relative \nworth of activities based on their re lationship to those values.  In addi tion, it focuses on setting goals -- \nspecific long-, intermediate-, and short-term targ ets toward which time and energy would be directed \nin harmony with values.  It also includes the concept of daily planni ng, of making a specific plan to \naccomplish those goals and activities de termined to be of greatest worth. \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n   While the third generation has made a significan t contribution, people have  begun",

The first wave or generation could be characterized by \nnotes and checklists, an effort to give some semb lance of recognition and in clusiveness to the many \ndemands placed on our time and energy.    The second generation could be characterized by calendars and appointment books.  This wave \nreflects an attempt to look ahead, to sch edule events and activities in the future. \n   The third generation reflects the current time -management field.  It adds to those preceding \ngenerations the important idea of prioritization, of  clarifying values, and of comparing the relative \nworth of activities based on their re lationship to those values.  In addi tion, it focuses on setting goals -- \nspecific long-, intermediate-, and short-term targ ets toward which time and energy would be directed \nin harmony with values.  It also includes the concept of daily planni ng, of making a specific plan to \naccomplish those goals and activities de termined to be of greatest worth. \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P",

    "text": " to realize that \n\"efficient\" scheduling and control of time are often counterproductive.  The efficiency focus creates \nexpectations that clash with the o pportunities to develop rich relationships, to meet human needs, and \nto enjoy spontaneous moments on a daily basis.    As a result, many people have become turned off by time management programs and planners that \nmake them feel too scheduled, too restricted, and they \"throw the baby out with the bath water,\" \nreverting to first- or second-generation techniques to  preserve relationships, to meet human needs, and \nto enjoy spontaneous moments on a daily basis.    But there is an emerging fourth generation that  is different in kind.  It recognizes that \"time \nmanagement\" is really a misnomer -- the challenge is  not to manage time, but to manage ourselves.  \nSatisfaction is a function of expectation as well as re alization.  And expectation (and satisfaction) lie in \nour Circle of Influence.    Rather than focusing on things and time, four th-generation expectations focus on preserving and \nenhancing relationships and accomplishing results -- in short, on maintaining the P/PC Balance. \n Quadrant II     The essential focus of the fourth generatio n of management can be captured in the Time \nManagement Matrix diagrammed on the next page.  Basically, we spend time in one of four ways. \n   As you see, the two factors that define an ac tivity are urgent and important.  Urgent means it \nrequires immediate attention.  It's \"Now!\" Urgent th ings act on us.  A ringing phone is urgent.  Most \npeople can't stand the thought of just allowing th e phone to ring.  You could spend hours preparing \nmaterials, you could get all dressed up and travel to a person's office to discuss a particular issue, but if \nthe phone were to ring while you were there, it woul d generally take precedence over your personal \nvisit.    If you were to phone someone, there aren't ma ny people who would say, \"I'll get to you in 15 \nminutes; just hold.\"  But those same people would pr obably let you wait in an office for at least that \nlong while they completed a telephon e conversation with someone else. \n   Urgent matters are usually visible.  They press on us; they insist on acti on.  They're often popular \nwith others.  They're usually right in  front of us.  And often they are pleasant, easy, fun to do.  But so \noften they are unimportant!    Importance, on the other hand, has to do with resu lts.  If something is important, it contributes to \nyour mission, your values, your high priority goals.    We react to urgent matters.  Important matters that are not urgent require more initiative, more \nproactivity.  We must act to seize opportunity, to make things happen.  If we don't practice Habit 2, if \nwe don't have a clear idea of what is important, of the results we desire in our lives, we are easily \ndiverted into responding to the urgent.    Look for a moment at the four quadrants in the Time Management Matrix.  Quadrant I is both \nurgent and important.  It deals with significant re sults that require immediate attention.  We usually \ncall the activities in Quadrant I \"crises\" or \"problems .\"  We all have some Quadrant I activities in our \nlives.  But Quadrant I consumes many people.  They  are crisis managers, problem-minded people, the \ndeadline-driven producers.    As long as you focus on Quadrant I, it keeps ge tting bigger and bigger until it dominates you.  It's \nlike the pounding surf.  A huge problem comes an d knocks you down and you're wiped out.  You \nstruggle back up only to face another one that knocks you down and slams you to the ground. \n   Some people are literally beaten up by the proble ms all day every day.  The only relief they have is \nin escaping to the not important, no t urgent activities of Quadrant IV.  So when you look at their total \nmatrix, 90 percent of their time is in Quadrant I and mo st of the remaining 10 percent is in Quadrant IV  \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \nwith only negligible attention paid  to Quadrants II and III.  That's  how people who manage their lives \nby crisis live.     There are other people who spend a great deal of  time in \"urgent,",

    "text": " to realize that \n\"efficient\" scheduling and control of time are often counterproductive.  The efficiency focus creates \nexpectations that clash with the o pportunities to develop rich relationships, to meet human needs, and \nto enjoy spontaneous moments on a daily basis.    As a result, many people have become turned off by time management programs and planners that \nmake them feel too scheduled, too restricted, and they \"throw the baby out with the bath water,\" \nreverting to first- or second-generation techniques to  preserve relationships, to meet human needs, and \nto enjoy spontaneous moments on a daily basis.    But there is an emerging fourth generation that  is different in kind.  It recognizes that \"time \nmanagement\" is really a misnomer -- the challenge is  not to manage time, but to manage ourselves.  \nSatisfaction is a function of expectation as well as re alization.  And expectation (and satisfaction) lie in \nour Circle of Influence.    Rather than focusing on things and time, four th-generation expectations focus on preserving and \nenhancing relationships and accomplishing results -- in short, on maintaining the P/PC Balance. \n Quadrant II     The essential focus of the fourth generatio n of management can be captured in the Time \nManagement Matrix diagrammed on the next page.  Basically, we spend time in one of four ways. \n   As you see, the two factors that define an ac tivity are urgent and important.  Urgent means it \nrequires immediate attention.  It's \"Now!\" Urgent th ings act on us.  A ringing phone is urgent.  Most \npeople can't stand the thought of just allowing th e phone to ring.  You could spend hours preparing \nmaterials, you could get all dressed up and travel to a person's office to discuss a particular issue, but if \nthe phone were to ring while you were there, it woul d generally take precedence over your personal \nvisit.    If you were to phone someone, there aren't ma ny people who would say, \"I'll get to you in 15 \nminutes; just hold.\"  But those same people would pr obably let you wait in an office for at least that \nlong while they completed a telephon e conversation with someone else. \n   Urgent matters are usually visible.  They press on us; they insist on acti on.  They're often popular \nwith others.  They're usually right in  front of us",

The efficiency focus creates \nexpectations that clash with the o pportunities to develop rich relationships, to meet human needs, and \nto enjoy spontaneous moments on a daily basis.    As a result, many people have become turned off by time management programs and planners that \nmake them feel too scheduled, too restricted, and they \"throw the baby out with the bath water,\" \nreverting to first- or second-generation techniques to  preserve relationships, to meet human needs, and \nto enjoy spontaneous moments on a daily basis.    But there is an emerging fourth generation that  is different in kind.  It recognizes that \"time \nmanagement\" is really a misnomer -- the challenge is  not to manage time, but to manage ourselves.  \nSatisfaction is a function of expectation as well as re alization.  And expectation (and satisfaction) lie in \nour Circle of Influence.    Rather than focusing on things and time, four th-generation expectations focus on preserving and \nenhancing relationships and accomplishing results -- in short, on maintaining the P/PC Balance. \n Quadrant II     The essential focus of the fourth generatio n of management can be captured",

Basically, we spend time in one of four ways. \n   As you see, the two factors that define an ac tivity are urgent and important.  Urgent means it \nrequires immediate attention.  It's \"Now!\" Urgent th ings act on us.  A ringing phone is urgent.  Most \npeople can't stand the thought of just allowing th e phone to ring.  You could spend hours preparing \nmaterials, you could get all dressed up and travel to a person's office to discuss a particular issue, but if \nthe phone were to ring while you were there, it woul d generally take precedence over your personal \nvisit.    If you were to phone someone, there aren't ma ny people who would say, \"I'll get to you in 15 \nminutes; just hold.\"  But those same people would pr obably let you wait in an office for at least that \nlong while they completed",

They're usually right in  front of us.  And often they are pleasant, easy, fun to do.  But so \noften they are unimportant!    Importance, on the other hand, has to do with resu lts.  If something is important, it contributes to \nyour mission, your values, your high priority goals.    We react to urgent matters.  Important matters that are not urgent require more initiative, more \nproactivity.  We must act to seize opportunity, to make things happen.  If we don't practice Habit 2, if \nwe don't have a clear idea of what is important, of the results we desire in our lives, we are easily \ndiverted into responding to the urgent.    Look for a moment at the four quadrants in the Time Management Matrix.  Quadrant I is both \nurgent and important.  It deals with significant re sults that require immediate attention.  We usually \ncall the activities in Quadrant I \"crises\" or \"problems .\"  We all have some Quadrant I activities in our \nlives.  But Quadrant I consumes many people.  They  are crisis managers, problem-minded people, the \ndeadline-driven producers.    As long as you focus on Quadrant I, it keeps ge tting bigger and bigger until it dominates you.  It's \nlike the pounding surf.  A huge problem comes an d knocks you down and you're wiped out.  You \nstruggle back up only to face another one that knocks you down and slams you to the ground. \n   Some people are literally beaten up by the proble ms all day every day.  The only relief they have is \nin escaping to the not important, no t urgent activities of Quadrant IV.  So when you look at their total \nmatrix, 90 percent of their time is in Quadrant I and mo st of the remaining 10 percent is in Quadrant IV  \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H",

We usually \ncall the activities in Quadrant I \"crises\" or \"problems .\"  We all have some Quadrant I activities in our \nlives.  But Quadrant I consumes many people.  They  are crisis managers, problem-minded people, the \ndeadline-driven producers.    As long as you focus on Quadrant I, it keeps ge tting bigger and bigger until it dominates you.  It's \nlike the pounding surf.  A huge problem comes an d knocks you down and you're wiped out.  You \nstruggle back up only to face another one that knocks you down and slams you to the ground. \n   Some people are literally beaten up by the proble ms all day every day.  The only relief they have is \nin escaping to the not important, no t urgent activities of Quadrant IV.  So when you look at their total \nmatrix, 90 percent of their time is in Quadrant I and mo st of the remaining 10 percent is in Quadrant IV  \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S",

    "text": " e a r t  \nwith only negligible attention paid  to Quadrants II and III.  That's  how people who manage their lives \nby crisis live.     There are other people who spend a great deal of  time in \"urgent, but not important\" Quadrant III, \nthinking they're in Quadrant I.  They spend most of  their time reacting to things that are urgent, \nassuming they are also important.  But the reality is  that the urgency of these matters is often based on \nthe priorities and expectations of others.    People who spend time almost exclusively in Quad rants III and IV basically lead irresponsible lives. \n   Effective people stay out of Quadrants III and IV because, urgent or not, they aren't important.  \nThey also shrink Quadrant I down to size  by spending more time in Quadrant II. \n   Quadrant II is the heart of effective personal mana gement.  It deals with things that are not urgent, \nbut are important.  It deals wi th things like building relationsh ips, writing a personal mission \nstatement, long-range planning, exercising, preventi ve maintenance, preparation -- all those things we \nknow we need to do, but somehow seldom get around to doing, because they aren't urgent. \n   To paraphrase Peter Drucker, effective people are not problem-minded; they're opportunity-minded.  \nThey feed opportunities and starve problems.  They think preventively.  They have genuine \nQuadrant I crises and emergencies that require their immediate attention, but the number is \ncomparatively small.  They keep P and PC in balance by focusing on the import ant, but not the urgent, \nhigh-leverage capacity-building activities of Quadrant II.    With the Time Management Matrix in mind, take a moment now and consider how you answered \nthe questions at the beginning of this chapter.  What  quadrant do they fit in?  Are they important?  \nAre they urgent?    My guess is that they probably fit into Qu adrant II.  They are obviously important, deeply \nimportant, but not urgent.  And because they aren't urgent, you don't do them. \n   Now look again at the nature of those questions:  What one thing could you do in your personal and \nprofessional life that, if you did on a regular basi s, would make a tremendous positive difference in \nyour life?  Quadrant II activities have that kind of  impact.  Our effectiveness takes the quantum leaps \nwhen we do them.    I asked a similar question to a group of shopping center managers .  \"If you were to do one thing in \nyour professional work that you know would have enormously positive effects on the results, what \nwould it be?\"  Their unanimous resp onse was to build helpful personal relationships with the tenants, \nthe owners of the stores inside the shoppi ng center, which is a Quadrant II activity. \n   We did an analysis of the time they were spendi ng on that activity.  It was less than 5 percent.  \nThey had good reasons -- problems, one right after an other.  They had reports to make out, meetings \nto go to, correspondence to answer, phone calls to make, constant interruptions.  Quadrant I had \nconsumed them.    They were spending very little time with the store managers, and the time  they did spend was filled \nwith negative energy.  The only reason they visited the store mana gers at all was to enforce the \ncontract -- to collect the money or discuss advertising or other practice s that were out of harmony with \ncenter guidelines, or some similar thing.    The store owners were struggling for survival , let alone prosperity.  They had employment \nproblems, cost problems, inventory problems, and a host of other problems.  Most of them had no \ntraining in management at all.  Some were fairly  good merchandisers, but they needed help.  The \ntenants didn't even want to see the shopping ce nter owners; they were just one more problem to \ncontend with.    So the owners decided to be proactive.  The\ny determined their purpose, their values, their priorities.  \nIn harmony with those priorities, they decided to  spend about one-third of their time in helping \nrelationships with the tenants. \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n   In working with that organization for about a ye ar and a half, I saw them c limb to around 20 percent, \nwhich represented more than a fourfold increase.  In  addition, they changed their role.  They became \nlisteners, trainers, consultants to the tenants.",

There are other people who spend a great deal of  time in \"urgent, but not important\" Quadrant III, \nthinking they're in Quadrant I.  They spend most of  their time reacting to things that are urgent, \nassuming they are also important.  But the reality is  that the urgency of these matters is often based on \nthe priorities and expectations of others.    People who spend time almost exclusively in Quad rants III and IV basically lead irresponsible lives. \n   Effective people stay out of Quadrants III and IV because, urgent or not, they aren't important.  \nThey also shrink Quadrant I down to size  by spending more time in Quadrant II. \n   Quadrant II is the heart of effective personal mana gement.  It deals with things that are not urgent, \nbut are important.  It deals wi th things like building relationsh ips, writing a personal mission \nstatement, long-range planning, exercising, preventi ve maintenance, preparation -- all those things we \nknow we need to do, but somehow seldom get around to doing, because they aren't urgent. \n   To paraphrase Peter Drucker, effective people are not problem-minded; they're opportunity-minded.  \nThey feed opportunities and starve problems.  They think preventively.  They have genuine \nQuadrant I crises and emergencies that require their immediate attention, but the number is \ncomparatively small.  They keep P and PC in balance by focusing on the import ant, but not the urgent, \nhigh-leverage capacity-building activities of Quadrant II.    With the Time Management Matrix in mind, take a moment now and consider how you answered \nthe questions at the beginning of this chapter.  What  quadrant do they fit in?  Are they important?  \nAre they urgent?    My guess is that they probably fit into Qu adrant II.  They are obviously important, deeply \nimportant, but not urgent.  And because they aren't urgent, you don't do them. \n   Now look again at the nature of those questions:  What one thing could you do in your personal and \nprofessional life that, if you did on a regular basi s, would make a tremendous positive difference in \nyour life?  Quadrant II activities have that kind of  impact.  Our effectiveness takes",

There are other people who spend a great deal of  time in \"urgent, but not important\" Quadrant III, \nthinking they're in Quadrant I.  They spend most of  their time reacting to things that are urgent, \nassuming they are also important.  But the reality is  that the urgency of these matters is often based on \nthe priorities and expectations of others.    People who spend time almost exclusively in Quad rants III and IV basically lead irresponsible lives. \n   Effective people stay out of Quadrants III and IV because, urgent or not, they aren't important.  \nThey also shrink Quadrant I down to size  by spending more time in Quadrant II. \n   Quadrant II is the heart of effective personal mana gement.  It deals with things that are not urgent, \nbut are important.  It deals wi th things like building relationsh ips, writing a personal mission \nstatement, long-range planning, exercising, preventi ve maintenance, preparation -- all those things we \nknow we need to do, but somehow seldom get around to doing,",

Quadrant II activities have that kind of  impact.  Our effectiveness takes the quantum leaps \nwhen we do them.    I asked a similar question to a group of shopping center managers .  \"If you were to do one thing in \nyour professional work that you know would have enormously positive effects on the results, what \nwould it be?\"  Their unanimous resp onse was to build helpful personal relationships with the tenants, \nthe owners of the stores inside the shoppi ng center, which is a Quadrant II activity. \n   We did an analysis of the time they were spendi ng on that activity.  It was less than 5 percent.  \nThey had good reasons -- problems, one right after an other.  They had reports to make out, meetings \nto go to, correspondence to answer, phone calls to make, constant interruptions.  Quadrant I had \nconsumed them.    They were spending very little time with the store managers, and the time  they did spend was filled \nwith negative energy.  The only reason they visited the store mana gers at all was to enforce the \ncontract -- to collect the money or discuss advertising or other practice s that were out of harmony with \ncenter guidelines, or some similar thing.    The store owners were struggling for survival , let alone prosperity.  They had employment \nproblems, cost problems, inventory problems, and a host of other problems.  Most of them had no \ntraining in management at all.  Some were fairly  good merchandisers, but they needed help.  The \ntenants didn't even want to see the shopping ce nter owners; they were just one more problem to \ncontend with.    So the owners decided to be proactive.  The\ny determined their purpose, their values, their priorities.  \nIn harmony with those priorities, they decided to  spend about one-third of their time in helping \nrelationships with the tenants. \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n   In working with that organization for about a",

The store owners were struggling for survival , let alone prosperity.  They had employment \nproblems, cost problems, inventory problems, and a host of other problems.  Most of them had no \ntraining in management at all.  Some were fairly  good merchandisers, but they needed help.  The \ntenants didn't even want to see the shopping ce nter owners; they were just one more problem to \ncontend with.    So the owners decided to be proactive.

    "text": " ye ar and a half, I saw them c limb to around 20 percent, \nwhich represented more than a fourfold increase.  In  addition, they changed their role.  They became \nlisteners, trainers, consultants to the tenants.  Th eir interchanges were filled with positive energy. \n   The effect was dramatic, profound.  By focusing  on relationships and results rather than time and \nmethods, the numbers went up, the tenants were thr illed with the results created by new ideas and \nskills, and the shopping center mana gers were more effective and satisfied and increased their list of \npotential tenants and lease revenue based on increased sales by the tenant stores.  They were no longer \npolicemen or hovering supervisors.  They were problem solvers, helpers.    Whether you are a student at the university, a worker in an assembly line, a homemaker, fashion \ndesigner, or president of a company, I believe th at if you were to ask what lies in Quadrant II and \ncultivate the proactivity to go after it, you would find the same results.  Your effectiveness would \nincrease dramatically.  Your crises and problems would shrink to manageable proportions because you would be thinking ahead, working on the roots, doing the preventive things that keep situations \nfrom developing into crises in the first place.  In the time management jargon, this is called the Pareto \nPrinciple -- 80 percent of the results flow out of 20 percent of the activities.  What it Takes to Say \"No\"     The only place to get time for Quadrant II in th e beginning is from Quadrants III and IV.  You can't \nignore the urgent and important activities of Quadrant  I, although it will shrink in size as you spend \nmore time with prevention and preparation in Quadra nt II.  But the initial time for Quadrant II has \ncome out of III and IV.    You have to be proactive to work on Quadrant II because Quadrant I and III work on you.  To say \n\"yes\" to important Quadrant II priorities, you have to  learn to say \"no\" to other activities, sometimes \napparently urgent things.    Some time ago, my wife was invited to serve as chairman of a committee in a community endeavor.  \nShe had a number of truly important things she was tryi ng to work on, and she re ally didn't want to do \nit.  But she felt pressured into it and finally agreed.    Then she called one of her dear friends to ask if she would serve on her committee.  Her friend \nlistened for a long time and then said, \"Sandra, that  sounds like a wonderful project, a really worthy \nundertaking.  I appreciate so much your inviting me to be a part of it.  I feel honored by it.  For a \nnumber of reasons, I won't be participating myself, but I want you to know how much I appreciate your \ninvitation.\"    Sandra was ready for anything but a pleasant \"no.\"  She turned to me and sighed, \"I wish I'd said \nthat.\"    I don't mean to imply that you shouldn't be invo lved in significant service projects.  Those things \nare important.  But you have to decide what your  highest priorities are and have the  courage -- \npleasantly, smiling, nonapologetically -- to say \"no\" to other things.  And the way you do that is by \nhaving a bigger \"yes\" burning inside.  The enemy of the \"best\" is often the \"good.\" \n   K e e p  i n  m i n d  t h a t  y o u  a r e  a l w a y s  s a y i n g  \" n o \"  to something.  If it isn't to the apparent, urgent \nthings in your life, it is probably to the more fundamental, highly important things.  Even when the \nurgent is good, the good can keep you from your best , keep you from your uniq ue contributions, if you \nlet it.    When I was Director of University Relations at a large university, I hired a very talented, proactive, creative writer.  One day, after he had been on the job for a few months, I went into his office and \nasked him to work on some urgent matters that were pressing on me. \n   He said, \"Stephen, I'll do whatever you want me  to do.  Just let me share with you my situation.\" \n   Then he took me over to his wall board, where he had listed over two dozen projects he was \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t",

They became \nlisteners, trainers, consultants to the tenants.  Th eir interchanges were filled with positive energy. \n   The effect was dramatic, profound.  By focusing  on relationships and results rather than time and \nmethods, the numbers went up, the tenants were thr illed with the results created by new ideas and \nskills, and the shopping center mana gers were more effective and satisfied and increased their list of \npotential tenants and lease revenue based on increased sales by the tenant stores.  They were no longer \npolicemen or hovering supervisors.  They were problem solvers, helpers.    Whether you are a student at the university, a worker in an assembly line, a homemaker, fashion \ndesigner, or president of a company, I believe th at if you were to ask what lies in Quadrant II and \ncultivate the proactivity to go after it, you would find the same results.  Your effectiveness would \nincrease dramatically.  Your crises and problems would shrink to manageable proportions because you would be thinking ahead, working on the roots, doing the preventive things that keep situations \nfrom developing into crises in the first place.  In the time management jargon, this is called the Pareto \nPrinciple -- 80 percent of the results flow out of 20 percent of the activities.  What it Takes to Say \"No\"     The only place to get time for Quadrant II in th e beginning is from Quadrants III and IV.  You can't \nignore the urgent and important activities of Quadrant  I, although it will shrink in size as you spend \nmore time with prevention and preparation in Quadra nt II.  But the initial time for Quadrant II has \ncome out of III and IV.    You have to be proactive to work on Quadrant II because Quadrant I and III work on you.  To say \n\"yes\" to important Quadrant II priorities, you have to  learn to say \"no\" to other activities, sometimes \napparently urgent things.    Some time ago, my wife was invited to serve as chairman of a committee in a community endeavor.  \nShe had a number of truly important things she was tryi ng to work on, and she re ally didn't want to do \nit.

Your crises and problems would shrink to manageable proportions because you would be thinking ahead, working on the roots, doing the preventive things that keep situations \nfrom developing into crises in the first place.  In the time management jargon, this is called the Pareto \nPrinciple -- 80 percent of the results flow out of 20 percent of the activities.  What it Takes to Say \"No\"     The only place to get time for Quadrant II in th e beginning is from Quadrants III and IV.  You can't \nignore the urgent and important activities of Quadrant  I, although it will shrink in size as you spend \nmore time with prevention and preparation in Quadra nt II.  But the initial time for Quadrant II has \ncome out of III and IV.    You have to be proactive to work on Quadrant II because Quadrant I and III work on you.  To say \n\"yes\" to important Quadrant II priorities, you have to  learn to say \"no\" to other activities, sometimes \napparently urgent things.    Some time ago, my wife",

But she felt pressured into it and finally agreed.    Then she called one of her dear friends to ask if she would serve on her committee.  Her friend \nlistened for a long time and then said, \"Sandra, that  sounds like a wonderful project, a really worthy \nundertaking.  I appreciate so much your inviting me to be a part of it.  I feel honored by it.  For a \nnumber of reasons, I won't be participating myself, but I want you to know how much I appreciate your \ninvitation.\"    Sandra was ready for anything but a pleasant \"no.\"  She turned to me and sighed, \"I wish I'd said \nthat.\"    I don't mean to imply that you shouldn't be invo lved in significant service projects.

One day, after he had been on the job for a few months, I went into his office and \nasked him to work on some urgent matters that were pressing on me. \n   He said, \"Stephen, I'll do whatever you want me  to do.

He was highly disciplined, which is why I wen t to see him in the first place.  \"If you want to \nget something done, give it to a busy man.\"    Then he said, \"Stephen, to do the jobs that yo u want done right would take several days.  Which of \nthese projects would you like me to delay or cancel to satisfy your request?\"    Well, I didn't want to take the responsibility for that.  I didn't want to put a cog in the wheel of one \nof the most productive people on the staff just becaus e I happened to be managing by crisis at the time.  \nThe jobs I wanted done were urgent , but not important.  So I went and found another crisis manager \nand gave the job to him.    We say \"yes\" or \"no\" to things daily, usually many times a day.  A center of correct principles and a focus on our personal mission empowers us with wisdom to make those judgments effectively. \n   As I work with different groups, I tell them that  the essence of effective time and life management is \nto organize and execute around balanced priorities.  Then I ask this questi on: if you were to fault \nyourself in one of three areas, which would it be: (1) the inability to prioritize; (2) the inability or desire \nto organize around those priorities; or (3) the lack of discipline to execute aro und them, to stay with \nyour priorities and organization?    Most people say their main fault is a lack of disci pline.  On deeper thought, I believe that is not the \ncase.  The basic problem is that their priorities have not become deeply planted in their hearts and \nminds.  They haven't really internalized Habit 2.    There are many people who recognize the value of Quadrant II activities in their lives, whether they \nidentify them as such or not.  And they attempt to  give priority to those activities and integrate them \ninto their lives through self-discipline alone.  Bu t without a principle center and a personal mission \nstatement, they don't have the necessary foundation to sustain their efforts.  They're working on the \nleaves, on the attitudes and the behaviors of disciplin e, without even thinking to examine the roots, the \nbasic paradigms from which their na tural attitudes and behaviors flow. \n   A Quadrant II focus is a paradigm that grows out of  a principle center.  If you are centered on your \nspouse, your money, your friends, your pleasure, or  any extrinsic factor, you will keep getting thrown \nback into Quadrants I and III, reac ting to the outside forces your lif e is centered on.  Even if you're \ncentered on yourself, you'll end up in I and II reacting to the impulse of the moment.  Your \nindependent will alone cannot effectively discipline you against your center.    In the words of the architectural maxim, form  follows function.  Likewise, management follows \nleadership.  The way you spend your time is a resu lt of the way you see your time and the way you \nreally see your priorities.  If your priorities grow  out of a principle center and a personal mission, if \nthey are deeply planted in your heart and in your mind, you will see Quadrant II as a natural, exciting \nplace to invest your time.    It's almost impossible to say, \"no\" to the popul arity of Quadrant III or to the pleasure of escape to \nQuadrant IV if you don't have a bigger \"yes\" burning inside.  Only when you have the self-awareness \nto examine your program -- an d the imagination and conscience  to create a new, unique, \nprinciple-centered program to which you can sa y \"yes\" -- only then will you have sufficient \nindependent will power to say \"no,\" with a genuine smile, to the unimportant.  Moving Into Quadrant II     If Quadrant II activities are clearly the heart of effective personal management -- the \"first things\" we \nneed to put first -- then how do we or ganize and execute around those things \n   The first generation of time management does no t even recognize the concept of priority.  It gives \nus notes and \"to do\" lists that we can cross off, an d we feel a temporary sense of accomplishment every \ntime we check something off, but no priority is attach ed to items on",

Which of \nthese projects would you like me to delay or cancel to satisfy your request?\"    Well, I didn't want to take the responsibility for that.  I didn't want to put a cog in the wheel of one \nof the most productive people on the staff just becaus e I happened to be managing by crisis at the time.  \nThe jobs I wanted done were urgent , but not important.

A center of correct principles and a focus on our personal mission empowers us with wisdom to make those judgments effectively. \n   As I work with different groups, I tell them that  the essence of effective time and life management is \nto organize and execute around balanced priorities.  Then I ask this questi on: if you were to fault \nyourself in one of three areas, which would it be: (1) the inability to prioritize; (2) the inability or desire \nto organize around those priorities; or (3) the lack of discipline to execute aro und them, to stay with \nyour priorities and organization?    Most people say their main fault is a lack of disci pline.  On deeper thought, I believe that is not the \ncase.  The basic problem is that their priorities have not become deeply planted in their hearts and \nminds.  They haven't really internalized Habit 2.    There are many people who recognize the value of Quadrant II activities in their lives, whether they \nidentify them as such or not.  And they attempt to  give priority to those activities and integrate them \ninto their lives through self-disc",

    "text": ".    There are many people who recognize the value of Quadrant II activities in their lives, whether they \nidentify them as such or not.  And they attempt to  give priority to those activities and integrate them \ninto their lives through self-discipline alone.  Bu t without a principle center and a personal mission \nstatement, they don't have the necessary foundation to sustain their efforts.  They're working on the \nleaves, on the attitudes and the behaviors of disciplin e, without even thinking to examine the roots, the \nbasic paradigms from which their na tural attitudes and behaviors flow. \n   A Quadrant II focus is a paradigm that grows out of  a principle center.  If you are centered on your \nspouse, your money, your friends, your pleasure, or  any extrinsic factor, you will keep getting thrown \nback into Quadrants I and III, reac ting to the outside forces your lif e is centered on.  Even if you're \ncentered on yourself, you'll end up in I and II reacting to the impulse of the moment.  Your \nindependent will alone cannot effectively discipline you against your center.    In the words of the architectural maxim, form  follows function.  Likewise, management follows \nleadership.  The way you spend your time is a resu lt of the way you see your time and the way you \nreally see your priorities.  If your priorities grow  out of a principle center and a personal mission, if \nthey are deeply planted in your heart and in your mind, you will see Quadrant II as a natural, exciting \nplace to invest your time.    It's almost impossible to say, \"no\" to the popul arity of Quadrant III or to the pleasure of escape to \nQuadrant IV if you don't have a bigger \"yes\" burning inside.  Only when you have the self-awareness \nto examine your program -- an d the imagination and conscience  to create a new, unique, \nprinciple-centered program to which you can sa y \"yes\" -- only then will you have sufficient \nindependent will power to say \"no,\" with a genuine smile, to the unimportant.  Moving Into Quadrant II     If Quadrant II activities are clearly the heart of effective personal management -- the \"first things\" we \nneed to put first -- then how do we or ganize and execute around those things \n   The first generation of time management does no t even",

And they attempt to  give priority to those activities and integrate them \ninto their lives through self-discipline alone.  Bu t without a principle center and a personal mission \nstatement, they don't have the necessary foundation to sustain their efforts.  They're working on the \nleaves, on the attitudes and the behaviors of disciplin e, without even thinking to examine the roots, the \nbasic paradigms from which their na tural attitudes and behaviors flow. \n   A Quadrant II focus is a paradigm that grows out of  a principle center.  If you are centered on your \nspouse, your money, your friends, your pleasure, or  any extrinsic factor, you will keep getting thrown \nback into Quadrants I and III, reac ting to the outside forces your lif e is centered on.  Even if you're \ncentered on yourself, you'll end up in I and II reacting to the impulse of the moment.  Your \nindependent will alone cannot effectively discipline you against your center.    In the words of the architectural maxim, form  follows function. ",

In the words of the architectural maxim, form  follows function.  Likewise, management follows \nleadership.  The way you spend your time is a resu lt of the way you see your time and the way you \nreally see your priorities.  If your priorities grow  out of a principle center and a personal mission, if \nthey are deeply planted in your heart and in your mind, you will see Quadrant II as a natural, exciting \nplace to invest your time.    It's almost impossible to say, \"no\" to the popul arity of Quadrant III or to the pleasure of escape to \nQuadrant IV if you don't have a bigger \"yes\" burning inside.  Only when you have the self-awareness \nto examine your program -- an d the imagination and conscience  to create a new, unique, \nprinciple-centered program to which you can sa y \"yes\" -- only then will you have sufficient \nindependent will power to say \"no,\" with a genuine smile, to the unimportant.

    "text": " recognize the concept of priority.  It gives \nus notes and \"to do\" lists that we can cross off, an d we feel a temporary sense of accomplishment every \ntime we check something off, but no priority is attach ed to items on the list.  In addition, there is no \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \ncorrelation between what's on the list and our ulti mate values and purposes in life.  We simply \nrespond to whatever penetrates our aware ness and apparently needs to be done. \n    Many people manage from this first-generation paradigm.  It's the course of least resistance.  \nThere's no pain or strain; it's fun to \"go with the flow.\"  Externally imposed disciplines and schedules \ngive people the feeling that they  aren't responsible for results. \n   But first-generation managers, by definition, are not effective people.  They  produce very little, and \ntheir life-style does nothing to build their Production  Capability.  Buffeted by outside forces, they are \noften seen as undependable and irresponsible, and they  have very little sense of control and self-esteem. \n   Second-generation managers assume a little more  control.  They plan an d schedule in advance and \ngenerally are seen as more responsible beca use they \"show up\" when they're supposed to. \n   But again, the activities they schedule have no priority or recognized correlation to deeper values \nand goals.  They have few significant achi evements and tend to be schedule-oriented. \n   Third-generation managers take a significant step forward.  They clarify their values and set goals.  \nThey plan each day and pr ioritize their activities. \n   As I have said, this is where most of the time-m anagement field is today.  But this third generation \nhas some critical limitations.  First, it limits vision  -- daily planning often misses important things that \ncan only be seen from a larger perspective.  The ve ry language \"daily planning\" focuses on the urgent \n-- the \"now.\"  While third generation prioritization pr ovides order to activity, it doesn't question the \nessential importance of the activity in the first plac e -- it doesn't place the activity in the context of \nprinciples, personal mission, role s, and goals.  The third-generat ion value-driven daily planning \napproach basically prioritizes the Quadrant I and III problems and crises of the day. \n   In addition, the third generation makes no provisio n for managing roles in a balanced way.  It lacks \nrealism, creating the tendency to over-schedule th e day, resulting in frustration and the desire to \noccasionally throw away the plan and escape to Quadrant  IV.  And its e fficiency, time-management \nfocus tends to strain relation ships rather than build them. \n   While each of the three generations has recogn ized the value of some kind of management tool, \nnone has produced a tool that em powers a person to live a principle- centered, Quadrant II life-style.  \nThe first-generation note pads and \"to do\" lists give us no more than a place to capture those things that \npenetrate our awareness so we won't forget them .  The second-generation appointment books and \ncalendars merely provide a place to record our fu ture commitments so that  we can be where we have \nagreed to be at the appropriate time.    Even the third generation, with its vast array of  planners and materials, focuses primarily on helping \npeople prioritize and plan their Quadrant I and III ac tivities.  Though many trainers and consultants \nrecognize the value of Quadrant II activities, the actu al planning tools of the third generation do not \nfacilitate organizing and executing around them.    As each generation builds on those that have prec eded it, the strengths and some of the tools of each \nof the first three generations provide elemental materi al for the fourth.  But there is an added need for \na new dimension, for the paradigm and the implem entation that will empo w e r  u s  t o  m o v e  i n t o  \nQuadrant II, to become principle-centered and to mana ge ourselves to do what is truly most important. \n The Quadrant II Tool     The objective of Quadrant II management is to ma nage our lives effectively -- from a center of sound \nprinciples, for a knowledge of our pe rsonal mission, with a focus on th e important as well as the urgent, \nand within the framework of mainta ining",

We simply \nrespond to whatever penetrates our aware ness and apparently needs to be done. \n    Many people manage from this first-generation paradigm.  It's the course of least resistance.  \nThere's no pain or strain; it's fun to \"go with the flow.\"  Externally imposed disciplines and schedules \ngive people the feeling that they  aren't responsible for results. \n   But first-generation managers, by definition, are not effective people.  They  produce very little, and \ntheir life-style does nothing to build their Production  Capability.  Buffeted by outside forces, they are \noften seen as undependable and irresponsible, and they  have very little sense of control and self-esteem. \n   Second-generation managers assume a little more  control.  They plan an d schedule in advance and \ngenerally are seen as more responsible beca use they \"show up\" when they're supposed to. \n   But again, the activities they schedule have no priority or recognized correlation to deeper values \nand goals.  They have few significant achi evements and tend to be schedule-oriented. \n   Third-generation managers take a significant step forward.  They clarify their values and set goals.  \nThey plan each day and pr ioritize their activities. \n   As I have said, this is where most of the time-m anagement field is today.  But this third generation \nhas some critical limitations.  First, it limits vision  -- daily planning often misses important things that \ncan only be seen from a larger perspective.  The ve ry language \"daily planning\" focuses on the urgent \n-- the \"now.\"  While third generation prioritization pr ovides order to activity, it doesn't question the \nessential importance of the activity",

Buffeted by outside forces, they are \noften seen as undependable and irresponsible, and they  have very little sense of control and self-esteem. \n   Second-generation managers assume a little more  control.

They clarify their values and set goals.  \nThey plan each day and pr ioritize their activities. \n   As I have said, this is where most of the time-m anagement field is today.

The ve ry language \"daily planning\" focuses on the urgent \n-- the \"now.\"  While third generation prioritization pr ovides order to activity, it doesn't question the \nessential importance of the activity in the first plac e -- it doesn't place the activity in the context of \nprinciples, personal mission, role s, and goals.  The third-generat ion value-driven daily planning \napproach basically prioritizes the Quadrant I and III problems and crises of the day. \n   In addition, the third generation makes no provisio n for managing roles in a balanced way.  It lacks \nrealism, creating the tendency to over-schedule th e day, resulting in frustration and the desire to \noccasionally throw away the plan and escape to Quadrant  IV.  And its e fficiency, time-management \nfocus tends to strain relation ships rather than build them. \n   While each of the three generations has recogn ized the value of some kind of management tool, \nnone has produced a tool that em powers a person to live a principle- centered, Quadrant II life-style.  \nThe first-generation note pads and \"to do\" lists give us no more than a place to capture those things that \npenetrate our awareness so we won't forget them .  The second-generation appointment books and \ncalendars merely provide a place to record our fu ture commitments so that  we can be where we have \nagreed to be at the appropriate time.    Even the third generation, with its vast array of  planners and materials, focuses primarily on helping \npeople prioritize and plan their Quadrant I and III ac tivities.  Though many trainers and consultants \nrecognize the value of Quadrant II activities, the actu al planning tools of the third generation do not \nfacilitate organizing and executing around them.    As each generation builds on those that have prec eded it, the strengths and some of the tools of each \nof the first three generations provide elemental materi al for the fourth.  But there is an added need for \na new dimension, for the paradigm and the implem entation that will empo w e r  u s  t o  m o v e  i n t o  \nQuadrant II, to become principle-centered and to mana ge ourselves to do what is truly most important. \n The Quadrant II Tool     The objective of Quadrant II management is to ma",

    "text": " nage our lives effectively -- from a center of sound \nprinciples, for a knowledge of our pe rsonal mission, with a focus on th e important as well as the urgent, \nand within the framework of mainta ining a balance between increasing  our Production and increasing \nour Production Capability    This is, admittedly, an ambitious objective for peop le caught in the thick of thin things in Quadrants \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \nIII and IV.  But striving to achieve it will have a phenomenal impact on personal effectiveness. \n   A Quadrant II organizer will need  to meet six important criteria. \n   Coherence:  Coherence suggests that there is harmony, unity, and integrity between your vision \nand mission, your roles and goals, your priorities an d plans, and your desires and discipline.  In your \nplanner, there should be a place for your personal mi ssion statement so that yo u can constantly refer to \nit.  There also needs to be a place for your roles and for both short- and long-term goals. \n   Balance:  Your tool should help you to keep ba lance in your life, to identify your various roles and \nkeep them right in front of you, so that you don' t neglect important areas such as your health, your \nfamily, professional preparation, or personal development.    Many people seem to think that success in one are a can compensate for failure in other areas of life.  \nBut can it really?  Perhaps it can for a limited time  in some areas.  But can success in your profession \ncompensate for a broken marriage, ruined heal th, or weakness in personal character?  True \neffectiveness requires balance, and your tool  needs to help you create and maintain it. \n   Quadrant II Focus:.  You need a tool that encou rages you, motivates you, actually helps you spend \nthe time you need in Quadrant II, so that you're dealin g with prevention rather than prioritizing crises.  \nIn my opinion, the best way to do this is to orga nize your life on a weekly basis.  You can still adapt \nand prioritize on a daily basis, but the fundamental thrust is organizing the week. \n   Organizing on a weekly basis provides much greater balance and context than daily planning.  \nThere seems to be implicit cultural recognition of the week as a single, complete unit of time.  Business, \neducation, and many other facets of society ope rate within the framework of the week, designating \ncertain days for focused investment and others for re laxation or inspiration.  The basic Judeo-Christian \nethic honors the Sabbath, the one day out of every seven set aside for uplifting purposes. \n   Most people think in terms of weeks.  But mo st third-generation planning tools focus on daily \nplanning.  While they may help you prioritize your activities, they basically only help you organize \ncrises and busywork.  The key is not to prioritize  what's on your schedul e, but to schedule your \npriorities.  And this can best be  done in the context of the week. \n   A \"People\" Dimension:  You also need a tool th at deals with people, not just schedules.  While you \ncan think in terms of efficiency in dealing with ti me, a principle-centered person thinks in terms of \neffectiveness in dealing with pe ople.  There are times when principle-centered Quadrant II living \nrequires the subordination of schedul es to people.  Your tool needs to  reflect that value, to facilitate \nimplementation rather than create gu ilt when a schedule is not followed. \n   Flexibility:  Your planning tool should be your  servant, never your master.  Since it has to work \nfor you, it should be tailored to your style, your needs, your particular ways.    Portability:  Your tool should also be portable, so that you can carry it with you most of the time.  \nYou may want to review your personal mission stat ement while riding the bus.  You may want to \nmeasure the value of a new opportunity against so mething you already have planned.  If  your \norganizer is portable, you will keep it with you so  that important data is always within reach. \n   Since Quadrant II is the heart of effective self -management, you need a t ool that moves you into \nQuadrant II.  My work with the fourth-generation conc ept has led to the creation of a tool specifically \ndesigned according to the criteria listed above. ",

    "text": " you need in Quadrant II, so that you're dealin g with prevention rather than prioritizing crises.  \nIn my opinion, the best way to do this is to orga nize your life on a weekly basis.  You can still adapt \nand prioritize on a daily basis, but the fundamental thrust is organizing the week. \n   Organizing on a weekly basis provides much greater balance and context than daily planning.  \nThere seems to be implicit cultural recognition of the week as a single, complete unit of time.  Business, \neducation, and many other facets of society ope rate within the framework of the week, designating \ncertain days for focused investment and others for re laxation or inspiration.  The basic Judeo-Christian \nethic honors the Sabbath, the one day out of every seven set aside for uplifting purposes. \n   Most people think in terms of weeks.  But mo st third-generation planning tools focus on daily \nplanning.  While they may help you prioritize your activities, they basically only help you organize \ncrises and busywork.  The key is not to prioritize  what's on your schedul e, but to schedule your \npriorities.  And this can best be  done in the context of the week. \n   A \"People\" Dimension:  You also need a tool th at deals with people, not just schedules.  While you \ncan think in terms of efficiency in dealing with ti me, a principle-centered person thinks in terms of \neffectiveness in dealing with pe ople.  There are times when principle-centered Quadrant II living \nrequires the subordination of schedul es to people.  Your tool needs to  reflect that value, to facilitate \nimplementation rather than create gu ilt when a schedule is not followed. \n   Flexibility:  Your planning tool should be your  servant, never your master.  Since it has to work \nfor you, it should be tailored to your style, your needs, your particular ways.    Portability:  Your tool should also be portable, so that you can carry it with you most of the time.  \nYou may want to review your personal mission stat ement while riding the bus.  You may want to \nmeasure the value of a new opportunity against so mething you already have planned.  If  your \norganizer is portable, you will keep it with you so  that important data is always within reach. \n   Since Quadrant II is the heart of effective",

Since it has to work \nfor you, it should be tailored to your style, your needs, your particular ways.

    "text": " self -management, you need a t ool that moves you into \nQuadrant II.  My work with the fourth-generation conc ept has led to the creation of a tool specifically \ndesigned according to the criteria listed above.  But many good third-generation tools can easily be \nadapted.  Because the principles are sound, the prac tices or specific applications can vary from one \nindividual to the next.  Becoming a Quadrant II Self-Manager     Although my effort here is to teach principles, not practices, of effectiveness, I believe you can better \nunderstand the principles and th e empowering nature of the fourth generation if you actually \nexperience organizing a week from a principle-centered, Quadrant II base. \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n   Quadrant II organizing involves four key activities. \n   Identifying Roles:  The first task is to write down your key roles.  If you haven't really given \nserious thought to the roles in your life, you can write down what immediately comes to mind.  You \nhave a role as an individual.  You may want to lis t one or more roles as a family member -- a husband \nor wife, mother or father, son or daughter, a member  of the extended family of grandparents, aunts, \nuncles, and cousins.  You may want to list a few role s in your work, indicating different areas in which \nyou wish to invest time and energy on a regular ba sis.  You may have roles in church or community \naffairs.    You don't need to worry about defining the roles in  a way that you will live wi th for the rest of your \nlife -- just consider the week and write down the areas  you see yourself spending time in during the \nnext seven days.    Here are two examples of the way people might see their various roles.    1. Individual    2. Husband/Father    3. Manager New Products    4. Manager Research    5. Manager Staff Dev.    6. Manager Administration    7. Chairman United Way     1. Personal Development    2. Wife    3. Mother    4. Real Estate Salesperson    5. Sunday School Teacher    6. Symphony Board Member     Selecting Goals:  The next step is to think of  two or three important results you feel you should \naccomplish in each role during the next seven days.  These would be recorded as goals.    At least some of these goals should reflect Qu adrant II activities.  Ideally, these short-term goals \nwould be tied to the longer-term goals you have iden tified in conjunction with  your personal mission \nstatement.  But even if you haven't written your mi ssion statement, you can get a feeling, a sense, of \nwhat is important as you consider each of yo ur roles and two or three goals for each role. \n   Scheduling:  Now you look at the week ahead with your goals in mind and schedule time to \nachieve them.  For example, if your goal is to produce the first draft of your personal mission \nstatement, you may want to set aside a two-hour bloc k of time on Sunday to work on it.  Sunday (or \nsome other day of the week that is special to you, yo ur faith, or your circumst ances) is often the ideal \ntime to plan your more personally uplifting activities , including weekly organizing.  It's a good time to \ndraw back, to see inspiration, to look at your  life in the context of principles and values. \n   If you set a goal to become physically fit through exercise, you may want to set aside an hour three or four days during the week, or possibly every day during the week, to accomplish that goal.  There \nare some goals that you may only be able to acco mplish during business hours, or some that you can \nonly do on Saturday when your children are home.  Can you begin to see some of the advantages of \norganizing the week instead of the day?    Having identified roles and set goals, you can tran slate each goal to a specif ic day of the week, either \nas a priority item or, even better, as a specific a ppointment.  You can also check your annual or \nmonthly calendar for any appointments you may have previously made and evaluate their importance \nin the context of your goals, transferring those you decide to keep to your schedule and making plans to \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G",

My work with the fourth-generation conc ept has led to the creation of a tool specifically \ndesigned according to the criteria listed above.  But many good third-generation tools can easily be \nadapted.  Because the principles are sound, the prac tices or specific applications can vary from one \nindividual to the next.  Becoming a Quadrant II Self-Manager     Although my effort here is to teach principles, not practices, of effectiveness, I believe you can better \nunderstand the principles and th e empowering nature of the fourth generation if you actually \nexperience organizing a week from a principle-centered, Quadrant II base. \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n   Quadrant II organizing involves four key activities. \n   Identifying Roles:  The first task is to write down your key roles.  If you haven't really given \nserious thought to the roles in your life, you can write down what immediately comes to mind.  You \nhave a role as an individual.  You may want to lis t one or more roles as a family member -- a husband \nor wife, mother or father, son or daughter, a member  of the extended family of grandparents, aunts, \nuncles, and cousins.  You may want to list a few role s in your work, indicating different areas in which \nyou wish to invest time and energy on a regular ba sis.  You may have roles in church or community \naffairs.

If you haven't really given \nserious thought to the roles in your life, you can write down what immediately comes to mind.  You \nhave a role as an individual.  You may want to lis t one or more roles as a family member -- a husband \nor wife, mother or father, son or daughter, a member  of the extended family of grandparents, aunts, \nuncles, and cousins.  You may want to list a few role s in your work, indicating different areas in which \nyou wish to invest time and energy on a regular ba sis.  You may have roles in church or community \naffairs.    You don't need to worry about defining the roles in  a way that you will live wi th for the rest of your \nlife -- just consider the week and write down the areas  you see yourself spending time in during the \nnext seven days.    Here are two examples of the way people might see their various roles.    1. Individual    2. Husband/Father",

Symphony Board Member     Selecting Goals:  The next step is to think of  two or three important results you feel you should \naccomplish in each role during the next seven days.  These would be recorded as goals.    At least some of these goals should reflect Qu adrant II activities.  Ideally, these short-term goals \nwould be tied to the longer-term goals you have iden tified in conjunction with  your personal mission \nstatement.  But even if you haven't written your mi ssion statement, you can get a feeling, a sense, of \nwhat is important as you consider each of yo ur roles and two or three goals for each role. \n   Scheduling:  Now you look at the week ahead with your goals in mind and schedule time to \nachieve them.  For example, if your goal is to produce the first draft of your personal mission \nstatement, you may want to set aside a two-hour bloc k of time on Sunday to work on it.  Sunday (or \nsome other day of the week that is special to you, yo ur faith, or your circumst ances) is often the ideal \ntime to plan your more personally uplifting activities , including weekly organizing.  It's a good time to \ndraw back, to see inspiration, to look at your  life in the context of principles and values. \n   If you set a goal to become physically fit through exercise, you may want to set aside an hour three or four days during the week, or possibly every day during the week, to accomplish that goal.  There \nare some goals that you may only be able to acco mplish during business hours, or some that you can \nonly do on Saturday when your children are home.  Can you begin to see some of the advantages of \norganizing the week instead of the day?    Having identified roles and set goals, you can tran slate each goal to a specif ic day of the week, either \nas a priority item or, even better, as a specific a ppointment.  You can also check your annual or \nmonthly calendar for any appointments you may have previously",

In addition, notice the \nbox labeled \"Sharpen the Saw TM\" that provides a plac e to plan vital renewing Quadrant II activities in \neach of the four human dimensions that will be explained in Habit 7.    Even with time set aside to accomplish 19 impo rtant goals during the week , look at the amount of \nremaining unscheduled space on the worksheet!  As well as empowering you to Put First Things First, \nQuadrant II weekly organizing gives you the freedom and the flexibility to handle unanticipated events, \nto shift appointments if you need to, to savor relati onships and interactions with  others, to deeply enjoy \nspontaneous experiences, knowing that you have proactively organized your week to accomplish key \ngoals in every area of your life.    Daily Adapting:  With Quadrant II weekly orga nizing, daily planning becomes more a function of \ndaily adapting, or prioritizing activities and resp onding to unanticipated events, relationships, and \nexperiences in a meaningful way.    Taking a few minutes each morning to revi ew your schedule can put you in touch with the \nvalue-based decisions you made as you organized th e week as well as unanticipated factors that may \nhave come up.  As you overview the day, you can see that your roles and goals provide a natural prioritization that grows out of your innate sense of balance.  It is a softer, more right-brain \nprioritization that ultimately comes ou t of your sense of personal mission. \n   You may still find that the third-generation A, B, C or 1, 2, 3 prioritizat ion gives needed order to \ndaily activities.  It would be a false dichotomy to say that activities are either important or they aren't.  \nThey are obviously on a continuum, and some importan t activities are more impo rtant than others.  In \nthe context of weekly organizing, third-generatio n prioritization gives order to daily focus. \n   But trying to prioritize activities before you ev en know how they relate to your sense of personal \nmission and how they fit into the balance of your lif e is not effective.  You may be prioritizing and \naccomplishing things you don't want  or need to be doing at all. \n   Can you begin to see the difference between organizing your week as a principle-centered, \nQuadrant II manager and planning your days as an individual centered on something else?  Can you \nbegin to sense the tremendous difference the Quadran t II focus would make in your current level of \neffectiveness?    Having experienced the power of principle-ce ntered Quadrant II organizing in my own life and \nhaving seen it transform the lives of hundreds of ot her people, I am persuaded it makes a difference -- a \nquantum positive difference.  And the more comple tely weekly goals are tied into a wider framework \nof correct principles and into a personal mission stat ement, the greater the increase in effectiveness will \nbe.  Living It     Returning once more to the computer metapho r, if Habit 1 says \"You're the programmer\" and Habit \n2 says \"Write the program,\" then Habit 3 says \"Run the program,\" \"Live the program.\"  And living it is \nprimarily a function of our independent will, our sel f-discipline, our integrity, and commitment -- not to \nshort-term goals and schedules or to the impulse of  the moment, but to the correct principles and our \nown deepest values, which give meaning and cont ext to our goals, our schedules, and our lives. \n   As you go through your week, there will undoub tedly be times when your integrity will be placed \non the line.  The popularity of reacting to the urge nt but unimportant priorities of other people in \nQuadrant III or the pleasure of escaping to Quad rant IV will threaten to overpower the important \nQuadrant II activities you have planned.  Your principle center, your self-awareness, and your conscience can provide a high degree of intrinsic security, guidance, and wisdom to empower you to \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H",

Taking a few minutes each morning to revi ew your schedule can put you in touch with the \nvalue-based decisions you made as you organized th e week as well as unanticipated factors that may \nhave come up.  As you overview the day, you can see that your roles and goals provide a natural prioritization that grows out of your innate sense of balance.  It is a softer, more right-brain \nprioritization that ultimately comes ou t of your sense of personal mission. \n   You may still find that the third-generation A, B, C or 1, 2, 3 prioritizat ion gives needed order to \ndaily activities.

As well as empowering you to Put First Things First, \nQuadrant II weekly organizing gives you the freedom and the flexibility to handle unanticipated events, \nto shift appointments if you need to, to savor relati onships and interactions with  others, to deeply enjoy \nspontaneous experiences, knowing that you have proactively organized your week to accomplish key \ngoals in every area of your life.    Daily Adapting:  With Quadrant II weekly orga nizing, daily planning becomes more a function of \ndaily adapting, or prioritizing activities and resp onding to unanticipated events, relationships, and \nexperiences in a meaningful way.    Taking a few minutes each morning to revi ew your schedule can put you in touch with the \nvalue-based decisions you made as you organized th e week as well as unanticipated factors that may \nhave come up.  As you overview the day, you can see that your roles and goals provide a natural prioritization that grows out of your innate sense of balance.  It is a softer, more right-brain \nprioritization that ultimately comes ou t of your sense of personal mission.",

It would be a false dichotomy to say that activities are either important or they aren't.  \nThey are obviously on a continuum, and some importan t activities are more impo rtant than others.  In \nthe context of weekly organizing, third-generatio n prioritization gives order to daily focus. \n   But trying to prioritize activities before you ev en know how they relate to your sense of personal \nmission and how they fit into the balance of your lif e is not effective.  You may be prioritizing and \naccomplishing things you don't want  or need to be doing at all. \n   Can you begin to see the difference between organizing your week as a principle-centered, \nQuadrant II manager and planning your days as an individual centered on something else?  Can you \nbegin to sense the tremendous difference the Quadran t II focus would make in your current level of \neffectiveness?    Having experienced the power of principle-ce ntered Quadrant II organizing in my own life and \nhaving seen it transform the lives of hundreds of ot her people, I am persuaded it makes a difference -- a \nquantum positive difference.  And the more comple tely weekly goals are tied into a wider framework \nof correct principles and into a personal mission stat ement, the greater the increase in effectiveness will \nbe.

The popularity of reacting to the urge nt but unimportant priorities of other people in \nQuadrant III or the pleasure of escaping to Quad rant IV will threaten to overpower the important \nQuadrant II activities you have planned.

Having experienced the power of principle-ce ntered Quadrant II organizing in my own life and \nhaving seen it transform the lives of hundreds of ot her people, I am persuaded it makes a difference -- a \nquantum positive difference.  And the more comple tely weekly goals are tied into a wider framework \nof correct principles and into a personal mission stat ement, the greater the increase in effectiveness will \nbe.  Living It     Returning once more to the computer metapho r, if Habit 1 says \"You're the programmer\" and Habit \n2 says \"Write the program,\" then Habit 3 says \"Run the program,\" \"Live the program.\"  And living it is \nprimarily a function of our independent will, our sel f-discipline, our integrity, and commitment -- not to \nshort-term goals and schedules or to the impulse of  the moment, but to the correct principles and our \nown deepest values, which give meaning and cont ext to our goals, our schedules, and our lives. \n   As you go through your week, there will undoub tedly be times when your integrity will be placed \non the line",

    "text": " principle center, your self-awareness, and your conscience can provide a high degree of intrinsic security, guidance, and wisdom to empower you to \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \nuse your independent will and maintain  integrity to the truly important. \n   But because you aren't omniscient, you can't alwa ys know in advance what is truly important.  As \ncarefully as you organize the week, these will be ti mes when, as a principle-centered person, you will \nneed to subordinate your schedule to a higher valu e.  Because you are principle-centered, you can do \nthat with an inner sense of peace.    At one point, one of my sons was deeply into  scheduling and efficiency.  One day he had a very \ntight schedule, which included do wn-to-the-minute time allocations for every activity, including \npicking up some books, washing his car, and \"dropping\" Carol, his girlfriend, among other things. \n   Everything went according to sch edule until it came to Carol.  They had been dating for a long \nperiod of time, and he had finally come to the conc lusion that a continued re lationship would not work \nout.  So, congruent with his efficiency mode, he ha d scheduled a 10- to 15-minute telephone call to tell \nher.    But the news was very traumatic to her.  One-an d-a-half hours later, he was still deeply involved in \na very intense conversation with her.  Even then, the one visit was not enough.  The situation was a \nvery frustrating experience for them both.    Again, you simply can't think efficiency with  people.  You think effect iveness with people and \nefficiency with things.  I've tried to be \"efficien t\" with a disagreeing or disagreeable person and it \nsimply doesn't work.  I've tried to give 10 minutes of \"quality time\" to a child or an employee to solve a \nproblem, only to discover such \"efficiency\" crea tes new problems and seldom resolves the deepest \nconcern.    I see many parents, particularly mothers with sm all children, often frustrated in their desire to \naccomplish a lot because all they seem to do is meet  the needs of little children all day.  Remember, \nfrustration is a function of our expectations, and our expectations are often a reflection of the social \nmirror rather than our own values and priorities.    But if you have Habit 2 deep inside your heart and mind, you have those higher values driving you.  You can subordinate your schedule to those values with  integrity.  You can adapt; you can be flexible.  \nYou don't feel guilty when you don't meet your  schedule or when you have to change it. \n Advances of the Fourth Generation     One of the reasons why people resist using thir d-generation time management tools is because they \nlose spontaneity; they become rigid and inflexible.  They subordinate people to schedules because the \nefficiency paradigm of the third generation of manage ment is out of harmony with the principle that \npeople are more important than things.    The fourth-generation tool recogn izes that principle.  It also re cognizes that the first person you \nneed to consider in terms of effect iveness rather than efficiency is your self.  It encourages you to spend \ntime in Quadrant II, to understand and center your li fe on principles, to give clear expression to the \npurposes and values you want to direct your daily deci sions.  It helps you create balance in your life.  \nIt helps you rise above the limitations of daily plan ning and organize and schedule in the context of the \nweek.  And when a higher value conf licts with what you have planne d, it empowers you to use your \nself-awareness and your conscience to maintain in tegrity to the principles and purposes you have \ndetermined are most important.  Instead of  using a road map, you're using a compass. \n   The fourth generation of self-management is more  advanced than the third in five important ways. \n   First, it's principle-centered.  More than givi ng lip service to Quadrant II, it creates the central \nparadigm that empowers you to see your time in the context of what is really important and effective \n   Second,  it's conscience-directed.  It gives you the opportunity to organize your life to the best of \nyour ability in harmony with your deepest values.  But it also gives you the freedom to peacefully \nsubordinate your schedule to higher values. \n",

    "text": "10 minutes of \"quality time\" to a child or an employee to solve a \nproblem, only to discover such \"efficiency\" crea tes new problems and seldom resolves the deepest \nconcern.    I see many parents, particularly mothers with sm all children, often frustrated in their desire to \naccomplish a lot because all they seem to do is meet  the needs of little children all day.  Remember, \nfrustration is a function of our expectations, and our expectations are often a reflection of the social \nmirror rather than our own values and priorities.    But if you have Habit 2 deep inside your heart and mind, you have those higher values driving you.  You can subordinate your schedule to those values with  integrity.  You can adapt; you can be flexible.  \nYou don't feel guilty when you don't meet your  schedule or when you have to change it. \n Advances of the Fourth Generation     One of the reasons why people resist using thir d-generation time management tools is because they \nlose spontaneity; they become rigid and inflexible.  They subordinate people to schedules because the \nefficiency paradigm of the third generation of manage ment is out of harmony with the principle that \npeople are more important than things.    The fourth-generation tool recogn izes that principle.  It also re cognizes that the first person you \nneed to consider in terms of effect iveness rather than efficiency is your self.  It encourages you to spend \ntime in Quadrant II, to understand and center your li fe on principles, to give clear expression to the \npurposes and values you want to direct your daily deci sions.  It helps you create balance in your life.  \nIt helps you rise above the limitations of daily plan ning and organize and schedule in the context of the \nweek.  And when a higher value conf licts with what you have planne d, it empowers you to use your \nself-awareness and your conscience to maintain in tegrity to the principles and purposes you have \ndetermined are most important.  Instead of  using a road map, you're using a compass. \n   The fourth generation of self-management is more  advanced than the third in five important ways. \n   First, it's principle-centered.  More than givi ng lip service to Quadrant II, it creates the central \nparadigm that empowers you to see your time in the context of what is really important and effective \n   Second,",

    "text": "10 minutes of \"quality time\" to a child or an employee to solve a \nproblem, only to discover such \"efficiency\" crea tes new problems and seldom resolves the deepest \nconcern.    I see many parents, particularly mothers with sm all children, often frustrated in their desire to \naccomplish a lot because all they seem to do is meet  the needs of little children all day.  Remember, \nfrustration is a function of our expectations, and our expectations are often a reflection of the social \nmirror rather than our own values and priorities.    But if you have Habit 2 deep inside your heart and mind, you have those higher values driving you.  You can subordinate your schedule to those values with  integrity.  You can adapt; you can be flexible.  \nYou don't feel guilty when you don't meet your  schedule or when you have to change it. \n Advances of the Fourth Generation     One of the reasons why people resist using thir d-generation time management tools is because they \nlose spontaneity; they become rigid and inflexible.  They subordinate people to schedules because the \nefficiency paradigm of the third generation of manage ment is out of harmony with the principle that \npeople are more important than things",

    "text": " is because they \nlose spontaneity; they become rigid and inflexible.  They subordinate people to schedules because the \nefficiency paradigm of the third generation of manage ment is out of harmony with the principle that \npeople are more important than things.    The fourth-generation tool recogn izes that principle.  It also re cognizes that the first person you \nneed to consider in terms of effect iveness rather than efficiency is your self.  It encourages you to spend \ntime in Quadrant II, to understand and center your li fe on principles, to give clear expression to the \npurposes and values you want to direct your daily deci sions.  It helps you create balance in your life.  \nIt helps you rise above the limitations of daily plan ning and organize and schedule in the context of the \nweek.  And when a higher value conf licts with what you have planne d, it empowers you to use your \nself-awareness and your conscience to maintain in tegrity to the principles and purposes you have \ndetermined are most important.  Instead of  using a road map, you're using a compass. \n   The fourth generation of self-management is more  advanced than the third in five important ways. \n  ",

But it also gives you the freedom to peacefully \nsubordinate your schedule to higher values. \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n   Third, it defines your unique mission, includin g values and long-term goals.  This gives direction \nand purpose to the way you spend each day.    Fourth, it helps you balance your life by iden tifying roles, and by se tting goals and scheduling \nactivities in each key role every week.    And fifth, it gives greater context through week ly organizing (with daily adaptation as needed), \nrising above the limiting perspective of a single day and putting you in touch with your deepest values \nthrough review of your key roles.    The practical thread running through all five of  these advances is a primary focus on relationships \nand results and a secondary focus on time.  Delegation:  Increasing P and PC     We accomplish all that we do through delegation -- either to time or to other people.  If  we \ndelegate to time, we think efficiency.  If we de legate to other people, we think effectiveness. \n   Many people refuse to delegate to other people because they feel it takes too much time and effort \nand they could do the job better themselves.  But effe ctively delegating to others is perhaps the single \nmost powerful high-leverage activity there is.    Transferring responsibility to other skilled and t rained people enables you to give your energies to \nother high-leverage activities.  Delegation means gr owth, both for individuals and for organizations.  \nThe late J. C. Penney was quoted as saying that the wisest decision he ever ma de was to \"let go\" after \nrealizing that he couldn't do it all by himself any longer.  That decision, made long ago, enabled the \ndevelopment and growth of hundreds of stores and thousands of people. \n   Because delegation involves other people, it is a Public Victory and could well be included in Habit \n4.  But because we are focusing here on principles of personal management, and the ability to delegate \nto others is the main difference between the role of  manager and independent producer, I am approaching delegation from the standpoi nt of your personal managerial skills. \n   A producer does whatever is necessary to accomplish desired results, to get the golden eggs.  A parent who washes the dishes, an architect who draws up blueprints, or a secretary who types \ncorrespondence is a producer.    But when a person sets up and works with and through people and systems to produce golden eggs, \nthat person becomes a manager in the interdepende nt sense.  A parent who delegates washing the \ndishes to a child is a manager.  An architect who heads a team of other architects is a manager.  A \nsecretary who supervises other secretaries an d office personnel is an office manager. \n   A producer can invest one hour of effort and produce one unit of result s, assuming no loss of \nefficiency.    A manager, on the other hand, can invest one hour of effort and produce 10 or 50 or 100 units \nthrough effective delegation.    Management is essentially moving the fulcrum  over, and the key to effective management is \ndelegation.  Gofer Delegation     There are basically two kinds of delegation: \"gof er delegation\" and \"stewardship delegation.\"  Gofer \ndelegation means \"Go for this, go for that, do this, do  that, and tell me when it's done.\"  Most people \nwho are producers have a gofer delegation paradigm.  Remember the machete wielders in the jungle?  \nThey are the producers.  They roll up their sleeves and get the job done.

The practical thread running through all five of  these advances is a primary focus on relationships \nand results and a secondary focus on time.  Delegation:  Increasing P and PC     We accomplish all that we do through delegation -- either to time or to other people.  If  we \ndelegate to time, we think efficiency.  If we de legate to other people, we think effectiveness. \n   Many people refuse to delegate to other people because they feel it takes too much time and effort \nand they could do the job better themselves.  But effe ctively delegating to others is perhaps the single \nmost powerful high-leverage activity there is.    Transferring responsibility to other skilled and t rained people enables you to give your energies to \nother high-leverage activities.  Delegation means gr owth, both for individuals and for organizations.  \nThe late J. C. Penney was quoted as saying that the wisest decision he ever ma de was to \"let go\" after \nrealizing that he couldn't do it all by himself any longer.  That decision, made long ago",

But because we are focusing here on principles of personal management, and the ability to delegate \nto others is the main difference between the role of  manager and independent producer, I am approaching delegation from the standpoi nt of your personal managerial skills. \n   A producer does whatever is necessary to accomplish desired results, to get the golden eggs.  A parent who washes the dishes, an architect who draws up blueprints, or a secretary who types \ncorrespondence is a producer.    But when a person sets up and works with and through people and systems to produce golden eggs, \nthat person becomes a manager in the interdepende nt sense.  A parent who delegates washing the \ndishes to a child is a manager.  An architect who heads a team of other architects is a manager.  A \nsecretary who supervises other secretaries an d office personnel is an office manager. \n   A producer can invest one hour of effort and produce one unit of result s, assuming no loss of \nefficiency.    A manager, on the other hand, can invest one hour of effort and produce 10 or 50 or 100 units \nthrough effective delegation.    Management is essentially moving the fulcrum  over, and the key to effective management is \ndelegation.  Gofer Delegation     There are basically two kinds of delegation: \"gof er delegation\" and \"stewardship delegation.\"  Gofer \ndelegation means \"Go for this, go for that, do this, do  that, and tell me when it's done.\"  Most people \nwho are producers have a gofer delegation paradigm.  Remember the machete wielders in the jungle?  \nThey are the producers.  They roll up their sleeves and get the job done.  If they are given a position \nof supervision or management, they still think like producers.  They don't know how to set up a full \ndelegation so that another person is committed to  achieve results.

My son, who is an \nexcellent skier, was in the water being pulled and I was driving the boat.  I handed the camera to Sandra and asked her to take some pictures.    At first, I told her to be selective in her pictur e taking because we didn't have  much film left.  Then I \nrealized she was unfamiliar with the camera, so I became  a little more specific.  I told her to be sure to \nwait until the sun was ahead of the boat and until our son was jumping the wake or making a turn and \ntouching his elbow.    But the more I thought about our limited foot age and her inexperience with the camera, the more \nconcerned I became.  I finally said, \"Look, Sandra, ju st push the button when I tell you.  Okay?  And \nI spent the next few minutes yelling, \"Take it! -- Take it! -- Don't take it! -- Don't take it!\"  I was afraid \nthat if I didn't direct her every move ev ery second, it wouldn't be done right. \n   That was true gofer delegation, one-on-one su pervision of methods.  Many people consistently \ndelegate that way.  But how much does it really a ccomplish?  And how many people is it possible to \nsupervise or manage when you have to be involved in every move they make? \n   There's a much better way, a more effective way to delegate to other people.  And it's based on a \nparadigm of appreciation of the self-awareness, th e imagination, the conscience, and the free will of \nother people.  Stewardship Delegation     Stewardship delegation is focused on results in stead of  methods.  It gives people a choice of \nmethod and makes them responsible for results.  It takes more time in the beginning, but it's time well \ninvested.  You can move the fulcr um over, you can increase your leverage, through stewardship \ndelegation.    Stewardship delegation involves clear, up-fr ont mutual understanding and commitment regarding \nexpectations in five areas.    Desired Results:  Create a clear, mutual unders tanding of what needs to be accomplished, focusing \non what, not how; results, not  methods.  Spend ti me.  Be patient.  Visualize the desired result.  \nHave the person see it, describe it, make out a quali ty statement of what the results will look like, and \nby when they will be accomplished.    Guidelines:  Identify the parameters within whic h the individual should op erate.  These should be \nas few as possible to avoid methods delegation, but should include any formidable restrictions.  You \nwon't want a person to think he had considerable la titude as long as he accomplished the objectives, \nonly to violate some long-standing traditional practice  or value.  That kills initiative and sends people \nback to the gofer's creed: \"Just tell me what you want me to do, and I'll do it.\"    If you know the failure paths of the job, identi fy them.  Be honest and open -- tell a person where \nthe quicksand is and where the wild animals are.  Yo u don't want to have to reinvent the wheel every \nday.  Let people learn from your mistakes or the mistakes of others.  Point out the potential failure \npaths, what not to do, but don't tell them what to do .  Keep the responsibility for results with them -- \nto do whatever is necessary within the guidelines.    Resources:  Identify the human, financial, te chnical, or organizational resources the person can \ndraw on to accomplish the desired results.    Accountability:  Set up the standards of performa nce that will be used in evaluating the results and \nthe specific times when reporting and evaluation will take place. \n   Consequences:  Specify what will happen, both go od and bad, as a result of the evaluation.  This \ncould include such things as financial rewards, psyc hic rewards, different job assignments, and natural \nconsequences tied into the overall mission of an organization. \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n   Some years ago, I had an interesting experien ce in delegation with one of my sons.

My son, who is an \nexcellent skier, was in the water being pulled and I was driving the boat.  I handed the camera to Sandra and asked her to take some pictures.    At first, I told her to be selective in her pictur e taking because we didn't have  much film left.  Then I \nrealized she was unfamiliar with the camera, so I became  a little more specific.  I told her to be sure to \nwait until the sun was ahead of the boat and until our son was jumping the wake or making a turn and \ntouching his elbow.    But the more I thought about our limited foot age and her inexperience with the camera, the more \nconcerned I became.  I finally said, \"Look, Sandra, ju st push the button when I tell you.  Okay?  And \nI spent the next few minutes yelling, \"Take it! -- Take it! -- Don't take it! -- Don't take it!\"  I was afraid \nthat if I didn't direct her every move ev ery second, it wouldn't be done right. \n   That was true gofer delegation, one-on-one su pervision of methods.  Many people consistently \ndelegate that way.  But how much does it really a ccomplish?  And how many people is it possible to \nsupervise or manage when you have to be involved in every move they make? \n   There's a much better way, a more effective way to delegate to other people.  And it's based on a \nparadigm of appreciation of the self-awareness, th e imagination, the conscience, and the free will of \nother people.  Stewardship Delegation     Stewardship delegation is focused on results in stead of  methods.  It gives people a choice of \nmethod and makes them responsible for results.  It takes more time in the beginning, but it's time well \ninvested.  You can move the fulcr um over, you can increase your leverage, through stewardship \ndelegation.    Stewardship delegation involves clear, up-fr ont mutual understanding and commitment regarding \nexpectations in five areas.    Desired Results:  Create a clear, mutual unders tanding of what needs",

Many people consistently \ndelegate that way.  But how much does it really a ccomplish?  And how many people is it possible to \nsupervise or manage when you have to be involved in every move they make? \n   There's a much better way, a more effective way to delegate to other people.  And it's based on a \nparadigm of appreciation of the self-awareness, th e imagination, the conscience, and the free will of \nother people.  Stewardship Delegation     Stewardship delegation is focused on results in stead of  methods.  It gives people a choice of \nmethod and makes them responsible for results.

Visualize the desired result.  \nHave the person see it, describe it, make out a quali ty statement of what the results will look like, and \nby when they will be accomplished.    Guidelines:  Identify the parameters within whic h the individual should op erate.  These should be \nas few as possible to avoid methods delegation, but should include any formidable restrictions.  You \nwon't want a person to think he had considerable la titude as long as he accomplished the objectives, \nonly to violate some long-standing traditional practice  or value.  That kills initiative and sends people \nback to the gofer's creed: \"Just tell me what you want me to do, and I'll do it.\"    If you know the failure paths of the job, identi fy them.  Be honest and open -- tell a person where \nthe quicksand is and where the wild animals are.  Yo u don't want to have to reinvent the wheel every \nday.  Let people learn from your mistakes or the mistakes of others.  Point out the potential failure \npaths, what not to do, but don't tell them what to do .  Keep the responsibility for results with them -- \nto do whatever is necessary within the guidelines.    Resources:  Identify the human, financial, te chnical, or organizational resources the person can \ndraw on to accomplish the desired results.    Accountability:  Set up the standards of performa nce that will be used in evaluating the results and \nthe specific times when reporting and evaluation will take place. \n   Consequences:  Specify what will happen, both go od and bad, as a result of the evaluation.  This \ncould include such things as financial rewards, psyc hic rewards, different job assignments, and natural \nconsequences tied into the overall mission of an organization. \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t",

Be honest and open -- tell a person where \nthe quicksand is and where the wild animals are.  Yo u don't want to have to reinvent the wheel every \nday.  Let people learn from your mistakes or the mistakes of others.  Point out the potential failure \npaths, what not to do, but don't tell them what to do .  Keep the responsibility for results with them -- \nto do whatever is necessary within the guidelines.    Resources:  Identify the human, financial, te chnical, or organizational resources the person can \ndraw on to accomplish the desired results.    Accountability:  Set up the standards of performa nce that will be used in evaluating the results and \nthe specific times when reporting and evaluation will take place. \n   Consequences:  Specify what will happen, both go od and bad, as a result of the evaluation.  This \ncould include such things as financial rewards, psyc hic rewards, different job assignments, and natural \nconsequences tied into the overall mission of an organization. \nT H E",

    "text": " o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n   Some years ago, I had an interesting experien ce in delegation with one of my sons.  We were \nhaving a family meeting, and we  had our mission statement up on the wall to make sure our plans \nwere in harmony with our values.  Everybody was there.    I set up a big blackboard and we wrote down ou r goals -- the key things we wanted to do -- and the \njobs that flowed out of those goals.  Th en I asked for volunteers to do the job. \n   \"Who wants to pay the mortgage?\" I asked.  I noticed I was the only one with my hand up. \n   \"Who wants to pay for the insu rance? The food? The cars?\"  I seem ed to have a real monopoly on \nthe opportunities.    \"Who wants to feed the new baby?\"  There was more interest here, but my wife was the only one \nwith the right qualifications for the job.    As we went down the list, jo b by job, it was soon evident that Mom and Dad had more than \nsixty-hour work weeks.  With that  paradigm in mind, some of the ot her jobs took on a more proper \nperspective.    My seven-year-old son, Stephen, volunteered to ta ke care of the yard.  Before I actually gave him a \njob, I began a thorough training process.  I wanted him to have a clear picture in his mind of what a \nwell-cared-for yard was like, so I took him next door to our neighbor's.    \"Look, son,\" I said. \"See how our neighbor's yard is green and clean?  That 's what we're after: green \nand clean.  Now come look at our yard.  See the mi xed colors?  That's not it; that's not green.  Green \nand clean is what we want.  Now how you get it green is up to you.  You're free to do it any way you \nwant, except paint it.  But I'll tell you how I'd do it if it were up to me.\" \n   \"How would you do it, Dad?\"    \"I'd turn on the sprinklers.  But you may want to use buckets or a hose.  It makes no difference to \nme.  All we care about is that the color is green.  Okay?\"    \"Okay.\"    \"Now let's talk about 'clean,' Son.  Clean means no messes around -- no pape r, strings, bones, sticks, \nor anything that messes up the place.  I'll tell you what  let's do.  Let's just clean up half of the yard \nright now and look at the difference.\"    So we got out two paper sacks and picked up one side of the yard.  \"Now look at this side.  Look \nat the other side.  See the difference?  That's called clean.\"    \"Wait!\" he called.  \"I see some paper behind that bush!\"    \"Oh, good! I didn't notice that newspape r back there.  You have good eyes, Son.\" \n   \"Now before you decide whether or not you're go ing to take the job, let me tell you a few more \nthings.  Because when you take the job, I don't do it anymore.  It's your job.  It's called a stewardship.  \nStewardship means 'a job with  a trust.' I trust you to do the job, to get it done.  Now who's going to be \nyour boss?\"    \"You, Dad?\"    \"No, not me.  You're the boss.  You boss your self.  How do you like Mom and Dad nagging you \nall the time?\"    \"I don't.\"    \"We don't like doing it either.  It sometimes caus es a bad feeling doesn't it?  So you boss yourself.  \nNow, guess who your helper is.\"    \" W h o ? \"     \"I am,\" I said.  \"You boss me.\"    \" I  d o ? \"     \"That's right.  But my time to help is limited .  Sometimes I'm away.  But when I'm here, you tell \nme how I can help.  I'll do anything you want me to do.\"    \" O k a y ! \"     \"Now guess who judges you.\" \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n   \" W",

    "text": " o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n   Some years ago, I had an interesting experien ce in delegation with one of my sons.  We were \nhaving a family meeting, and we  had our mission statement up on the wall to make sure our plans \nwere in harmony with our values.  Everybody was there.    I set up a big blackboard and we wrote down ou r goals -- the key things we wanted to do -- and the \njobs that flowed out of those goals.  Th en I asked for volunteers to do the job. \n   \"Who wants to pay the mortgage?\" I asked.  I noticed I was the only one with my hand up. \n   \"Who wants to pay for the insu rance? The food? The cars?\"  I seem ed to have a real monopoly on \nthe opportunities.    \"Who wants to feed the new baby?\"  There was more interest here, but my wife was the only one \nwith the right qualifications for the job.    As we went down the list, jo b by job, it was soon evident that Mom and Dad had more than \nsixty-hour work weeks.  With that  paradigm in mind, some of the ot her jobs took on a more proper \nperspective.    My seven-year-old son, Stephen, volunteered to ta ke care of the yard.  Before I actually gave him a \njob, I began a thorough training process.  I wanted him to have a clear picture in his mind of what a \nwell-cared-for yard was like, so I took him next door to our neighbor's.    \"Look, son,\" I said. \"See how our neighbor's yard is green and clean?  That 's what we're after: green \nand clean.  Now come look at our yard.  See the mi xed colors?  That's not it; that's not green.  Green \nand clean is what we want.  Now how you get it green is up to you.  You're free to do it any way you \nwant, except paint it.  But I'll tell you how I'd do it if it were up to me.\" \n   \"How would you do it, Dad?\"    \"I'd turn on the sprinklers.  But you may want to use buckets or a hose.  It makes no difference to \nme.  All we care about is that the color is green",

With that  paradigm in mind, some of the ot her jobs took on a more proper \nperspective.    My seven-year-old son, Stephen, volunteered to ta ke care of the yard.  Before I actually gave him a \njob, I began a thorough training process.  I wanted him to have a clear picture in his mind of what a \nwell-cared-for yard was like, so I took him next door to our neighbor's.    \"Look, son,\" I said. \"See how our neighbor's yard is green and clean?  That 's what we're after: green \nand clean.  Now come look at our yard.  See the mi xed colors?  That's not it; that's not green.  Green \nand clean is what we want.  Now how you get it green is up to you.  You're free to do it any way you \nwant, except paint it.  But I'll tell you how I'd do it if it were up to me.\" \n   \"",

Twice a week the two of us will walk around the yard and yo u can show me how it's \ncoming.  How are you going to judge?\"    \"Green and clean.\"    \" R i g h t ! \"     I trained him with those two words for two weeks befo re I felt he was ready to take the job.  Finally, \nthe big day came.    \"Is it a deal, Son?\"    \"It's a deal.\"    \"What's the job?\"    \"Green and clean.\"    \"What's green?\"    He looked at our yard, which was beginning to look better.  Then he pointed next door.  \"That's \nthe color of his yard.\"    \"What's clean?\"    \"No messes.\"    \"Who's the boss?\"    \"I am.\"    \"Who's your helper?\"    \"You are, when you have time.\"    \"Who's the judge?\"    \"I am.  We'll walk around two times a week and I can show you how it's coming.\"    \"And what will we look for?\"    \"Green and clean.\"    At that time I didn't mention an allowance.  But I wouldn't hesitate to attach an allowance to such a \nstewardship.    Two weeks and two words.  I thought he was ready.    It was Saturday.  And he did nothing.  Sund ay...nothing.  Monday...nothing.  As I pulled out of \nthe driveway on my way to work on Tuesday, I look ed at the yellow, cluttered yard and the hot July \nsun on its way up.  \"Surely he'll do it today,\" I thought.  I could rationalize Saturday because that was the day we made the agreement.  I could rationali ze Sunday; Sunday was for other things.  But I \ncouldn't rationalize Monday.  And now it was Tuesday.  Certainly he'd do it today.  It was \nsummertime.  What else did he have to do?    All day I could hardly wait to return home to  see what happened.  As I rounded the corner, I was \nmet with the same picture I left that morning.  And there was my son at th e park across the street \nplaying.    This was not acceptable.  I was upset and di sillusioned by his performance after two weeks of \ntraining and all those commitments.  We had a lot of effort, pride, and money invested in the yard and \nI could see it going down the drain.  Besides, my  neighbor's yard was manicured and beautiful, and \nthe situation was beginning to get embarrassing.    I was ready to go back to gofer delegation.  So n, you get over here and pick up this garbage right \nnow or else!  I knew I could get the golden egg that  way.  But what about the goose?  What would \nhappen to his internal commitment?    So I faked a smile and yelled across the street, \"Hi, Son.  How's it going?\"    \"Fine!\" he returned.    \"How's the yard coming?\" I knew the minute I sa id it I had broken our ag reement.  That's not the \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \nway we had set up an accounting.  That's not what we had agreed. \n   \"How's the yard coming?\" I knew the minute I sa id it I had broken our ag reement.  That's not the \nway we had set up an accounting.  That's not what we had agreed.    So he felt justified in breaking it, too.  \"Fine, Dad.\"    I bit my tongue and waited until after dinner.  Th en I said, \"Son, let's do as we agreed.  Let's walk \naround the yard together and you can show me how it's going in your stewardship.\" \n   As we started out the door, his chin began to quiv er.  Tears  welled up in his eyes and, by the time \nwe got out to the middle of the yard, he was whimpering.    \"It's so hard, Dad!\"    What's so hard?  I thought to myself. ",

Then he pointed next door.  \"That's \nthe color of his yard.\"    \"What's clean?\"    \"No messes.\"    \"Who's the boss?\"    \"I am.\"    \"Who's your helper?\"    \"You are, when you have time.\"    \"Who's the judge?\"    \"I am.  We'll walk around two times a week and I can show you how it's coming.\"    \"And what will we look for?\"    \"Green and clean.\"    At that time I didn't mention an allowance.  But I wouldn't hesitate to attach an allowance to such a \nstewardship.    Two weeks and two words.  I thought he was ready.    It was Saturday.  And he did nothing.  Sund ay...nothing.  Monday...nothing.  As I pulled out of \nthe driveway on my way to work on Tuesday, I look ed at the yellow, cluttered yard and the hot July \nsun on its way up.  \"Surely he'll do it today,\" I thought.  I could rationalize Saturday because that was the day we made the agreement.  I could rationali ze Sunday; Sunday was for other things.  But I \ncouldn't rationalize Monday.  And now it was Tuesday.  Certainly he'd do it today.  It was \nsummertime.  What else did he have to do?    All day I could hardly wait to return home to  see what happened",

And there was my son at th e park across the street \nplaying.    This was not acceptable.  I was upset and di sillusioned by his performance after two weeks of \ntraining and all those commitments.  We had a lot of effort, pride, and money invested in the yard and \nI could see it going down the drain.  Besides, my  neighbor's yard was manicured and beautiful, and \nthe situation was beginning to get embarrassing.    I was ready to go back to gofer delegation.

You haven't done a single thing!  But I knew what was \nhard -- self management, self-supervision.  So I said, \"Is there anything I can do to help?\" \n   \"Would you, Dad?\" he sniffed    \"What was our agreement?\"    \"You said you'd help me if you had time.\"    \"I have time.\"    So he ran into the house and came back with tw o sacks.  He handed me one.  \"Will you pick that \nstuff up?\"  He pointed to the garbage from Satu rday night's barbecue.  \"It makes me sick!\" \n   So I did.  I did exactly what he asked me to do.  And that was when he  signed the agreement in \nhis heart.  It became his yard, his stewardship.    He only asked for help two or three more times th at entire summer.  He took  care of that yard.  He \nkept it greener and cleaner than it had ever been under my steward ship.  He even reprimanded his \nbrothers and sisters if they left so  much as a gum wrapper on the lawn. \n   Trust is the highest form of human motivation.  It  brings out the very best in people.  But it takes \ntime and patience, and it doesn't preclude the ne cessity to train and develop people so that their \ncompetency can rise to the level of that trust.    I am convinced that if stewardship delegation  is done correctly, both parties will benefit and \nultimately much more work will ge t done in much less time.  I believe that a family that is well \norganized, whose time has been spent effectively de legating on a one-to-one basis, can organize the \nwork so that everyone can do everything in about an hour a day.  But that takes the internal capacity \nto want to manage, not just produce.  The focus is on effectiveness, not efficiency. \n   Certainly you can pick up that room better than  a child, but the key is that you want to empower the \nchild to do it.  It takes time.  You have to get invo lved in the training and development.  It takes time, \nbut how valuable that time is downstream!  It saves you so much in the long run. \n   This approach involves an entirely new paradigm of delegation.  In effect, it changes the nature of \nthe relationship:  The steward  becomes his own bo ss, governed by a conscience that contains the \ncommitment to agreed upon desired results.  But it also releases his creative energies toward doing \nwhatever is necessary in harmony with correct principles to achieve those desired results. \n   The  principles involved in stewardship delegati on are correct and applicable  to any kind of person \nor situation.  With immature people, you specify fewer desired results and more guidelines, identify \nmore resources, conduct more frequent accoun tability interviews, and apply more immediate \nconsequences.  With more mature people, you have more challenging desired results, fewer guidelines, \nless frequent accountability, and less meas urable but more discernible criteria. \n   Effective delegation is perhaps the best indicato r of effective management simply because it is so \nbasic to both personal and organizational growth.  The Quadrant II Paradigm     The key to effective management of self, or of others through delegation, is not in any technique or \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \ntool or extrinsic factor.  It is intrinsic -- in the Quadrant II paradig m that empowers you to see through \nthe lens of importance rather than urgency.    I have included in the Appendix an exercise  called \"A Quadrant II Day at the Office\" which will \nenable you to see in a business se tting how powerfully this paradigm can impact your effectiveness. \n   As you work to develop a Quadrant II paradigm,  you will increase your ability to organize and \nexecute every week of your life around your deepest priorities, to walk your talk.  You will not be \ndependent on any other person or thing fo r the effective management of your life. \n   Interestingly, every one of the Seven Habits is  in Quadrant II.  Every one deals with fundamentally \nimportant things that, if done on a regular basis, would make a tremendous positive difference in our \nlives.  Application Suggestions",

You haven't done a single thing!  But I knew what was \nhard -- self management, self-supervision.  So I said, \"Is there anything I can do to help?\" \n   \"Would you, Dad?\" he sniffed    \"What was our agreement?\"    \"You said you'd help me if you had time.\"    \"I have time.\"    So he ran into the house and came back with tw o sacks.  He handed me one.  \"Will you pick that \nstuff up?\"  He pointed to the garbage from Satu rday night's barbecue.  \"It makes me sick!\" \n   So I did.  I did exactly what he asked me to do.  And that was when he  signed the agreement in \nhis heart.  It became his yard, his stewardship.    He only asked for help two or three more times th at entire summer.  He took  care of that yard.  He \nkept it greener and cleaner than it had ever been under my steward ship.  He even reprimanded his \nbrothers and sisters if they left so  much as a gum wrapper on the lawn. \n   Trust is the highest form of human motivation.  It  brings out the very best in people.  But it takes \ntime and patience, and it doesn't preclude the ne cessity to train and develop people so that their \ncompetency can rise to the level of that trust.    I am convinced that if stewardship delegation  is done correctly, both parties will benefit and \nultimately much more work will ge t done in much less time.  I believe that a family that is well \norganized, whose time has been spent effectively de legating on a one-to-one basis, can organize the \nwork so that everyone can do everything in about an hour a day.  But that takes the internal capacity \nto want to manage, not just produce.  The focus is on effectiveness, not efficiency. \n   Certainly you can pick up that room better than  a child, but the key is that you want to empower the \nchild to do it.  It takes time.  You have to get invo lved in the training and development.  It",

You haven't done a single thing!  But I knew what was \nhard -- self management, self-supervision.  So I said, \"Is there anything I can do to help?\" \n   \"Would you, Dad?\" he sniffed    \"What was our agreement?\"    \"You said you'd help me if you had time.\"    \"I have time.\"    So he ran into the house and came back with tw o sacks.  He handed me one.  \"Will you pick that \nstuff up?\"  He pointed to the garbage from Satu rday night's barbecue.  \"It makes me sick!\" \n   So I did.  I did exactly what he asked me to do.  And that was when he  signed the agreement in \nhis heart.  It became his yard, his stewardship.    He only asked for help two or three more times th at entire summer.  He took  care of that yard.  He \nkept it greener and cleaner",

He \nkept it greener and cleaner than it had ever been under my steward ship.  He even reprimanded his \nbrothers and sisters if they left so  much as a gum wrapper on the lawn. \n   Trust is the highest form of human motivation.  It  brings out the very best in people.  But it takes \ntime and patience, and it doesn't preclude the ne cessity to train and develop people so that their \ncompetency can rise to the level of that trust.    I am convinced that if stewardship delegation  is done correctly, both parties will benefit and \nultimately much more work will ge t done in much less time.  I believe that a family that is well \norganized, whose time has been spent effectively de legating on a one-to-one basis, can organize the \nwork so that everyone can do everything in about an hour a day.  But that takes the internal capacity \nto want to manage, not just produce.  The focus is on effectiveness, not efficiency. \n  ",

You have to get invo lved in the training and development.  It takes time, \nbut how valuable that time is downstream!  It saves you so much in the long run. \n   This approach involves an entirely new paradigm of delegation.  In effect, it changes the nature of \nthe relationship:  The steward  becomes his own bo ss, governed by a conscience that contains the \ncommitment to agreed upon desired results.  But it also releases his creative energies toward doing \nwhatever is necessary in harmony with correct principles to achieve those desired results. \n   The  principles involved in stewardship delegati on are correct and applicable  to any kind of person \nor situation.  With immature people, you specify fewer desired results and more guidelines, identify \nmore resources, conduct more frequent accoun tability interviews, and apply more immediate \nconsequences.  With more mature people, you have more challenging desired results, fewer guidelines, \nless frequent accountability, and less meas urable but more discernible criteria. \n   Effective delegation is perhaps the best indicato r of effective management simply because it is so \nbasic to both personal and organizational growth.

I have included in the Appendix an exercise  called \"A Quadrant II Day at the Office\" which will \nenable you to see in a business se tting how powerfully this paradigm can impact your effectiveness. \n   As you work to develop a Quadrant II paradigm,  you will increase your ability to organize and \nexecute every week of your life around your deepest priorities, to walk your talk.  You will not be \ndependent on any other person or thing fo r the effective management of your life. \n",

You have to get invo lved in the training and development.  It takes time, \nbut how valuable that time is downstream!  It saves you so much in the long run. \n   This approach involves an entirely new paradigm of delegation.  In effect, it changes the nature of \nthe relationship:  The steward  becomes his own bo ss, governed by a conscience that contains the \ncommitment to agreed upon desired results.  But it also releases his creative energies toward doing \nwhatever is necessary in harmony with correct principles to achieve those desired results. \n   The  principles involved in stewardship delegati on are correct and applicable  to any kind of person \nor situation.  With immature people, you specify fewer desired results and more guidelines, identify \nmore resources, conduct more frequent accoun tability interviews, and apply more immediate \nconsequences.  With more mature people, you have more challenging desired results, fewer guidelines, \nless frequent accountability, and less meas urable but more discernible criteria. \n   Effective delegation is perhaps the best indicato r of effective",

    "text": "   Interestingly, every one of the Seven Habits is  in Quadrant II.  Every one deals with fundamentally \nimportant things that, if done on a regular basis, would make a tremendous positive difference in our \nlives.  Application Suggestions:     1.  Identify a Quadrant II activity you know has been  neglected in your life -- one that, if done well, \nwould have a significant impact in your life, either  personally or professionally.  Write it down and \ncommit to implement it.    2.  Draw a Time Management Matrix and try to estimate what percentage of your time you spend \nin each quadrant.  Then log your time for three da ys in 15-minute intervals.  How accurate was your \nestimate?  Are you satisfied with the way you sp end your time?  What do you need to change. \n   3.  Make a list of responsibilities you could dele gate and the people you could delegate to or train \nto be responsible in these areas.  Determine what is needed to start the process of delegation or \ntraining.    4.  Organize your next week.  Start by wr iting down your roles and goals for the week, then \ntransfer the goals to a specific action plan.  At  the end of the week, evaluate how well your plan \ntranslated your deep values and purposes into your  daily life and the degree of integrity you were able \nto maintain to those values and purposes.    5.  Commit yourself to start organizing on a weekly basis and set up a regular time to do it. \n   6.  Either convert your current planning tool in to a fourth generation tool or secure such a tool. \n   7.  Go through \"A Quadrant II Day at the Office \" (Appendix B) for a more in-depth understanding \nof the impact of a Quadrant II paradigm.",

    "text": "   Interestingly, every one of the Seven Habits is  in Quadrant II.  Every one deals with fundamentally \nimportant things that, if done on a regular basis, would make a tremendous positive difference in our \nlives.  Application Suggestions:     1.  Identify a Quadrant II activity you know has been  neglected in your life -- one that, if done well, \nwould have a significant impact in your life, either  personally or professionally.  Write it down and \ncommit to implement it.    2.  Draw a Time Management Matrix and try to estimate what percentage of your time you spend \nin each quadrant.  Then log your time for three da ys in 15-minute intervals.  How accurate was your \nestimate?  Are you satisfied with the way you sp end your time?  What do you need to change. \n   3.  Make a list of responsibilities you could dele gate and the people you could delegate to or train \nto be responsible in these areas.  Determine what is needed to start the process of delegation or \ntraining.    4.  Organize your next week.  Start by wr iting down your roles and goals for the week, then \ntransfer the goals to a specific action plan.  At  the end of the week, evaluate how well your plan \ntranslated your deep values and purposes into your  daily life and the degree of integrity you were able \nto maintain to those values and purposes.    5.  Commit yourself to start organizing on a weekly basis and set up a regular time to do it. \n   6.  Either convert your current planning tool in to a fourth generation tool or secure such a tool. \n   7.  Go through \"A Quadrant II Day at the Office \" (Appendix B) for a more in-depth understanding \nof the impact of a Quadrant II paradigm.",
