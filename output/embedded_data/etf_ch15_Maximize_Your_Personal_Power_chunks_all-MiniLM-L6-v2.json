For this reason, working long hours into the night,\nalthough it is sometimes necessary, means that you are usually\nproducing less and less in more and more time.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 88The more tired you become, the worse will be the quality of your\nwork and the more mistakes you will make. At a certain point, like a\nbattery that is run down, you can reach “the wall” and simply be\nunable to continue.\nWork at Your Own Pace\nThere are specific times during the day when you are at your best.\nYou need to identify these times and discipline yourself to use themon your most important and challenging tasks.\nMost people are at their best in the mornings, after a good night's\nsleep. Some people are better in the afternoons. A few people are\nmost creative and productive in the evenings or late at night.\nA major reason for procrastination is fatigue, or attempting to start on\na task when you are tired out. You have no energy or enthusiasm. Like\na cold engine in the morning, you can't seem to get yourself started.\nWhenever you feel overtired and overwhelmed with too much to do\nand too little time, stop yourself and just say, \"All I can do is all I can\ndo.\"\nSometimes the very best use of your time is to go home early and go\nto bed and sleep for ten hours straight. This can completely recharge\nyou and enable you to get two or three times as much done the\nfollowing day, and of a far higher quality, than if you had continued\nworking long into the night.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 89Get Enough Sleep\nAccording to many researchers, the average American is not getting\nenough sleep relative to the amount of work he or she is doing.Millions of Americans are working in a state of mental fog  as the result\nof working too much and sleeping too little.\n One of the smartest things you can do is to turn off the television and\nget to bed by ten o'clock each night during the week. Sometimes, oneextra hour of sleep per night can change your entire life.\nHere is a rule for you. Take at least one full day off every week.\nDuring this day, either Saturday or Sunday, you must absolutely\nrefuse to read, clear correspondence, catch up on things from the\noffice or do anything else that taxes your brain. Instead, you go to a\nmovie, exercise, spend time with your family, go for a walk or anyactivity that allows your brain to completely recharge itself. It is true\nthat “a change is as good as a rest.”\nTake regular vacations each year, both long weekends and one and\ntwo-week breaks to rest and rejuvenate. You are always the most\nproductive after a restful weekend or a vacation.\nGoing to bed early five nights a week, sleeping in on the weekends\nand taking one full day off each week will ensure that you have far\nmore energy. This added energy will enable you to overcome\nprocrastination and get started on your major tasks faster and with\ngreater resolve than you ever could if you were tired out.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 90Guard Your Physical Health\nIn addition to lots of rest, and to keep your energy levels at their\nhighest, be careful about what you eat. Start the day with a highprotein, low fat and low carbohydrate breakfast. Eat salads with fishor chicken at lunch. Avoid sugar, salt, white flour products or\ndeserts. Avoid soft drinks and candy bars or pastries. Feed yourself\nas you would feed a world class athlete before a competition, becausein many respects, that’s what you are before starting work each day.\nAim to exercise about 200 minutes each week, the agreed-upon\nstandard for excellent levels of fitness. This is equal to 30 minutes perday, and can be achieved by going for a walk before or after work, or\nwalking short stretches during the day. You can swim, use exercise",

For this reason, working long hours into the night,\nalthough it is sometimes necessary, means that you are usually\nproducing less and less in more and more time.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 88The more tired you become, the worse will be the quality of your\nwork and the more mistakes you will make. At a certain point, like a\nbattery that is run down, you can reach “the wall” and simply be\nunable to continue.\nWork at Your Own Pace\nThere are specific times during the day when you are at your best.\nYou need to identify these times and discipline yourself to use themon your most important and challenging tasks.\nMost people are at their best in the mornings, after a good night's\nsleep. Some people are better in the afternoons. A few people are\nmost creative and productive in the evenings or late at night.\nA major reason for procrastination is fatigue, or attempting to start on\na task when you are tired out. You have no energy or enthusiasm. Like\na cold engine in the morning, you can't seem to get yourself started.\nWhenever you feel overtired and overwhelmed with too much to do\nand too little time, stop yourself and just say, \"All I can do is all I can\ndo.\"\nSometimes the very best use of your time is to go home early and go\nto bed and sleep for ten hours straight. This can completely recharge\nyou and enable you to get two or three times as much done the\nfollowing day, and of a far higher quality,",

At a certain point, like a\nbattery that is run down, you can reach “the wall” and simply be\nunable to continue.\nWork at Your Own Pace\nThere are specific times during the day when you are at your best.\nYou need to identify these times and discipline yourself to use themon your most important and challenging tasks.\nMost people are at their best in the mornings, after a good night's\nsleep. Some people are better in the afternoons. A few people are\nmost creative and productive in the evenings or late at night.\nA major reason for procrastination is fatigue, or attempting to start on\na task when you are tired out. You have no energy or enthusiasm. Like\na cold engine in the morning, you can't seem to get yourself started.\nWhenever you feel overtired and overwhelmed with too much to do\nand too little time, stop yourself and just say, \"All I can do is all I can\ndo.\"\nSometimes the very best use",

This can completely recharge\nyou and enable you to get two or three times as much done the\nfollowing day, and of a far higher quality, than if you had continued\nworking long into the night.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 89Get Enough Sleep\nAccording to many researchers, the average American is not getting\nenough sleep relative to the amount of work he or she is doing.Millions of Americans are working in a state of mental fog  as the result\nof working too much and sleeping too little.\n One of the smartest things you can do is to turn off the television and\nget to bed by ten o'clock each night during the week. Sometimes, oneextra hour of sleep per night can change your entire life.\nHere is a rule for you. Take at least one full day off every week.\nDuring this day, either Saturday or Sunday, you must absolutely\nrefuse to read, clear correspondence, catch up on things from the\noffice or do anything else that taxes your brain. Instead, you go to a\nmovie, exercise, spend time with your family, go for a walk or anyactivity that allows your brain to completely recharge itself. It is true\nthat “a change is as good as a rest.”\nTake regular vacations each year, both long weekends and one and\ntwo-week breaks to rest and rejuvenate. You are always the most\nproductive after a restful weekend or a vacation.\nGoing to bed early five nights a week, sleeping in on the weekends\nand taking one full day off each week will ensure that you have far\nmore energy. This added energy will enable you to overcome\nprocrastination and get started on your major tasks faster and with\ngreater resolve than you ever could if you were tired out.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 90Guard Your Physical Health\nIn addition to lots of rest, and to keep your energy levels at their\nhighest, be careful about what you eat. Start the day with a highprotein, low fat and low carbohydrate breakfast. Eat salads with fishor chicken at lunch. Avoid sugar, salt, white flour products or\ndeserts. Avoid soft drinks and candy bars or pastries. Feed yourself\nas you would feed a world class athlete before a competition, becausein many respects, that’s what you are before starting work each day.\nAim to exercise about 200 minutes each week, the",

This can completely recharge\nyou and enable you to get two or three times as much done the\nfollowing day, and of a far higher quality, than if you had continued\nworking long into the night.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 89Get Enough Sleep\nAccording to many researchers, the average American is not getting\nenough sleep relative to the amount of work he or she is doing.Millions of Americans are working in a state of mental fog  as the result\nof working too much and sleeping too little.\n One of the smartest things you can do is to turn off the television and\nget to bed by ten o'clock each night during the week. Sometimes, oneextra hour of sleep per night can change your entire life.\nHere is a rule for you. Take at least one full day off every week.\nDuring this day, either Saturday or Sunday, you must absolutely\nrefuse to read, clear correspondence, catch up on things from the\noffice or do anything else that taxes your brain. Instead, you go to a\nmovie, exercise, spend time with your family, go for a walk or anyactivity that allows your brain",

Instead, you go to a\nmovie, exercise, spend time with your family, go for a walk or anyactivity that allows your brain to completely recharge itself. It is true\nthat “a change is as good as a rest.”\nTake regular vacations each year, both long weekends and one and\ntwo-week breaks to rest and rejuvenate. You are always the most\nproductive after a restful weekend or a vacation.\nGoing to bed early five nights a week, sleeping in on the weekends\nand taking one full day off each week will ensure that you have far\nmore energy. This added energy will enable you to overcome\nprocrastination and get started on your major tasks faster and with\ngreater resolve than you ever could if you were tired out.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 90Guard Your Physical Health\nIn addition to lots of rest, and to keep your energy levels at their\nhighest, be careful about what you eat. Start the day with a highprotein, low fat and low carbohydrate breakfast. Eat salads with fishor chicken at lunch. Avoid sugar, salt, white flour products or\ndeserts. Avoid soft drinks",
