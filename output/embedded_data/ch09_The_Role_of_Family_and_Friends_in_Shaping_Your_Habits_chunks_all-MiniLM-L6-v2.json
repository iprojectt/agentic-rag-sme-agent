In fact, it was all\nhe believed in: he completely rejected the idea of innate\ntalent. He claimed that with deliberate practice and the\ndevelopment of good habits, a child could become a genius\nin any ﬁeld. His mantra was “ A genius is not born, but is\neducated and trained.”\nLaszlo believed in this idea so strongly that he wanted to\ntest it with his own children—and he was writing to Klara\nbecause he “needed a wife willing to jump on board.” Klara\nwas a teacher and, although she may not have been as\nadamant as Laszlo, she also believed that with proper\ninstruction, anyone could advance their skills.\nLaszlo decided chess would be a suitable ﬁeld for the\nexperiment, and he laid out a plan to raise his children to\nbecome chess prodigies. The kids would be home-schooled,\na rarity in Hungary at the time. The house would be ﬁlled\nwith chess books and pictures of famous chess players. The\nchildren would play against each other constantly and\ncompete in the best tournaments they could ﬁnd. The\nfamily would keep a meticulous ﬁle system of the\ntournament history of every competitor the children faced.\nTheir lives would be dedicated to chess.\nLaszlo successfully courted Klara, and within a few\nyears, the P olgars were parents to three young girls:\nSusan, Soﬁa, and Judit.\nSusan, the oldest, began playing chess when she was\nfour years old. W ithin six months, she was defeating adults.\nSoﬁa, the middle child, did even better . By fourteen, she\nwas a world champion, and a few years later , she became a\ngrandmaster .\nJudit, the youngest, was the best of all. By age ﬁve, she\ncould beat her father . At twelve, she was the youngest\nplayer ever listed among the top one hundred chess players\nin the world. A t ﬁfteen years and four months old, she\nbecame the youngest grandmaster of all time—younger\nthan Bobby Fischer , the previous record holder . For twenty-\nseven years, she was the number-one-ranked female chess\nplayer in the world.\nThe childhood of the P olgar sisters was atypical, to say\nthe least. And yet, if you ask them about it, they claim their\nlifestyle was attractive, even enjoyable. In interviews, the\nsisters talk about their childhood as entertaining rather\nthan grueling. They loved playing chess. They couldn’t get\nenough of it. Once, Laszlo reportedly found Soﬁa playing\nchess in the bathroom in the middle of the night.\nEncouraging her to go back to sleep, he said, “Soﬁa, leave\nthe pieces alone!” T o which she replied, “Daddy , they won’t\nleave me alone!”\nThe P olgar sisters grew up in a culture that prioritized\nchess above all else—praised them for it, rewarded them\nfor it. In their world, an obsession with chess was normal.\nAnd as we are about to see, whatever habits are normal in\nyour culture are among the most attractive behaviors you’ll\nﬁnd.\nTHE SEDUCTIVE PULL OF SOCIAL NORMS\nHumans are herd animals. W e want to ﬁt in, to bond with\nothers, and to earn the respect and approval of our peers.\nSuch inclinations are essential to our survival. F or most of\nour evolutionary history , our ancestors lived in tribes.\nBecoming separated from the tribe—or worse, being cast\nout—was a death sentence. “The lone wolf dies, but the\npack survives.” *\nMeanwhile, those who collaborated and bonded with\nothers enjoyed increased safety , mating opportunities, and\naccess to resources. As Charles Darwin noted, “In the long\nhistory of humankind, those who learned to collaborate and\nimprovise most eﬀectively have prevailed.” As a result, one\nof the deepest human desires is to belong. And this ancient\npreference exerts a powerful inﬂuence on our modern\nbehavior .\nWe don’t choose our earliest habits, we imitate them. W e\nfollow the script handed down by our friends and family ,\nour church or school, our local community and society at\nlarge. Each of these cultures and groups comes with its\nown set of expectations and standards—when and whether\nto get married, how many children to have, which holidays",

    "text": "I\n9\nThe R ole of F amily and F riends in Shaping Y our Habits\nN 1965, a Hungarian man named Laszlo P olgar wrote a\nseries of strange letters to a woman named Klara.\nLaszlo was a ﬁrm believer in hard work. In fact, it was all\nhe believed in: he completely rejected the idea of innate\ntalent. He claimed that with deliberate practice and the\ndevelopment of good habits, a child could become a genius\nin any ﬁeld. His mantra was “ A genius is not born, but is\neducated and trained.”\nLaszlo believed in this idea so strongly that he wanted to\ntest it with his own children—and he was writing to Klara\nbecause he “needed a wife willing to jump on board.” Klara\nwas a teacher and, although she may not have been as\nadamant as Laszlo, she also believed that with proper\ninstruction, anyone could advance their skills.\nLaszlo decided chess would be a suitable ﬁeld for the\nexperiment, and he laid out a plan to raise his children to\nbecome chess prodigies. The kids would be home-schooled,\na rarity in Hungary at the time. The house would be ﬁlled\nwith chess books and pictures of famous chess players. The\nchildren would play against each other constantly and\ncompete in the best tournaments they could ﬁnd. The\nfamily would keep a meticulous ﬁle system of the\ntournament history of every competitor the children faced.\nTheir lives would be dedicated to chess.\nLaszlo successfully courted Klara, and within a few\nyears, the P olgars were parents to three young girls:\nSusan, Soﬁa, and Judit.\nSusan, the oldest, began playing chess when she was\nfour years old. W ithin six months, she was defeating adults.\nSoﬁa, the middle child, did even better . By fourteen, she\nwas a world champion, and a few years later , she became a\ngrandmaster .\nJudit, the youngest, was the best of all. By age ﬁve, she\ncould beat her father . At twelve, she was the youngest\nplayer ever listed among the top one hundred chess players\nin the world. A t ﬁfteen years and four months old, she\nbecame the youngest grandmaster of all time—younger\nthan Bobby",

In fact, it was all\nhe believed in: he completely rejected the idea of innate\ntalent. He claimed that with deliberate practice and the\ndevelopment of good habits, a child could become a genius\nin any ﬁeld. His mantra was “ A genius is not born, but is\neducated and trained.”\nLaszlo believed in this idea so strongly that he wanted to\ntest it with his own children—and he was writing to Klara\nbecause he “needed a wife willing to jump on board.” Klara\nwas a teacher and, although she may not have been as\nadamant as Laszlo, she also believed that with proper\ninstruction, anyone could advance their skills.\nLaszlo decided chess would be a suitable ﬁeld for the\nexperiment, and he laid out a plan to raise his children to\nbecome chess prodigies. The kids would be home-schooled,\na rarity",

    "text": " twelve, she was the youngest\nplayer ever listed among the top one hundred chess players\nin the world. A t ﬁfteen years and four months old, she\nbecame the youngest grandmaster of all time—younger\nthan Bobby Fischer , the previous record holder . For twenty-\nseven years, she was the number-one-ranked female chess\nplayer in the world.\nThe childhood of the P olgar sisters was atypical, to say\nthe least. And yet, if you ask them about it, they claim their\nlifestyle was attractive, even enjoyable. In interviews, the\nsisters talk about their childhood as entertaining rather\nthan grueling. They loved playing chess. They couldn’t get\nenough of it. Once, Laszlo reportedly found Soﬁa playing\nchess in the bathroom in the middle of the night.\nEncouraging her to go back to sleep, he said, “Soﬁa, leave\nthe pieces alone!” T o which she replied, “Daddy , they won’t\nleave me alone!”\nThe P olgar sisters grew up in a culture that prioritized\nchess above all else—praised them for it, rewarded them\nfor it. In their world, an obsession with chess was normal.\nAnd as we are about to see, whatever habits are normal in\nyour culture are among the most attractive behaviors you’ll\nﬁnd.\nTHE SEDUCTIVE PULL OF SOCIAL NORMS\nHumans are herd animals. W e want to ﬁt in, to bond with\nothers, and to earn the respect and approval of our peers.\nSuch inclinations are essential to our survival. F or most of\nour evolutionary history , our ancestors lived in tribes.\nBecoming separated from the tribe—or worse, being cast\nout—was a death sentence. “The lone wolf dies, but the\npack survives.” *\nMeanwhile, those who collaborated and bonded with\nothers enjoyed increased safety , mating opportunities, and\naccess to resources. As Charles Darwin noted, “In the long\nhistory of humankind, those who learned to collaborate and\nimprovise most eﬀectively have prevailed.” As a result, one\nof the deepest human desires is to belong. And this ancient\npreference exerts a powerful inﬂuence on our modern\nbehavior .\nWe don’t choose our earliest habits, we imitate them. W e\nfollow the script handed down by our friends",

And yet, if you ask them about it, they claim their\nlifestyle was attractive, even enjoyable. In interviews, the\nsisters talk about their childhood as entertaining rather\nthan grueling.

    "text": " and family ,\nour church or school, our local community and society at\nlarge. Each of these cultures and groups comes with its\nown set of expectations and standards—when and whether\nto get married, how many children to have, which holidays\nto celebrate, how much money to spend on your child’s\nbirthday party . In many ways, these social norms are the\ninvisible rules that guide your behavior each day . You’re\nalways keeping them in mind, even if they are at the not\ntop of your mind. Often, you follow the habits of your\nculture without thinking, without questioning, and\nsometimes without remembering. As the French\nphilosopher Michel de Montaigne wrote, “The customs and\npractices of life in society sweep us along.”\nMost of the time, going along with the group does not\nfeel like a burden. Everyone wants to belong. If you grow\nup in a family that rewards you for your chess skills,\nplaying chess will seem like a very attractive thing to do . If\nyou work in a job where everyone wears expensive suits,\nthen you’ll be inclined to splurge on one as well. If all of\nyour friends are sharing an inside joke or using a new\nphrase, you’ll want to do it, too, so they know that you “get\nit.” Behaviors are attractive when they help us ﬁt in.\nWe imitate the habits of three groups in particular:\n1. The close.\n2. The many .\n3. The powerful.\nEach group oﬀers an opportunity to leverage the 2nd\nLaw of Behavior Change and make our habits more\nattractive.\n1. Imitating the Close\nProximity has a powerful eﬀect on our behavior . This is true\nof the physical environment, as we discussed in Chapter 6,\nbut it is also true of the social environment.\nWe pick up habits from the people around us. W e copy\nthe way our parents handle arguments, the way our peers\nﬂirt with one another , the way our coworkers get results.\nWhen your friends smoke pot, you give it a try , too. When\nyour wife has a habit of double-checking that the door is\nlocked before going to bed, you pick it up as well.\nI ﬁnd that I often imitate the behavior of those around\nme without realizing it. In conversation, I’ll automatically\nassume the body posture of the other person. In college, I\nbegan to talk like my roommates. When traveling to other\ncountries, I unconsciously imitate the local accent despite\nreminding myself to stop.\nAs a general rule, the closer we are to someone, the\nmore likely we are to imitate some of their habits. One\ngroundbreaking study tracked twelve thousand people for\nthirty-two years and found that “ a person’s chances of\nbecoming obese increased by 57 percent if he or she had a\nfriend who became obese.” It works the other way , too.\nAnother study found that if one person in a relationship lost\nweight, the other partner would also slim down about one\nthird of the time. Our friends and family provide a sort of\ninvisible peer pressure that pulls us in their direction.\nOf course, peer pressure is bad only if you’re surrounded\nby bad inﬂuences. When astronaut Mike Massimino was a\ngraduate student at MIT , he took a small robotics class. Of\nthe ten people in the class, four became astronauts. If your\ngoal was to make it into space, then that room was about\nthe best culture you could ask for . Similarly , one study\nfound that the higher your best friend’s IQ at age eleven or\ntwelve, the higher your IQ would be at age ﬁfteen, even\nafter controlling for natural levels of intelligence. W e soak\nup the qualities and practices of those around us.\nOne of the most eﬀective things you can do to build\nbetter habits is to join a culture where your desired\nbehavior is the normal behavior . New habits seem\nachievable when you see others doing them every day . If\nyou are surrounded by ﬁt people, you’re more likely to\nconsider working out to be a common habit. If you’re\nsurrounded by jazz lovers, you’re more likely to believe it’s\nreasonable to play jazz every day . Your culture sets your\nexpectation for what is “normal.” Surround yourself with\npeople who have the habits you want to have yourself .\nYou’ll rise together .\nTo make your habits even more attractive, you can take\nthis strategy one step further .\nJoin a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the\nnormal behavior and (2) you already have something in\ncommon with the group.

Each of these cultures and groups comes with its\nown set of expectations and standards—when and whether\nto get married, how many children to have, which holidays\nto celebrate, how much money to spend on your child’s\nbirthday party . In many ways, these social norms are the\ninvisible rules that guide your behavior each day . You’re\nalways keeping them in mind, even if they are at the not\ntop of your mind. Often, you follow the habits of your\nculture without thinking, without questioning, and\nsometimes without remembering. As the French\nphilosopher Michel de Montaigne wrote, “The customs and\npractices of life in society sweep us along.”\nMost of the time, going along with the group does not\nfeel like a burden. Everyone wants to belong. If you grow\nup in a family that rewards you for your chess skills,\nplaying chess will seem like a very attractive thing to do . If\nyou work in a job where everyone wears expensive suits,\nthen you’ll be inclined to splurge on one as well. If all of\nyour friends are sharing an inside joke or using a new\nphrase, you’ll want to do it, too, so they know that you “get\nit.” Behaviors are attractive when they help us ﬁt in.\nWe imitate the habits of three groups in particular:\n1. The close.\n2. The many .\n3. The powerful.\nEach group oﬀers an opportunity to leverage the 2nd\nLaw of Behavior Change and make our habits more\nattractive.\n1. Imitating the Close\nProximity has a powerful eﬀect on our behavior . This is true\nof the physical environment, as we discussed in Chapter 6,\nbut it is also true of the social environment.\nWe pick up habits from the people around us. W e copy\nthe way our parents handle arguments, the way our peers\nﬂirt with one another , the way our coworkers get results.\nWhen your friends smoke pot, you give it a try , too. When\nyour wife has a habit of double-checking that the door is\nlocked before going to bed, you pick it up as well.\nI ﬁnd that I often imitate the behavior of those around\nme without realizing it. In conversation, I’ll automatically\nassume the body posture of the other person. In college,",

    "text": " going to bed, you pick it up as well.\nI ﬁnd that I often imitate the behavior of those around\nme without realizing it. In conversation, I’ll automatically\nassume the body posture of the other person. In college, I\nbegan to talk like my roommates. When traveling to other\ncountries, I unconsciously imitate the local accent despite\nreminding myself to stop.\nAs a general rule, the closer we are to someone, the\nmore likely we are to imitate some of their habits. One\ngroundbreaking study tracked twelve thousand people for\nthirty-two years and found that “ a person’s chances of\nbecoming obese increased by 57 percent if he or she had a\nfriend who became obese.” It works the other way , too.\nAnother study found that if one person in a relationship lost\nweight, the other partner would also slim down about one\nthird of the time. Our friends and family provide a sort of\ninvisible peer pressure that pulls us in their direction.\nOf course, peer pressure is bad only if you’re surrounded\nby bad inﬂuences. When astronaut Mike Massimino was a\ngraduate student at MIT , he took a small robotics class. Of\nthe ten people in the class, four became astronauts. If your\ngoal was to make it into space, then that room was about\nthe best culture you could ask for . Similarly , one study\nfound that the higher your best friend’s IQ at age eleven or\ntwelve, the higher your IQ would be at age ﬁfteen, even\nafter controlling for natural levels of intelligence. W e soak\nup the qualities and practices of those around us.\nOne of the most eﬀective things you can do to build\nbetter habits is to join a culture where your desired\nbehavior is the normal behavior . New habits seem\nachievable when you see others doing them every day . If\nyou are surrounded by ﬁt people, you’re more likely to\nconsider working out to be a common habit. If you’re\nsurrounded by jazz lovers, you’re more likely to believe it’s\nreasonable to play jazz every day . Your culture sets your\nexpectation for what is “normal.” Surround yourself with\npeople who have the habits you want to have yourself .\nYou’ll rise together .\nTo make your habits even more attractive, you can take\nthis strategy one step further .\nJoin a culture where (1) your desired behavior",

Steve Kamb, an entrepreneur in\nNew Y ork City , runs a company called Nerd Fitness, which\n“helps nerds, misﬁts, and mutants lose weight, get strong,\nand get healthy .” His clients include video game lovers,\nmovie fanatics, and average Joes who want to get in shape.\nMany people feel out of place the ﬁrst time they go to the\ngym or try to change their diet, but if you are already\nsimilar to the other members of the group in some way—\nsay, your mutual love of Star W ars—change becomes more\nappealing because it feels like something people like you\nalready do .\nNothing sustains motivation better than belonging to the\ntribe. It transforms a personal quest into a shared one.\nPreviously , you were on your own. Y our identity was\nsingular . You are a reader . You are a musician. Y ou are an\nathlete. When you join a book club or a band or a cycling\ngroup, your identity becomes linked to those around you.\nGrowth and change is no longer an individual pursuit. We\nare readers. W e are musicians. W e are cyclists.  The shared\nidentity begins to reinforce your personal identity . This is\nwhy remaining part of a group after achieving a goal is\ncrucial to maintaining your habits. It’s friendship and\ncommunity that embed a new identity and help behaviors\nlast over the long run.\n2. Imitating the Many\nIn the 1950s, psychologist Solomon Asch conducted a\nseries of experiments that are now taught to legions of\nundergrads each year . To begin each experiment, the\nsubject entered the room with a group of strangers.\nUnbeknownst to them, the other participants were actors\nplanted by the researcher and instructed to deliver scripted\nanswers to certain questions.\nThe group would be shown one card with a line on it and\nthen a second card with a series of lines. Each person was\nasked to select the line on the second card that was similar\nin length to the line on the ﬁrst card. It was a very simple\ntask. Here is an example of two cards used in the\nexperiment:\nCONFORMING TO SOCIAL NORMS\nFIGURE 10: This is a r epresentation of two car ds used by\nSolomon Asch in his famous social confor mity e xperiments. The\nlength of the line on the ﬁrst car d (lef t) is obviously the same as\nline C, but when a gr oup of actors claimed it was a diﬀer ent\nlength the r esear ch subjects would of ten change their minds and\ngo with the cr owd rather than believe their own eyes.\nThe experiment always began the same. First, there\nwould be some easy trials where everyone agreed on the\ncorrect line. A fter a few rounds, the participants were\nshown a test that was just as obvious as the previous ones,\nexcept the actors in the room would select an intentionally\nincorrect  answer . For example, they would respond “ A” to\nthe comparison shown in Figure 10. Everyone would agree\nthat the lines were the same even though they were clearly\ndiﬀerent.\nThe subject, who was unaware of the ruse, would\nimmediately become bewildered. Their eyes would open\nwide. They would laugh nervously to themselves. They\nwould double-check the reactions of other participants.\nTheir agitation would grow as one person after another\ndelivered the same incorrect response. Soon, the subject\nbegan to doubt their own eyes. Eventually , they delivered\nthe answer they knew in their heart to be incorrect.\nAsch ran this experiment many times and in many\ndiﬀerent ways. What he discovered was that as the number\nof actors increased, so did the conformity of the subject. If\nit was just the subject and one actor , then there was no\neﬀect on the person’s choice. They just assumed they were\nin the room with a dummy . When two actors were in the\nroom with the subject, there was still little impact. But as\nthe number of people increased to three actors and four\nand all the way to eight, the subject became more likely to\nsecond-guess themselves. By the end of the experiment,\nnearly 75 percent of the subjects had agreed with the\ngroup answer even though it was obviously incorrect.\nWhenever we are unsure how to act, we look to the\ngroup to guide our behavior . We are constantly scanning\nour environment and wondering, “ What is everyone else\ndoing?” W e check reviews on Amazon or Y elp or\nTripAdvisor because we want to imitate the “best” buying,\neating, and",

Here is an example of two cards used in the\nexperiment:\nCONFORMING TO SOCIAL NORMS\nFIGURE 10: This is a r epresentation of two car ds used by\nSolomon Asch in his famous social confor mity e xperiments. The\nlength of the line on the ﬁrst car d (lef t) is obviously the same as\nline C, but when a gr oup of actors claimed it was a diﬀer ent\nlength the r esear ch subjects would of ten change their minds and\ngo with the cr owd rather than believe their own eyes.\nThe experiment always began the same. First, there\nwould be some easy trials where everyone agreed on the\ncorrect line. A fter a few rounds, the participants were\nshown a test that was just as obvious as the previous ones,\nexcept the actors in the room would select an intentionally\nincorrect  answer . For example, they would respond “ A” to\nthe comparison shown in Figure 10. Everyone would agree\nthat the lines were the same even though they were clearly\ndiﬀerent.\nThe subject, who was unaware of the ruse, would\nimmediately become bewildered. Their eyes would open\nwide. They would laugh nervously to themselves. They\nwould double-check the reactions of other participants.\nTheir agitation would grow as one person after another\ndelivered the same incorrect response. Soon, the subject\nbegan to doubt their own eyes. Eventually , they delivered\nthe answer they knew in their heart to be incorrect.\nAsch ran this experiment many times and in many\ndiﬀerent ways. What he discovered was that as the number\nof actors increased, so did the conformity of the subject. If\nit was just the subject and one actor , then there was no\neﬀect on the person’s choice. They just assumed they were\nin the room with a dummy . When two actors were in the\nroom with the subject, there was still little impact. But as\nthe number of people increased to three actors and four\nand all the way to eight, the subject became more likely to\nsecond-guess themselves. By the end of the experiment,\nnearly 75 percent of the subjects had agreed with the\ngroup answer even though it was obviously incorrect.\nWhenever we are unsure how to act, we look to the\ngroup to guide",

    "text": " our behavior . We are constantly scanning\nour environment and wondering, “ What is everyone else\ndoing?” W e check reviews on Amazon or Y elp or\nTripAdvisor because we want to imitate the “best” buying,\neating, and travel habits. It’s usually a smart strategy .\nThere is evidence in numbers.\nBut there can be a downside.\nThe normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the\ndesired behavior of the individual. F or example, one study\nfound that when a chimpanzee learns an eﬀective way to\ncrack nuts open as a member of one group and then\nswitches to a new group that uses a less eﬀective strategy ,\nit will avoid using the superior nut cracking method just to\nblend in with the rest of the chimps.\nHumans are similar . There is tremendous internal\npressure to comply with the norms of the group. The\nreward of being accepted is often greater than the reward\nof winning an argument, looking smart, or ﬁnding truth.\nMost days, we’d rather be wrong with the crowd than be\nright by ourselves.\nThe human mind knows how to get along with others. It\nwants  to get along with others. This is our natural mode.\nYou can override it—you can choose to ignore the group or\nto stop caring what other people think—but it takes work.\nRunning against the grain of your culture requires extra\neﬀort.\nWhen changing your habits means challenging the tribe,\nchange is unattractive. When changing your habits means\nﬁtting in with the tribe, change is very attractive.\n3. Imitating the P owerful\nHumans everywhere pursue power , prestige, and status.\nWe want pins and medallions on our jackets. W e want\nPresident or P artner in our titles. W e want to be\nacknowledged, recognized, and praised. This tendency can\nseem vain, but overall, it’s a smart move. Historically , a\nperson with greater power and status has access to more\nresources, worries less about survival, and proves to be a\nmore attractive mate.\nWe are drawn to behaviors that earn us respect,\napproval, admiration, and status. W e want to be the one in\nthe gym who can do muscle-ups or the musician who can\nplay the hardest chord progressions or the parent with the\nmost accomplished children because these things separate\nus from the crowd. Once we ﬁt in, we start looking for ways\nto stand out.\nThis is one reason we care so much about the habits of\nhighly eﬀective people. W e try to copy the behavior of\nsuccessful people because we desire success ourselves.\nMany of our daily habits are imitations of people we\nadmire. Y ou replicate the marketing strategies of the most\nsuccessful ﬁrms in your industry . You make a recipe from\nyour favorite baker . You borrow the storytelling strategies\nof your favorite writer . You mimic the communication style\nof your boss. W e imitate people we envy .\nHigh-status people enjoy the approval, respect, and\npraise of others. And that means if a behavior can get us\napproval, respect, and praise, we ﬁnd it attractive.\nWe are also motivated to avoid behaviors that would\nlower our status. W e trim our hedges and mow our lawn\nbecause we don’t want to be the slob of the neighborhood.\nWhen our mother comes to visit, we clean up the house\nbecause we don’t want to be judged. W e are continually\nwondering “ What will others think of me?” and altering our\nbehavior based on the answer .\nThe P olgar sisters—the chess prodigies mentioned at the\nbeginning of this chapter—are evidence of the powerful\nand lasting impact social inﬂuences can have on our\nbehavior . The sisters practiced chess for many hours each\nday and continued this remarkable eﬀort for decades. But\nthese habits and behaviors maintained their attractiveness,\nin part, because they were valued by their culture. From\nthe praise of their parents to the achievement of diﬀerent\nstatus markers like becoming a grandmaster , they had\nmany reasons to continue their eﬀort.\nChapter Summary\nThe culture we live in determines which behaviors are\nattractive to us.\nWe tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved\nof by our culture because we have a strong desire to ﬁt\nin and belong to the tribe.\nWe tend to imitate the habits of three social groups:\nthe close (family and friends), the many (the tribe), and\nthe powerful (those with status and prestige).\nOne of the most eﬀective things you can do to build\nbetter habits is to join a culture where (1) your desired\nbehavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already\nhave something in common with the",

    "text": " our behavior . We are constantly scanning\nour environment and wondering, “ What is everyone else\ndoing?” W e check reviews on Amazon or Y elp or\nTripAdvisor because we want to imitate the “best” buying,\neating, and travel habits. It’s usually a smart strategy .\nThere is evidence in numbers.\nBut there can be a downside.\nThe normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the\ndesired behavior of the individual. F or example, one study\nfound that when a chimpanzee learns an eﬀective way to\ncrack nuts open as a member of one group and then\nswitches to a new group that uses a less eﬀective strategy ,\nit will avoid using the superior nut cracking method just to\nblend in with the rest of the chimps.\nHumans are similar . There is tremendous internal\npressure to comply with the norms of the group. The\nreward of being accepted is often greater than the reward\nof winning an argument, looking smart, or ﬁnding truth.\nMost days, we’d rather be wrong with the crowd than be\nright by ourselves.\nThe human mind knows how to get along with others. It\nwants  to get along with others. This is our natural mode.\nYou can override it—you can choose to ignore the group or\nto stop caring what other people think—but it takes work.\nRunning against the grain of your culture requires extra\neﬀort.\nWhen changing your habits means challenging the tribe,\nchange is unattractive. When changing your habits means\nﬁtting in with the tribe, change is very attractive.\n3. Imitating the P owerful\nHumans everywhere pursue power , prestige, and status.\nWe want pins and medallions on our jackets. W e want\nPresident or P artner in our titles. W e want to be\nacknowledged, recognized, and praised. This tendency can\nseem vain, but overall, it’s a smart move.
