It is also called the Pareto Principle after itsfounder, the Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, who first wrote aboutit in 1895. Pareto noticed that people in his society seemed to divide\nnaturally into what he called the \"vital few,” the top 20% in terms of\nmoney and influence, and the “trivial many,” the bottom 80%.\nHe later discovered that virtually all economic activity was subject to\nthis Pareto Principle as well.\nFor example, this rule says that 20% of your activities will account for\n80% of your results. 20% of your customers will account for 80% of\nyour sales. 20% of your products or services will account for 80% of\nyour profits. 20% of your tasks will account for 80% of the value of\nwhat you do, and so on.\nThis means that if you have a list of ten items to do, two of those\nitems will turn out to be worth as much or more than the other eight\nitems put together.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 29Number of Tasks versus Importance of Tasks\nHere is an interesting discovery. Each of these tasks may take the\nsame amount of time to accomplish. But one or two of those taskswill contribute five or ten times the value as any of the others.\nOften, one item on a list of ten things that you have to do can be\nworth more than all the other nine items put together. This task isinvariably the frog that you should eat first.\nCan you guess on which items the average person is most likely to\nprocrastinate? The sad fact is that most people procrastinate on thetop ten or twenty percent of items that are the most valuable and\nimportant, the “vital few.” They busy themselves instead with the\nleast important 80%, the \"trivial many\" that contribute very little to\nresults.\nFocus on Activities versus Accomplishments\nYou often see people who appear to be busy all day long but they\nseem to accomplish very little. This is almost always because they are\nbusy doing things that are of low value while they procrastinate on the\none or two activities that, if they completed them quickly and well,could make a real difference to their companies and to their careers.\nThe most valuable tasks you can do each day are often the hardest\nand most complex. But the payoff and rewards for completing these\ntasks efficiently can be tremendous. For this reason, you must\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 30adamantly refuse to work on tasks in the bottom 80% while you still\nhave tasks in the top 20% left to be done.\nBefore you begin work, always ask yourself, “Is this task in the top\n20% of my activities or in the bottom 80%?”\nRule: “Resist the temptation to clear up small things first.”\nRemember, whatever you choose to do, over and over, eventually\nbecomes a habit that is hard to break. If you choose to start your day\non low value tasks, you soon develop the habit of always starting and\nworking on low value tasks. This is not the kind of habit you want todevelop, or keep.\nThe hardest part of any important task is getting started on it in the\nfirst place. Once you actually begin work on a valuable task, you seemto be naturally motivated to continue. There is a part of your mind\nthat loves to be busy working on significant tasks that can really make\na difference. Your job is to feed this part of your mind continually.\nMotivate Yourself\nJust thinking about starting and finishing an important task motivates\nyou and helps you to overcome procrastination. The fact is that theamount of time required to complete an important job is often the\nsame as the time required to do an unimportant job. The difference is\nthat you get a tremendous feeling of pride and satisfaction from the\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 31completion of something valuable and significant. However, when\nyou complete a low value task, using the same amount of time and\nenergy, you get little or no satisfaction at all.\nTime management is really life management, personal management.\nIt is really taking control over the sequence of events . Time\nmanagement is control over what you do next. And you are always\nfree to choose the task that you will do next. Your ability to choose\nbetween the important and the unimportant is the key determinant of\nyour success in life and work.\n Effective, productive people discipline themselves to start on the\nmost important task",

    "text": "EAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 28CHAPTER 3\nApply the 80/20 Rule to Everything\n“We always have time enough, if we will but use it aright.”\nWolfgang Von Goethe\nThe 80/20 Rule is one of the most helpful of all concepts of time and\nlife management. It is also called the Pareto Principle after itsfounder, the Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, who first wrote aboutit in 1895. Pareto noticed that people in his society seemed to divide\nnaturally into what he called the \"vital few,” the top 20% in terms of\nmoney and influence, and the “trivial many,” the bottom 80%.\nHe later discovered that virtually all economic activity was subject to\nthis Pareto Principle as well.\nFor example, this rule says that 20% of your activities will account for\n80% of your results. 20% of your customers will account for 80% of\nyour sales. 20% of your products or services will account for 80% of\nyour profits. 20% of your tasks will account for 80% of the value of\nwhat you do, and so on.\nThis means that if you have a list of ten items to do, two of those\nitems will turn out to be worth as much or more than the other eight\nitems put together.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 29Number of Tasks versus Importance of Tasks\nHere is an interesting discovery. Each of these tasks may take the\nsame amount of time to accomplish. But one or two of those taskswill contribute five or ten times the value as any of the others.\nOften, one item on a list of ten things that you have to do can be\nworth more than all the other nine items put together. This task isinvariably the frog that you should eat first.\nCan you guess on which items the average person is most likely to\nprocrastinate? The sad fact is that most people procrastinate on thetop ten or twenty percent of items that are the most valuable and\nimportant, the “vital few.” They busy themselves instead with the\nleast important 80%, the \"trivial many\" that contribute very little to\nresults.\nFocus on Activities versus Accomplishments\nYou often see people who appear to be busy all day long but they\nseem to accomplish very little. This is almost always because they are\nbusy doing things",

Pareto noticed that people in his society seemed to divide\nnaturally into what he called the \"vital few,” the top 20% in terms of\nmoney and influence, and the “trivial many,” the bottom 80%.\nHe later discovered that virtually all economic activity was subject to\nthis Pareto Principle as well.\nFor example, this rule says that 20% of your activities will account for\n80% of your results. 20% of your customers will account for 80% of\nyour sales. 20% of your products or services will account for 80% of\nyour profits. 20% of your tasks will account for 80% of the value of\nwhat you do, and so on.\nThis means that",

Each of these tasks may take the\nsame amount of time to accomplish. But one or two of those taskswill contribute five or ten times the value as any of the others.\nOften, one item on a list of ten things that you have to do can be\nworth more than all the other nine items put together. This task isinvariably the frog that you should eat first.\nCan you guess on which items the average person is most likely to\nprocrastinate? The sad fact is that most people procrastinate on thetop ten or twenty percent of items that are the most valuable and\nimportant, the “vital few.” They busy themselves instead with the\nleast important 80%, the \"trivial many",

This is almost always because they are\nbusy doing things that are of low value while they procrastinate on the\none or two activities that, if they completed them quickly and well,could make a real difference to their companies and to their careers.\nThe most valuable tasks you can do each day are often the hardest\nand most complex. But the payoff and rewards for completing these\ntasks efficiently can be tremendous. For this reason, you must\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 30adamantly refuse to work on tasks in the bottom 80% while you still\nhave tasks in the top 20% left to be done.\nBefore you begin work, always ask yourself, “Is this task in the top\n20% of my activities or in the bottom 80%?”\nRule: “Resist the temptation to clear up small things first.”\nRemember, whatever you choose to do, over and over, eventually\nbecomes a habit that is hard to break. If you choose to start your day\non low value tasks, you soon develop the habit of always starting and\nworking on low value tasks. This is not the kind of habit you want todevelop, or keep.\nThe hardest part of any important task is getting started on it in the\nfirst place. Once you actually begin work on a valuable task, you seemto be naturally motivated to continue. There is a part of your mind\nthat loves to be busy working on significant tasks that can really make\na difference. Your job is to feed this part of your mind continually.\nMotivate Yourself\nJust thinking about starting and finishing an important task motivates\nyou and helps you to overcome procrastination. The fact is that theamount of time required to complete an important job is often the\nsame as the time required to do an unimportant job. The difference is\nthat you get a tremendous feeling of pride and satisfaction from the\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 31completion of something valuable and significant. However, when\nyou complete a low value task, using the same amount of time and\nenergy, you get little or no satisfaction at all.\nTime management is really life management, personal management.\nIt is really taking control over the sequence of events . Time\nmanagement is control over what you do next. And you are always\n",

Your ability to choose\nbetween the important and the unimportant is the key determinant of\nyour success in life and work.\n Effective, productive people discipline themselves to start on the\nmost important task that is before them. They force themselves to eat\nthat frog, whatever it is. As a result, they accomplish vastly more than\nthe average person and are much happier as a result. This should be\nyour way of working as well.\nEat That Frog!\n1.  Make a list of all the key goals, activities, projects and\nresponsibilities in your life today. Which of them are, or could be, in\nthe top 10% or 20% of tasks that represent, or could represent, 80% or\n90% of your results?\n2.  Resolve today that you are going to spend more and more of your\ntime working in those few areas that can really make a difference in\nyou life and career, and less and less time on lower value activities.",

Your ability to choose\nbetween the important and the unimportant is the key determinant of\nyour success in life and work.\n Effective, productive people discipline themselves to start on the\nmost important task that is before them.

This should be\nyour way of working as well.\nEat That Frog!\n1.  Make a list of all the key goals, activities, projects and\nresponsibilities in your life today. Which of them are, or could be, in\nthe top 10% or 20% of tasks that represent, or could represent, 80% or\n90% of your results?\n2.
