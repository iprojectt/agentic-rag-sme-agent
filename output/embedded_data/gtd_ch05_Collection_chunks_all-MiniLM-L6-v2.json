Bu t if you can hang in \nthere and really do the whole collection process, 1 00 percent, it will \nchange your experience dramatically and give you an  important \nnew reference point for being on top of your work. \nWhen I coach a client through this process, the col lection \nphase usually takes between one and six hours, thou gh it did take \nall of twenty hours with one person (finally I told  him, \"You get \nthe idea\"). It can take longer than you think if yo u are committed \nto a full-blown capture that will include everythin g at work and \neverywhere else. That means going through every sto rage area \nand every nook and cranny in every location, includ ing cars, \nboats, and other homes, if you have them. \nBe assured that if you give yourself at least a cou ple of hours \nto tackle this part, you can grab the major portion  of things out- \nstanding. And you can even capture the rest by crea ting relevant \nplaceholding notes—for example, \"Purge and process boat stor- \nage shed\" and \"Deal with hall closet.\" \nIn the real world, you probably won't be able to ke ep your \nstuff 100 percent collected all of the time. If you 're like most peo- \nple, you'll move too fast and be engaged in too man y things dur- \nCHAPTER 5  I  COLLECTION: CORRALLING YOUR \"STUFF\" \ning the course of a week to get all your ideas and commitments \ncaptured outside your head. But it should become an  ideal stan- \ndard that keeps you motivated to consistently \"clea n house\" of all \nthe things about your work and life that have your attention. \nReady, Set. . . \nThere are very practical reasons to gather everythi ng before you \nstart processing it: \n1 |   it's helpful to have a sense of the volume of stuff you have to \ndeal with; \n2 |   it lets you know where the \"end of the tunnel\" is; and \n3 |   when you're processing and organizing, you don't want to be \ndistracted psychologically by an amorphous mass of stuff \nthat might still be \"somewhere.\" Once you have all the things \nthat require your attention gathered in one place, you'll auto- \nmatically be operating from a state of enhanced foc us and \ncontrol. \nIt can be daunting to capture into one location, at  one time, \nall the things that don't belong where they are. It  may even seem a \nlittle counterintuitive, because for the most part,  most of that stuff \nwas not, and is not, \"that important\"; that's why i t's still lying \naround. It wasn't an urgent thing when it first sho wed up, and \nprobably nothing's blown up yet because it hasn't b een dealt with. \nIt's the business card you put in your wallet of so mebody you \nthought you might want to contact sometime. It's th e little piece \nof techno-gear in the bottom desk drawer that you'r e missing a \npart for. It's the printer that you keep telling yo urself you're going \nto move to a better location in your office. These are the kinds of \nthings that nag at you but that you haven't decided  either to deal \nwith or to drop entirely from your list of open loo ps. But because \nyou think there still could be something important in there, that \n105 \nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  I  PART TWO \n\"stuff\" is controlling you and taking up more psychic energy than it \ndeserves. Keep in mind, you can feel good about wha t you're not \ndoing, only when you know what you're not doing. \nSo it's time to begin. Grab your in-basket and a ha lf-inch \nstack of plain paper for your notes, and let's . . . \n... Go! \nPhysical Gathering \nThe first activity is to search your physical envir on- \nment for anything that doesn't belong where it is, the \nway it is, permanently, and put it into your in-bas ket. \nYou'll be gathering things that are incomplete, thi ngs \nthat have some decision about potential action tied\nto them. They all go",

They all go into \"in,\" so they'll be avail able \nfor later processing. \n106 What Stays Where It Is \nThe best way to create a clean decision about wheth er something \nshould go into the in-basket is to understand clear ly what shouldn't \ngo in. Here are the four categories of things that can remain \nwhere they are, the way they are, with no action ti ed to them: \n• Supplies \n• Reference material \n• Decoration \n• Equipment \nSupplies . . . include anything you need to keep because you use \nit regularly. Stationery, business cards, stamps, s taples, Post-it \npads, legal pads, paper clips, ballpoint refills, b atteries, forms you \nneed to fill out from time to time, rubber bands—al l of these \nqualify. Many people also have a \"personal supplies \" drawer at \nwork containing dental floss, Kleenex, breath mints , and so on. Train yourself to \nnotice and collect \nanything that \ndoesn't belong \nwhere it is forever. \nCHAPTER 5  I  COLLECTION: CORRALLING YOUR \"STUFF\" \nReference Material ... is anything you simply keep for informa- \ntion as needed, such as manuals for your software, the local take- \nout deli menu, or your kid's soccer schedule. This category \nincludes your telephone and address information, an y material \nrelevant to projects, themes, and topics, and sourc es such as dic- \ntionaries, encyclopedias, and almanacs. \nDecoration . . . means pictures of family, artwork, and fun and \ninspiring things pinned to your bulletin board. You  also might \nhave plaques, mementos, and/or plants. \nEquipment ... is obviously the telephone, computer, fax, prin ter, \nwastebasket, furniture, and/or VCR. \nYou no doubt have a lot of things that fall into th ese four catego- \nries—basically all your tools and your gear, which have no \nactions \ntied to them. Everything else goes into \"in.\" But m any of the \nthings you might initially interpret as supplies, r eference, decora- \ntion, or equipment could also have action associate d with them \nbecause they still aren't exactly the way they need  to be. \nFor instance, most people have, in their desk drawe rs and on \ntheir credenzas and bulletin boards, a lot of refer ence materials \nthat either are out of date or need to be organized  somewhere \nelse. Those should go into \"in.\" Likewise, if your supplies drawer \nis out of control, full of lots of dead or unorgani zed stuff, that's an \nincomplete that needs to be captured. Are the photo s of your kids \ncurrent ones? Is the artwork what you want on the wall? Are the \nmementos really something you still want to keep? I s the furni- \nture precisely the way it should be? Is the compute r set up the way \nyou want it? Are the plants in your office alive? I n other words, \nsupplies, reference materials, decoration, and equi pment may \nneed to be tossed into the in-basket if they're not  just where they \nshould be, the way they should be. \n107 \n108 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  I  PART TWO \nIssues About Collecting \nAs you engage in the collecting phase, you may run into one or \nmore of the following: \n• you've got a lot more than will fit into one in-bas ket; \n• you're likely to get derailed into purging and orga nizing; \n• you may have some form of stuff already collected a nd \norganized; and/or \n• you're likely to run across some critical things th at you want to \nkeep in front of you. \nWhat If an Item Is Too Big to Go in the In-Basket? If you can't \nphysically put something in the in-basket, then wri te a note on a \npiece of letter-size plain paper to represent it. F or instance, if you \nhave a poster or other piece of artwork behind the door to your \noffice, just write \"Artwork behind door\" on a lette r-size piece of \npaper and put the paper in the in-basket. \nBe sure to date it, too. This has a couple of benef its. If your \norganization system winds up containing some of the se pieces of \npaper representing something else, it'll be useful to know when the",

Here are the four categories of things that can remain \nwhere they are, the way they are, with no action ti ed to them: \n• Supplies \n• Reference material \n• Decoration \n• Equipment \nSupplies . . . include anything you need to keep because you use \nit regularly.

Many people also have a \"personal supplies \" drawer at \nwork containing dental floss, Kleenex, breath mints , and so on.

This category \nincludes your telephone and address information, an y material \nrelevant to projects, themes, and topics, and sourc es such as dic- \ntionaries, encyclopedias, and almanacs. \nDecoration . . . means pictures of family, artwork, and fun and \ninspiring things pinned to your bulletin board. You  also might \nhave plaques, mementos, and/or plants. \nEquipment ... is obviously the telephone, computer, fax, prin ter, \nwastebasket, furniture, and/or VCR. \nYou no doubt have a lot of things that fall into th ese four catego- \nries—basically all your tools and your gear, which have no \nactions \ntied to them.

Everything else goes into \"in.\" But m any of the \nthings you might initially interpret as supplies, r eference, decora- \ntion, or equipment could also have action associate d with them \nbecause they still aren't exactly the way they need  to be. \nFor instance, most people have, in their desk drawe rs and on \ntheir credenzas and bulletin boards, a lot of refer ence materials \nthat either are out of date or need to be organized  somewhere \nelse. Those should go into \"in.\" Likewise, if your supplies drawer \nis out of control, full of lots of dead or unorgani zed stuff, that's an \nincomplete that needs to be captured. Are the photo s of your kids \ncurrent ones? Is the artwork what you want on the wall? Are the \nmementos really something you still want to keep? I s the furni- \nture precisely the way it should be? Is the compute r set up the way \nyou want it? Are the plants in your office alive? I n other words, \nsupplies, reference materials, decoration, and equi pment may \nneed to be tossed into the in-basket if they're not  just where they \nshould be, the way they should be. \n107 \n108 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  I  PART TWO \nIssues About Collecting \nAs you engage in the collecting phase, you may run into one or \nmore of the following: \n• you've got a lot more than will fit into one in-bas ket; \n• you're likely to get derailed into purging and orga nizing; \n• you may have some form of stuff already collected a nd \norganized; and/or \n• you're likely to run across some critical things th at you want to \nkeep in front of you. \nWhat If an Item Is Too Big to Go in the In-Basket? If you can't \nphysically put something in the in-basket, then wri te a note on a \npiece of letter-size plain paper to represent it. F or instance, if you \nhave a poster or other piece of artwork behind the door to your \noffice, just write \"Artwork behind door\" on a lette r-size piece of \npaper and put the paper",

If your \norganization system winds up containing some of the se pieces of \npaper representing something else, it'll be useful to know when the \nnote was created. It's also just a great habit to d ate everything you \nhand-write, from Post-it notes to your assistant, t o voice-mails you \ndownload onto a pad, to notes you take on a phone c all with a \nclient. The 3 percent of the time that this little piece of informa- \ntion will be extremely useful makes it worth develo ping the habit. \nWhat If the Pile Is Too Big to Fit into the In-Bask et? If you're like \n98 percent of my clients, your initial gathering ac tivity will collect \nmuch more than can be comfortably stacked in an in- basket. If \nthat's the case, just create stacks around the in-b asket, and maybe \neven on the floor underneath it. Ultimately you'll be emptying the \nin-stacks, as you process and organize everything. In the mean- \ntime, though, make sure that there's some obvious v isual distinc- \ntion between the stacks that are \"in\" and everythin g else. \nCHAPTER 5  |  COLLECTION: CORRALLING YOUR \"STUFF\" \nInstant Dumping If it's immediately evident that something is \ntrash, go ahead and toss it when you see it. For so me of my clients, \nthis marks the first time they have ever cleaned th eir center desk \ndrawer! \nIf you're not sure what something is or whether it' s worth \nkeeping, go ahead and put it into \"in.\" You'll be a ble to decide \nabout it later, when you process the in-basket. Wha t you don't \nwant to do is to let yourself get wrapped up in thi ngs piece by \npiece, trying to decide this or that. You'll do that later anyway  if \nit's in \"in,\" and it's easier to make those kinds o f choices when \nyou're in processing mode. The objective for the co llection process \nis to get everything into \"in\" as quickly as possible so you've appro- \npriately retrenched and \"drawn the battle lines.\" \nBe Careful of the Purge-and-Organize Bug! Many people get hit \nwith the purge-and-organize virus as they're going through vari- \nous areas of their office (and their home). If that  happens to you, \nit's OK, so long as you have a major open window of  time to get \nthrough the whole process (like at least a whole we ek ahead of \nyou). Otherwise you'll need to break it up into chu nks and cap- \nture them as little projects or actions to do, with  reminders in your \nsystem, like \"Purge four-drawer cabinet\" or \"Clean office closet.\" \nWhat you don't want to do is let yourself get caught running \ndown a rabbit trail cleaning up some piece of your work and then \nnot be able to get through the whole action-managem ent imple- \nmentation process. It may take longer than you thin k, and you \nwant to go for the gold and finish processing all y our stuff and set- \nting up your system as soon as possible. \nWhat About Things That Are Already on Lists and in Organizers'? \nYou may already have some lists and some sort of or ganization \nsystem in place. But unless you're thoroughly famil iar with this \nworkflow-processing model and have implemented it p reviously, \nI recommend that you treat those lists as items sti ll to be pro- \ncessed, like everything else in \"in.\" You'll want y our system to be \n109 \n110 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  |  PART TWO \nconsistent, and it'll be necessary to evaluate ever ything from the \nsame viewpoint to get it that way. \n\"But I Can't Lose That Thing . . . !\" Often in the collection \nprocess someone will run across a piece of paper or  a document \nthat causes her to say, \"Oh, my God! I forgot about  that! I've got to \ndeal with that!\" It could be a phone slip with a re turn call she was \nsupposed to handle two days before, or some meeting  notes that \nremind her of an action she was supposed to take we eks ago. She \ndoesn't want to put whatever it is into the huge st ack of other stuff \nin her in-basket because she's afraid she might los e track of it \nagain. \nIf that happens to you, first ask yourself if it's something that \nreally has to be handled before you get though this initial im ple- \nmentation time. If so, best deal",

If your \norganization system winds up containing some of the se pieces of \npaper representing something else, it'll be useful to know when the \nnote was created. It's also just a great habit to d ate everything you \nhand-write, from Post-it notes to your assistant, t o voice-mails you \ndownload onto a pad, to notes you take on a phone c all with a \nclient. The 3 percent of the time that this little piece of informa- \ntion will be extremely useful makes it worth develo ping the habit. \nWhat If the Pile Is Too Big to Fit into the In-Bask et? If you're like \n98 percent of my clients, your initial gathering ac tivity will collect \nmuch more than can be comfortably stacked in an in- basket. If \nthat's the case, just create stacks around the in-b asket, and maybe \neven on the floor underneath it. Ultimately you'll be emptying the \nin-stacks, as you process and organize everything. In the mean- \ntime, though, make sure that there's some obvious v isual distinc- \ntion between the stacks that are \"in\" and everythin g else. \nCHAPTER 5  |  COLLECTION: CORRALLING YOUR \"STUFF\" \nInstant Dumping If it's immediately evident that something is \ntrash, go ahead and toss it when you see it. For so me of my clients, \nthis marks the first time they have ever cleaned th eir center desk \ndrawer! \nIf you're not sure what something is or whether it' s worth \nkeeping, go ahead and put it into \"in.\" You'll be a ble to decide \nabout it later, when you process the in-basket. Wha t you don't \nwant to do is to let yourself get wrapped up in thi ngs piece by \npiece, trying to decide this or that. You'll do that later anyway  if \nit's in \"in,\" and it's easier to make those kinds o f choices when \nyou're in processing mode. The objective for the co llection process \nis to get everything into \"in\" as quickly as possible so you've appro- \npriately retrenched and \"drawn the battle lines.\" \nBe Careful of the Purge-and-Organize Bug!

If that  happens to you, \nit's OK, so long as you have a major open window of  time to get \nthrough the whole process (like at least a whole we ek ahead of \nyou). Otherwise you'll need to break it up into chu nks and cap- \nture them as little projects or actions to do, with  reminders in your \nsystem, like \"Purge four-drawer cabinet\" or \"Clean office closet.\" \nWhat you don't want to do is let yourself get caught running \ndown a rabbit trail cleaning up some piece of your work and then \nnot be able to get through the whole action-managem ent imple- \nmentation process.

But unless you're thoroughly famil iar with this \nworkflow-processing model and have implemented it p reviously, \nI recommend that you treat those lists as items sti ll to be pro- \ncessed, like everything else in \"in.\" You'll want y our system to be \n109 \n110 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  |  PART TWO \nconsistent, and it'll be necessary to evaluate ever ything from the \nsame viewpoint to get it that way. \n\"But I Can't Lose That Thing . . . !\" Often in the collection \nprocess someone will run across a piece of paper or  a document \nthat causes her to say, \"Oh, my God! I forgot about  that! I've got to \ndeal with that!\" It could be a phone slip with a re turn call she was \nsupposed to handle two days before, or some meeting  notes that \nremind her of an action she was supposed to take we eks ago.

If that  happens to you, \nit's OK, so long as you have a major open window of  time to get \nthrough the whole process (like at least a whole we ek ahead of \nyou). Otherwise you'll need to break it up into chu nks and cap- \nture them as little projects or actions to do, with  reminders in your \nsystem, like \"Purge four-drawer cabinet\" or \"Clean office closet.\" \nWhat you don't want to do is let yourself get caught running \ndown a rabbit trail cleaning up some piece of your work and then \nnot be able to get through the whole action-managem ent imple- \nmentation process.

If so, best deal with it immediatel y so you get it \noff your mind. If not, go ahead and put it into \"in .\" You're going to \nget all that processed and emptied soon anyway, so it won't be \nlost. \nIf you can't deal with the action in the moment, an d you still \njust have to have the reminder right in front of you, go ahea d and \ncreate an \"emergency\" stack somewhere close at hand . It's not an \nideal solution, but it'll do. Keep in mind that som e potential anx- \niousness is going to surface as you make your stuff  more conscious \nto you than it's been. Create whatever supports you  need. \nStart with Your Desktop \nReady now? OK. Start piling those things on your de sk into \"in.\" \nOften there'll be numerous things right at hand tha t need to go \nin \nthere. Many people use their whole desktop as \"in\";  if you're one \nof them, you'll have several stacks around you to b egin your \"in\" \ncollection with. Start at one end of your work spac e and move \naround, dealing with everything on every cubic inch . Typical \nitems will be: \n• Stacks of mail and memos \n• Phone slips \nCHAPTER 5  |  COLLECTION: CORRALLING YOUR \"STUFF\" \n• Collected business cards \n• Notes from meetings \nResist the urge to say, as almost everyone does ini tially, \"Well, I \nknow what's in that stack, and that's where I want to leave it.\" \nThat's exactly what hasn't worked before, and it all needs to go \ninto the in-basket. \nAs you go around your desktop, ask yourself if you have any \nintention of changing any of the tools or equipment  there. Is your \nphone OK? Your computer? The desk itself? If anythi ng needs \nchanging, write a note about it and toss it into \"i n.\" \nDesk Drawers \nNext tackle the desk drawers, if you have them, one  at a time. Any \nattention on anything in there? Any actionable item s? Is there \nanything that doesn't belong there? If the answer t o any of these \nquestions is yes, put the actionable item into \"in\"  or write a note \nabout it. Again, whether you use this opportunity t o clean and \norganize the drawers or simply make a note to do it  later will \ndepend on how much time you have and how much stuff  is in \nthere. \nCountertops \nContinue working your way around your office, colle cting every- \nthing sitting on the tops of credenzas or counters or cabinets that \ndoesn't belong there permanently. Often there will be stacks of \nreading material, mail, and miscellaneous folders a nd support \nmaterial for actions and projects. Collect it all. \nMaybe there is reference material that you've alrea dy used \nand just left out. If that's so, and if you can ret urn it to the file \ncabinet or the bookshelf in just a second, go ahead  and do that. Be \ncareful to check with yourself, though, about wheth er there is \nsome potential action tied to the material before y ou put it away. \nIf there is, put it into \"in\" so you can deal with it later in the \nprocess. \n111 \nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  I  PART TWO \nInside the Cabinets \nNow look inside the cabinets. What's in there? Thes e are perfect \nareas for stashing large supplies and reference mat erials, and \nequally seductive for holding deeper levels of stuf f. \nAny broken or out-of-date things in there? Often I' ll \nfind collectibles and nostalgia that aren't meaning ful \nto my clients any longer. One general manager of an\ninsurance office, for example, wound up tossing out\nat least a small Dumpster's worth of \"recognition\" \nawards he had accumulated over the years. \nAgain, if some of these areas are out of control an d need \npurging and organizing, write that on a note and to ss it into \"in.\" \nFloors, Walls, and Shelves \nAnything on bulletin boards that needs action? Anyt hing tacked \nonto the walls that doesn't belong there? Any atten tion on your \npictures, artwork, plaques, or decorations? How abo ut the open \nshelves? Any books that need to be read or donated?  Any cata- \nlogs, manuals, or three",

Is your \nphone OK? Your computer? The desk itself? If anythi ng needs \nchanging, write a note about it and toss it into \"i n.\" \nDesk Drawers \nNext tackle the desk drawers, if you have them, one  at a time. Any \nattention on anything in there?

Is there \nanything that doesn't belong there? If the answer t o any of these \nquestions is yes, put the actionable item into \"in\"  or write a note \nabout it. Again, whether you use this opportunity t o clean and \norganize the drawers or simply make a note to do it  later will \ndepend on how much time you have and how much stuff  is in \nthere. \nCountertops \nContinue working your way around your office, colle cting every- \nthing sitting on the tops of credenzas or counters or cabinets that \ndoesn't belong there permanently. Often there will be stacks of \nreading material, mail, and miscellaneous folders a nd support \nmaterial for actions and projects. Collect it all. \nMaybe there is reference material that you've alrea dy used \nand just left out. If that's so, and if you can ret urn it to the file \ncabinet or the bookshelf in just a second, go ahead  and do that. Be \ncareful to check with yourself, though, about wheth er there is \nsome potential action tied to the material before y ou put it away. \nIf there is, put it into \"in\" so you can deal with it later in the \nprocess. \n111 \nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  I  PART TWO \nInside the Cabinets \nNow look inside the cabinets. What's in there? Thes e are perfect \nareas for stashing large supplies and reference mat erials, and \nequally seductive for holding deeper levels of stuf f. \nAny broken or out-of-date things in there? Often I' ll \nfind collectibles and nostalgia that aren't meaning ful \nto my clients any longer. One general manager of an\ninsurance office, for example, wound up tossing out\nat least a small Dumpster's worth of \"recognition\" \nawards he had accumulated over the years. \nAgain, if some of these areas are out of control an d need \npurging and organizing, write that on a note and to ss it into \"in.\" \nFloors, Walls, and Shelves \nAnything on bulletin boards that needs action?

Is there \nanything that doesn't belong there? If the answer t o any of these \nquestions is yes, put the actionable item into \"in\"  or write a note \nabout it. Again, whether you use this opportunity t o clean and \norganize the drawers or simply make a note to do it  later will \ndepend on how much time you have and how much stuff  is in \nthere. \nCountertops \nContinue working your way around your office, colle cting every- \nthing sitting on the tops of credenzas or counters or cabinets that \ndoesn't belong there permanently. Often there will be stacks of \nreading material, mail, and miscellaneous folders a nd support \nmaterial for actions and projects. Collect it all. \nMaybe there is reference material that you've alrea dy used \nand just left out. If that's so, and if you can ret urn it to the file \ncabinet or the bookshelf in just a second, go ahead  and do that. Be \ncareful",

Any cata- \nlogs, manuals, or three-ring binders that are out o f date or have \nsome potential action associated with them? Any pil es or stacks of \nthings on the floor? Just scoot them over next to y our in-basket to \nadd to the inventory. \nEquipment, Furniture, arid Fixtures \nIs there anything you want to do to or change about  any of your \noffice equipment or furniture or the physical space  itself? Does \neverything work? Do you have all the lighting you n eed? If there are \nactionable items, you know what to do: make a note and put it in \"in.\" \nOther Locations \nDepending on the scope of what you're addressing in  this process, \nyou may want to do some version of the same kind of  gathering \nanywhere else you keep stuff. If you're determined to get to a \nreally empty head, it's imperative that you do it everywhere. \n112 Consider whether \nyour collectible and \nnostalgia items are \nstill meaningful to \nyou. \nCHAPTER 5  I  COLLECTION: CORRALLING YOUR \"STUFF\" \nSome executives I work with find it immensely \nvaluable to take me home with them and have me \nwalk them through this process there as well. Often\nthey've allowed the \"not so important\" trap to ensn are \nthem in their home life, and it has gnawed away at \ntheir energy. Don't let the \"not\nso important\" trap \ngnaw away your \nenergy at home.\nMental Gathering: The Mind-Sweep \nOnce you feel you've collected all the physical thi ngs in your envi- \nronment that need processing, you'll want to collec t anything else \nthat may be residing in your psychic RAM. What has your atten- \ntion that isn't represented by something already in  your in-basket? \nThis is where the stack of plain paper really comes  into play. \nI recommend that you write out each thought, each i dea, each \nproject or thing that has your attention, on a separate sheet of paper. \nYou could make one long list on a pad, but given ho w you will \nlater be processing each item individually, it's ac tually more effec- \ntive to put everything on separate sheets. You will  likely not keep \nthese pieces of paper (unless you decide that low-t ech is your best \norganizing method), but it'll be handy to have them  as discrete \nitems to deal with as you're processing. \nIt will probably take you between twenty minutes an d an \nhour to clear your head onto separate notes, after you've gathered \neverything else. You'll find that things will tend to occur to you in \nsomewhat random fashion—little things, big things, personal \nthings, professional things, in no particular order . \nIn this instance, go for quantity. It's much better  to overdo \nthis process than to risk missing something. You ca n always toss \nthe junk later. Your first idea may be \"Save the oz one layer,\" and \nthen you'll think, \"I need cat food!\" Grab them all . Don't be sur- \nprised if you discover you've created quite a stack  of paper in \"in\" \nduring this procedure. \n113 \nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY I  PART TWO \n\"Trigger\" List \nTo assist in clearing your head, you may want to re view the \nfollowing \"Incompletion Triggers\" list, item by ite m, to see if \nyou've forgotten anything. Often you'll just need a  jog to unearth \nsomething lurking in a corner of your mind. Remembe r, when \nsomething occurs to you, write it on a piece of pap er and toss it \ninto \"in.\" \n\"Incompletion Triggers\" List \nProfessional \nProjects started, not completed \nProjects that need to be started \nCommitments/promises to others \nBoss/partners \nColleagues \nSubordinates \nOther people in organization \n\"Outside\" people \nCustomers \nOther organizations \nProfessionals \nCommunications to make/get     ,\nInternal/External\nInitiate or respond to:\nPhone calls \nVoice-mail\nE-mail\nPages \nFaxes \nLetters \nMemos \nOther writing to finish/submit\nReports Evaluations/reviews \nProposals \nArticles \nPromotional materials \nManuals/instructions \nRewrites and edits \nMeetings that need to be set/requested \nWho needs to know about what\ndecisions? \nSignificant read/review \nFinancial\nCash flow \nStatistics \nBudgets \nForecasts/projections \nP&Ls \nBalance sheet",

You'll find that things will tend to occur to you in \nsomewhat random fashion—little things, big things, personal \nthings, professional things, in no particular order . \nIn this instance, go for quantity. It's much better  to overdo \nthis process than to risk missing something. You ca n always toss \nthe junk later.

You \ndon't want to leave anything in \"in\" for an indefin ite period of \ntime, because then it would without fail creep back  into your psy- \nche again, since your mind would know you weren't d ealing with \nit. Of course, one of the main factors in people's resistance to col- \nlecting stuff into \"in\" is the lack of a good proce ssing and organiz- \ning methodology to handle it. \nThat brings us to the next chapter: \"Getting 'In' t o Empty.\" \n118 Connection is \ncompleted when \nyou can easily see \nthe edges to the \ninventory of \neverything that is \ncomplete.",

You \ndon't want to leave anything in \"in\" for an indefin ite period of \ntime, because then it would without fail creep back  into your psy- \nche again, since your mind would know you weren't d ealing with \nit. Of course, one of the main factors in people's resistance to col- \nlecting stuff into \"in\" is the lack of a good proce ssing and organiz- \ning methodology to handle it. \nThat brings us to the next chapter: \"Getting 'In' t o Empty.\" \n118 Connection is \ncompleted when \nyou can easily see \nthe edges to the \ninventory of \neverything that is \ncomplete.",

You \ndon't want to leave anything in \"in\" for an indefin ite period of \ntime, because then it would without fail creep back  into your psy- \nche again, since your mind would know you weren't d ealing with \nit. Of course, one of the main factors in people's resistance to col- \nlecting stuff into \"in\" is the lack of a good proce ssing and organiz- \ning methodology to handle it. \nThat brings us to the next chapter: \"Getting 'In' t o Empty.\" \n118 Connection is \ncompleted when \nyou can easily see \nthe edges to the \ninventory of \neverything that is \ncomplete.",
