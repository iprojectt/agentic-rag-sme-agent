It was the\neconomic center of P akistan and a transportation hub, with\nsome of the most active airports and seaports in the region.\nIn the commercial parts of town, you could ﬁnd all of the\nstandard urban amenities and bustling downtown streets.\nBut Karachi was also one of the least  livable cities in the\nworld.\nOver 60 percent of Karachi’s residents lived in squatter\nsettlements and slums. These densely packed\nneighborhoods were ﬁlled with makeshift houses cobbled\ntogether from old boards, cinder blocks, and other\ndiscarded materials. There was no waste removal system,\nno electricity grid, no clean water supply . When dry , the\nstreets were a combination of dust and trash. When wet,\nthey became a muddy pit of sewage. Mosquito colonies\nthrived in pools of stagnant water , and children played\namong the garbage.\nThe unsanitary conditions lead to widespread illness and\ndisease. Contaminated water sources caused epidemics of\ndiarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Nearly one third of\nthe children living there were malnourished. W ith so many\npeople crammed into such a small space, viruses and\nbacterial infections spread rapidly . It was this public health\ncrisis that had brought Stephen Luby to P akistan.\nLuby and his team realized that in an environment with\npoor sanitation, the simple habit of washing your hands\ncould make a real diﬀerence in the health of the residents.\nBut they soon discovered that many people were already\naware that handwashing was important.\nAnd yet, despite this knowledge, many residents were\nwashing their hands in a haphazard fashion. Some people\nwould just run their hands under the water quickly . Others\nwould only wash one hand. Many would simply forget to\nwash their hands before preparing food. Everyone said\nhandwashing was important, but few people made a habit\nout of it. The problem wasn’t knowledge. The problem was\nconsistency .\nThat was when Luby and his team partnered with\nProcter & Gamble to supply the neighborhood with\nSafeguard soap. Compared to your standard bar of soap,\nusing Safeguard was a more enjoyable experience.\n“In Pakistan, Safeguard was a premium soap,” Luby told\nme. “The study participants commonly mentioned how\nmuch they liked it.” The soap foamed easily , and people\nwere able to lather their hands with suds. It smelled great.\nInstantly , handwashing became slightly more pleasurable.\n“I see the goal of handwashing promotion not as\nbehavior change but as habit adoption,” Luby said. “It is a\nlot easier for people to adopt a product that provides a\nstrong positive sensory signal, for example the mint taste of\ntoothpaste, than it is to adopt a habit that does not provide\npleasurable sensory feedback, like ﬂossing one’s teeth. The\nmarketing team at Procter & Gamble talked about trying to\ncreate a positive handwashing experience.”\nWithin months, the researchers saw a rapid shift in the\nhealth of children in the neighborhood. The rate of diarrhea\nfell by 52 percent; pneumonia by 48 percent; and impetigo,\na bacterial skin infection, by 35 percent.\nThe long-term eﬀects were even better . “We went back\nto some of the households in Karachi six years after ,” Luby\ntold me. “ Over 95 percent of households who had been\ngiven the soap for free and encouraged to wash their hands\nhad a handwashing station with soap and water available\nwhen our study team visited. . . . W e had not given any soap\nto the intervention group for over ﬁve years, but during the\ntrial they had become so habituated to wash their hands,\nthat they had maintained the practice.” It was a powerful\nexample of the fourth and ﬁnal Law of Behavior Change:\nmake it satisfying.\nWe are more likely to repeat a behavior when the\nexperience is satisfying. This is entirely logical. F eelings of\npleasure—even minor ones like washing your hands with\nsoap that smells nice and lathers well—are signals that tell\nthe brain: “This feels good. Do this again, next time.”\nPleasure teaches your brain that a behavior is worth\nremembering and repeating.\nTake the story of chewing gum. Chewing gum had been\nsold commercially throughout the 1800s, but it wasn’t until\nW",

It was the\neconomic center of P akistan and a transportation hub, with\nsome of the most active airports and seaports in the region.\nIn the commercial parts of town, you could ﬁnd all of the\nstandard urban amenities and bustling downtown streets.\nBut Karachi was also one of the least  livable cities in the\nworld.\nOver 60 percent of Karachi’s residents lived in squatter\nsettlements and slums. These densely packed\nneighborhoods were ﬁlled with makeshift houses cobbled\ntogether from old boards, cinder blocks, and other\ndiscarded materials. There was no waste removal system,\nno electricity grid, no clean water supply . When dry , the\nstreets were a combination of dust and trash. When wet,\nthey became a muddy pit of sewage. Mosquito colonies\nthrived in pools of stagnant water , and children played\namong the garbage.\nThe unsanitary conditions lead to widespread illness and\ndisease. Contaminated water sources caused epidemics of\ndiarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Nearly one third of\nthe children living there were malnourished. W ith so many\npeople crammed into such a small space, viruses and\nbacterial infections spread rapidly . It was this public health\ncrisis that had brought Stephen Luby to P akistan.\nLuby and his team realized that in an environment with\npoor sanitation, the simple habit of washing your hands\ncould make a real diﬀerence in the health of the residents.\nBut they soon discovered that many people were already\naware that handwashing was important.\nAnd yet, despite this knowledge, many residents were\nwashing their hands in a haphazard fashion. Some people\nwould just run their hands under the water quickly . Others\nwould only wash one hand. Many would simply forget to\nwash their hands before preparing food. Everyone said\nhandwashing was important, but few people made a habit\nout of it. The problem wasn’t knowledge. The problem was\nconsistency .\nThat was when Luby and",

It was the\neconomic center of P akistan and a transportation hub, with\nsome of the most active airports and seaports in the region.\nIn the commercial parts of town, you could ﬁnd all of the\nstandard urban amenities and bustling downtown streets.\nBut Karachi was also one of the least  livable cities in the\nworld.\nOver 60 percent of Karachi’s residents lived in squatter\nsettlements and slums. These densely packed\nneighborhoods were ﬁlled with makeshift houses cobbled\ntogether from old boards, cinder blocks, and other\ndiscarded materials. There was no waste removal system,\nno electricity grid, no clean water supply . When dry , the\nstreets were a combination of dust and trash. When wet,\nthey became a muddy pit of sewage.

Contaminated water sources caused epidemics of\ndiarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Nearly one third of\nthe children living there were malnourished.

    "text": " would simply forget to\nwash their hands before preparing food. Everyone said\nhandwashing was important, but few people made a habit\nout of it. The problem wasn’t knowledge. The problem was\nconsistency .\nThat was when Luby and his team partnered with\nProcter & Gamble to supply the neighborhood with\nSafeguard soap. Compared to your standard bar of soap,\nusing Safeguard was a more enjoyable experience.\n“In Pakistan, Safeguard was a premium soap,” Luby told\nme. “The study participants commonly mentioned how\nmuch they liked it.” The soap foamed easily , and people\nwere able to lather their hands with suds. It smelled great.\nInstantly , handwashing became slightly more pleasurable.\n“I see the goal of handwashing promotion not as\nbehavior change but as habit adoption,” Luby said. “It is a\nlot easier for people to adopt a product that provides a\nstrong positive sensory signal, for example the mint taste of\ntoothpaste, than it is to adopt a habit that does not provide\npleasurable sensory feedback, like ﬂossing one’s teeth. The\nmarketing team at Procter & Gamble talked about trying to\ncreate a positive handwashing experience.”\nWithin months, the researchers saw a rapid shift in the\nhealth of children in the neighborhood. The rate of diarrhea\nfell by 52 percent; pneumonia by 48 percent; and impetigo,\na bacterial skin infection, by 35 percent.\nThe long-term eﬀects were even better . “We went back\nto some of the households in Karachi six years after ,” Luby\ntold me. “ Over 95 percent of households who had been\ngiven the soap for free and encouraged to wash their hands\nhad a handwashing station with soap and water available\nwhen our study team visited. . . . W e had not given any soap\nto the intervention group for over ﬁve years, but during the\ntrial they had become so habituated to wash their hands,\nthat they had maintained the practice.” It was a powerful\nexample of the fourth and ﬁnal Law of Behavior Change:\nmake it satisfying.\nWe are more likely to repeat a behavior when the\nexperience is satisfying. This is entirely logical. F eelings of\npleasure—even minor ones like washing your hands with\nsoap that smells nice and lathers well—are signals that tell\nthe brain: “This feels good. Do this again",

    "text": " would simply forget to\nwash their hands before preparing food. Everyone said\nhandwashing was important, but few people made a habit\nout of it. The problem wasn’t knowledge. The problem was\nconsistency .\nThat was when Luby and his team partnered with\nProcter & Gamble to supply the neighborhood with\nSafeguard soap. Compared to your standard bar of soap,\nusing Safeguard was a more enjoyable experience.\n“In Pakistan, Safeguard was a premium soap,” Luby told\nme. “The study participants commonly mentioned how\nmuch they liked it.” The soap foamed easily , and people\nwere able to lather their hands with suds. It smelled great.\nInstantly , handwashing became slightly more pleasurable.\n“I see the goal of handwashing promotion not as\nbehavior change but as habit adoption,” Luby said. “It is a\nlot easier for people to adopt a product that provides a\nstrong positive sensory signal, for example the mint taste of\ntoothpaste, than it is to adopt a habit that does not provide\npleasurable sensory feedback, like ﬂossing one’s teeth. The\nmarketing team at Procter & Gamble talked about trying to\ncreate a positive handwashing experience.”\n",

    "text": ", next time.”\nPleasure teaches your brain that a behavior is worth\nremembering and repeating.\nTake the story of chewing gum. Chewing gum had been\nsold commercially throughout the 1800s, but it wasn’t until\nWrigley launched in 1891 that it became a worldwide habit.\nEarly versions were made from relatively bland resins—\nchewy , but not tasty . Wrigley revolutionized the industry by\nadding ﬂavors like Spearmint and Juicy Fruit, which made\nthe product ﬂavorful and fun to use. Then they went a step\nfurther and began pushing chewing gum as a pathway to a\nclean mouth. Advertisements told readers to “Refresh Y our\nTaste.”\nTasty ﬂavors and the feeling of a fresh mouth provided\nlittle bits of immediate reinforcement and made the\nproduct satisfying to use. Consumption skyrocketed, and\nWrigley became the largest chewing gum company in the\nworld.\nToothpaste had a similar trajectory . Manufacturers\nenjoyed great success when they added ﬂavors like\nspearmint, peppermint, and cinnamon to their products.\nThese ﬂavors don’t improve the eﬀectiveness of toothpaste.\nThey simply create a “clean mouth” feel and make the\nexperience of brushing your teeth more pleasurable. My\nwife actually stopped using Sensodyne because she didn’t\nlike the aftertaste. She switched to a brand with a stronger\nmint ﬂavor , which proved to be more satisfying.\nConversely , if an experience is not satisfying, we have\nlittle reason to repeat it. In my research, I came across the\nstory of a woman who had a narcissistic relative who drove\nher nuts. In an attempt to spend less time with this\negomaniac, she acted as dull and as boring as possible\nwhenever he was around. W ithin a few encounters, he\nstarted avoiding her because he found her so uninteresting.\nStories like these are evidence of the Cardinal Rule of\nBehavior Change: What is rewarded is repeated. What is\npunished is avoided.  You learn what to do in the future\nbased on what you were rewarded for doing (or punished\nfor doing) in the past. P ositive emotions cultivate habits.\nNegative emotions destroy them.\nThe ﬁrst three laws of behavior change— make it obvious,\nmake it attractive, and make it easy —increase the odds\nthat a behavior will be performed this time. The fourth law\nof behavior change— make it satisfying —increases the odds\nthat a behavior will be repeated next time. It completes the\nhabit loop.\nBut there is a trick. W e are not looking for just any type\nof satisfaction. W e are looking for immediate satisfaction.\nTHE MISMA TCH BETWEEN IMMEDIA TE AND DELA YED\nREWARDS\nImagine you’re an animal roaming the plains of A frica—a\ngiraﬀe or an elephant or a lion. On any given day , most of\nyour decisions have an immediate impact. Y ou are always\nthinking about what to eat or where to sleep or how to\navoid a predator . You are constantly focused on the present\nor the very near future. Y ou live in what scientists call an\nimmediate-return environment  because your actions\ninstantly deliver clear and immediate outcomes.\nNow switch back to your human self . In modern society ,\nmany of the choices you make today will not beneﬁt you\nimmediately . If you do a good job at work, you’ll get a\npaycheck in a few weeks. If you exercise today , perhaps you\nwon’t be overweight next year . If you save money now ,\nmaybe you’ll have enough for retirement decades from\nnow. You live in what scientists call a delayed-return\nenvironment  because you can work for years before your\nactions deliver the intended payoﬀ .\nThe human brain did not evolve for life in a delayed-\nreturn environment. The earliest remains of modern\nhumans, known as Homo sapiens sapiens , are\napproximately two hundred thousand years old. These were\nthe ﬁrst humans to have a brain relatively similar to ours.\nIn particular , the neocortex—the newest part of the brain\nand the region responsible for higher functions like\nlanguage—was roughly the same size two hundred\nthousand years ago as today . You are walking around with\nthe same hardware as your P aleolithic ancestors.\nIt is only recently—during the last ﬁve hundred years or\nso—that society has shifted to a predominantly delayed-\nreturn environment. * Compared to the age of the brain,\nmodern society is brand-new . In the last one hundred years,\nwe have seen the rise of the car , the airplane, the\ntelevision, the personal computer , the internet, the\nsmartphone, and Beyoncé. The world has",

    "text": ", next time.”\nPleasure teaches your brain that a behavior is worth\nremembering and repeating.\nTake the story of chewing gum. Chewing gum had been\nsold commercially throughout the 1800s, but it wasn’t until\nWrigley launched in 1891 that it became a worldwide habit.\nEarly versions were made from relatively bland resins—\nchewy , but not tasty . Wrigley revolutionized the industry by\nadding ﬂavors like Spearmint and Juicy Fruit, which made\nthe product ﬂavorful and fun to use. Then they went a step\nfurther and began pushing chewing gum as a pathway to a\nclean mouth. Advertisements told readers to “Refresh Y our\nTaste.”\nTasty ﬂavors and the feeling of a fresh mouth provided\nlittle bits of immediate reinforcement and made the\nproduct satisfying to use. Consumption skyrocketed, and\nWrigley became the largest chewing gum company in the\nworld.\nToothpaste had a similar trajectory . Manufacturers\nenjoyed great success when they added ﬂavors like\nspearmint, peppermint, and cinnamon to their products.\nThese ﬂavors don’t improve the eﬀectiveness of toothpaste.\nThey simply create a “clean mouth” feel and make the\nexperience of brushing your teeth more pleasurable. My\nwife actually stopped using Sensodyne because she didn’t\nlike the aftertaste. She switched to a brand with a stronger\nmint ﬂavor , which proved to be more satisfying.\nConversely , if an experience is not satisfying, we have\nlittle reason to repeat it. In my research, I came across the\nstory of a woman who had a narcissistic relative who drove\nher nuts. In an attempt to spend less time with this\negomaniac, she acted as dull and as boring as possible\nwhenever he was around. W ithin a few encounters, he\nstarted avoiding her because he found her so uninteresting.\nStories like these are evidence of the Cardinal Rule of\nBehavior Change: What is rewarded is repeated. What is\npunished is avoided.  You learn what to do in the future\nbased on what you were rewarded for doing (or punished\nfor doing) in the past. P ositive emotions cultivate habits.\nNegative emotions destroy them.\nThe ﬁrst three laws of behavior change— make it obvious,\nmake it attractive, and make it",

    "text": "Toothpaste had a similar trajectory . Manufacturers\nenjoyed great success when they added ﬂavors like\nspearmint, peppermint, and cinnamon to their products.\nThese ﬂavors don’t improve the eﬀectiveness of toothpaste.\nThey simply create a “clean mouth” feel and make the\nexperience of brushing your teeth more pleasurable. My\nwife actually stopped using Sensodyne because she didn’t\nlike the aftertaste. She switched to a brand with a stronger\nmint ﬂavor , which proved to be more satisfying.\nConversely , if an experience is not satisfying, we have\nlittle reason to repeat it. In my research, I came across the\nstory of a woman who had a narcissistic relative who drove\nher nuts. In an attempt to spend less time with this\negomaniac, she acted as dull and as boring as possible\nwhenever he was around. W ithin a few encounters, he\nstarted avoiding her because he found her so uninteresting.\nStories like these are evidence of the Cardinal Rule of\nBehavior Change: What is rewarded is repeated. What is\npunished is avoided.  You learn what to do in the future\nbased on",

    "text": " what you were rewarded for doing (or punished\nfor doing) in the past. P ositive emotions cultivate habits.\nNegative emotions destroy them.\nThe ﬁrst three laws of behavior change— make it obvious,\nmake it attractive, and make it easy —increase the odds\nthat a behavior will be performed this time. The fourth law\nof behavior change— make it satisfying —increases the odds\nthat a behavior will be repeated next time. It completes the\nhabit loop.\nBut there is a trick. W e are not looking for just any type\nof satisfaction. W e are looking for immediate satisfaction.\nTHE MISMA TCH BETWEEN IMMEDIA TE AND DELA YED\nREWARDS\nImagine you’re an animal roaming the plains of A frica—a\ngiraﬀe or an elephant or a lion. On any given day , most of\nyour decisions have an immediate impact. Y ou are always\nthinking about what to eat or where to sleep or how to\navoid a predator . You are constantly focused on the present\nor the very near future. Y ou live in what scientists call an\nimmediate-return environment  because your actions\ninstantly deliver clear and immediate outcomes.\nNow switch back to your human self . In modern society ,\nmany of the choices you make today will not beneﬁt you\nimmediately . If you do a good job at work, you’ll get a\npaycheck in a few weeks. If you exercise today , perhaps you\nwon’t be overweight next year . If you save money now ,\nmaybe you’ll have enough for retirement decades from\nnow. You live in what scientists call a delayed-return\nenvironment  because you can work for years before your\nactions deliver the intended payoﬀ .\nThe human brain did not evolve for life in a delayed-\nreturn environment. The earliest remains of modern\nhumans, known as Homo sapiens sapiens , are\napproximately two hundred thousand years old. These were\nthe ﬁrst humans to have a brain relatively similar to ours.\nIn particular , the neocortex—the newest part of the brain\nand the region responsible for higher functions like\nlanguage—was roughly the same size two hundred\nthousand years ago as today . You are walking around with\nthe same hardware as your P aleolithic ancestors.\nIt is only recently—during the last ﬁve hundred years or\nso—that society has shifted to a predominantly delayed-\nreturn environment. * Compared to the age of the brain",

The fourth law\nof behavior change— make it satisfying —increases the odds\nthat a behavior will be repeated next time. It completes the\nhabit loop.\nBut there is a trick.

Y ou live in what scientists call an\nimmediate-return environment  because your actions\ninstantly deliver clear and immediate outcomes.\nNow switch back to your human self . In modern society ,\nmany of the choices you make today will not beneﬁt you\nimmediately . If you do a good job at work, you’ll get a\npaycheck in a few weeks. If you exercise today , perhaps you\nwon’t be overweight next year . If you save money now ,\nmaybe you’ll have enough for retirement decades from\nnow.

    "text": ",\nmodern society is brand-new . In the last one hundred years,\nwe have seen the rise of the car , the airplane, the\ntelevision, the personal computer , the internet, the\nsmartphone, and Beyoncé. The world has changed much in\nrecent years, but human nature has changed little.\nSimilar to other animals on the A frican savannah, our\nancestors spent their days responding to grave threats,\nsecuring the next meal, and taking shelter from a storm. It\nmade sense to place a high value on instant gratiﬁcation.\nThe distant future was less of a concern. And after\nthousands of generations in an immediate-return\nenvironment, our brains evolved to prefer quick payoﬀs to\nlong-term ones.\nBehavioral economists refer to this tendency as time\ninconsistency . That is, the way your brain evaluates\nrewards is inconsistent across time. * You value the present\nmore than the future. Usually , this tendency serves us well.\nA reward that is certain  right now is typically worth more\nthan one that is merely possible  in the future. But\noccasionally , our bias toward instant gratiﬁcation causes\nproblems.\nWhy would someone smoke if they know it increases the\nrisk of lung cancer? Why would someone overeat when they\nknow it increases their risk of obesity? Why would someone\nhave unsafe sex if they know it can result in sexually\ntransmitted disease? Once you understand how the brain\nprioritizes rewards, the answers become clear: the\nconsequences of bad habits are delayed while the rewards\nare immediate. Smoking might kill you in ten years, but it\nreduces stress and eases your nicotine cravings now.\nOvereating is harmful in the long run but appetizing in the\nmoment. Sex—safe or not—provides pleasure right away .\nDisease and infection won’t show up for days or weeks,\neven years.\nEvery habit produces multiple outcomes across time.\nUnfortunately , these outcomes are often misaligned. W ith\nour bad habits, the immediate outcome usually feels good,\nbut the ultimate outcome feels bad. W ith good habits, it is\nthe reverse: the immediate outcome is unenjoyable, but the\nultimate outcome feels good. The French economist\nFrédéric Bastiat explained the problem clearly when he\nwrote, “It almost always happens that when the immediate\nconsequence is favorable, the later consequences are\ndisastrous, and vice versa. . . . Often, the sweeter the ﬁrst\nfruit of a habit, the more bitter are its later fruits.”\nPut another way , the costs of your good habits are in the\npresent. The costs of your bad habits are in the future.\nThe brain’s tendency to prioritize the present moment\nmeans you can’t rely on good intentions. When you make a\nplan—to lose weight, write a book, or learn a language—\nyou are actually making plans for your future self . And\nwhen you envision what you want your life to be like, it is\neasy to see the value in taking actions with long-term\nbeneﬁts. W e all want better lives for our future selves.\nHowever , when the moment of decision arrives, instant\ngratiﬁcation usually wins. Y ou are no longer making a\nchoice for Future Y ou, who dreams of being ﬁtter or\nwealthier or happier . You are choosing for Present Y ou, who\nwants to be full, pampered, and entertained. As a general\nrule, the more immediate pleasure you get from an action,\nthe more strongly you should question whether it aligns\nwith your long-term goals. *\nWith a fuller understanding of what causes our brain to\nrepeat some behaviors and avoid others, let’s update the\nCardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is immediately\nrewarded is repeated. What is immediately  punished is\navoided.\nOur preference for instant gratiﬁcation reveals an\nimportant truth about success: because of how we are\nwired, most people will spend all day chasing quick hits of\nsatisfaction. The road less traveled is the road of delayed\ngratiﬁcation. If you’re willing to wait for the rewards, you’ll\nface less competition and often get a bigger payoﬀ . As the\nsaying goes, the last mile is always the least crowded.\nThis is precisely what research has shown. People who\nare better at delaying gratiﬁcation have higher SA T scores,\nlower levels of substance abuse, lower likelihood of obesity ,\nbetter responses to stress, and superior social skills. W e’ve\nall seen this play out in our own lives. If you delay watching\ntelevision and get your homework done, you’ll generally\nlearn more and get better grades. If you don’t buy desserts\nand chips at the store, you’ll often eat healthier food when\nyou get",

    "text": ",\nmodern society is brand-new . In the last one hundred years,\nwe have seen the rise of the car , the airplane, the\ntelevision, the personal computer , the internet, the\nsmartphone, and Beyoncé. The world has changed much in\nrecent years, but human nature has changed little.\nSimilar to other animals on the A frican savannah, our\nancestors spent their days responding to grave threats,\nsecuring the next meal, and taking shelter from a storm. It\nmade sense to place a high value on instant gratiﬁcation.\nThe distant future was less of a concern. And after\nthousands of generations in an immediate-return\nenvironment, our brains evolved to prefer quick payoﬀs to\nlong-term ones.\nBehavioral economists refer to this tendency as time\ninconsistency . That is, the way your brain evaluates\nrewards is inconsistent across time. * You value the present\nmore than the future. Usually , this tendency serves us well.\nA reward that is certain  right now is typically worth more\nthan one that is merely possible  in the future. But\noccasionally , our bias toward instant gratiﬁcation causes\nproblems.\nWhy would someone smoke if they know it increases the\nrisk of lung cancer? Why would someone overeat when they\nknow it increases their risk of obesity? Why would someone\nhave unsafe sex if they know it can result in sexually\ntransmitted disease? Once you understand how the brain\nprioritizes rewards, the answers become clear: the\nconsequences of bad habits are delayed while the rewards\nare immediate. Smoking might kill you in ten years, but it\nreduces stress and eases your nicotine cravings now.\nOvereating is harmful in the long run but appetizing in the\nmoment. Sex—safe or not—provides pleasure right away .\nDisease and infection won’t show up for days or weeks,\neven years.\nEvery habit produces multiple outcomes across time.\nUnfortunately , these outcomes are often misaligned. W ith\nour bad habits, the immediate outcome usually feels good,\nbut the ultimate outcome feels bad. W ith good habits, it is\nthe reverse: the immediate outcome is unenjoyable, but the\nultimate outcome feels good. The French economist\nFrédéric Bastiat explained the problem clearly when he\nwrote, “It almost always happens that when the immediate\nconsequence is favorable, the later consequences are\ndisastrous,",

In the last one hundred years,\nwe have seen the rise of the car , the airplane, the\ntelevision, the personal computer , the internet, the\nsmartphone, and Beyoncé. The world has changed much in\nrecent years, but human nature has changed little.\nSimilar to other animals on the A frican savannah, our\nancestors spent their days responding to grave threats,\nsecuring the next meal, and taking shelter from a storm. It\nmade sense to place a high value on instant gratiﬁcation.\nThe distant future was less of a concern. And after\nthousands of generations in an immediate-return\nenvironment, our brains evolved to prefer quick payoﬀs to\nlong-term ones.\nBehavioral economists refer to this tendency as time\ninconsistency . That is, the way your brain evaluates\nrewards is inconsistent across time. * You value the present\nmore than the future. Usually , this tendency serves us well.\nA reward that is certain  right now is typically worth more\nthan one that is merely possible  in the future. But\noccasionally , our bias toward instant gratiﬁcation causes\nproblems.\nWhy would someone smoke if",

But\noccasionally , our bias toward instant gratiﬁcation causes\nproblems.\nWhy would someone smoke if they know it increases the\nrisk of lung cancer? Why would someone overeat when they\nknow it increases their risk of obesity? Why would someone\nhave unsafe sex if they know it can result in sexually\ntransmitted disease?

Sex—safe or not—provides pleasure right away .\nDisease and infection won’t show up for days or weeks,\neven years.\nEvery habit produces multiple outcomes across time.\nUnfortunately , these outcomes are often misaligned. W ith\nour bad habits, the immediate outcome usually feels good,\nbut the ultimate outcome feels bad. W ith good habits, it is\nthe reverse: the immediate outcome is unenjoyable, but",

    "text": " the\nultimate outcome feels good. The French economist\nFrédéric Bastiat explained the problem clearly when he\nwrote, “It almost always happens that when the immediate\nconsequence is favorable, the later consequences are\ndisastrous, and vice versa. . . . Often, the sweeter the ﬁrst\nfruit of a habit, the more bitter are its later fruits.”\nPut another way , the costs of your good habits are in the\npresent. The costs of your bad habits are in the future.\nThe brain’s tendency to prioritize the present moment\nmeans you can’t rely on good intentions. When you make a\nplan—to lose weight, write a book, or learn a language—\nyou are actually making plans for your future self . And\nwhen you envision what you want your life to be like, it is\neasy to see the value in taking actions with long-term\nbeneﬁts. W e all want better lives for our future selves.\nHowever , when the moment of decision arrives, instant\ngratiﬁcation usually wins. Y ou are no longer making a\nchoice for Future Y ou, who dreams of being ﬁtter or\nwealthier or happier . You are choosing for Present Y ou, who\nwants to be full, pampered, and entertained. As a general\nrule, the more immediate pleasure you get from an action,\nthe more strongly you should question whether it aligns\nwith your long-term goals. *\nWith a fuller understanding of what causes our brain to\nrepeat some behaviors and avoid others, let’s update the\nCardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is immediately\nrewarded is repeated. What is immediately  punished is\navoided.\nOur preference for instant gratiﬁcation reveals an\nimportant truth about success: because of how we are\nwired, most people will spend all day chasing quick hits of\nsatisfaction. The road less traveled is the road of delayed\ngratiﬁcation. If you’re willing to wait for the rewards, you’ll\nface less competition and often get a bigger payoﬀ . As the\nsaying goes, the last mile is always the least crowded.\nThis is precisely what research has shown. People who\nare better at delaying gratiﬁcation have higher SA T scores,\nlower levels of substance abuse, lower likelihood of obesity ,\nbetter responses to stress, and superior social skills.

    "text": " the\nultimate outcome feels good. The French economist\nFrédéric Bastiat explained the problem clearly when he\nwrote, “It almost always happens that when the immediate\nconsequence is favorable, the later consequences are\ndisastrous, and vice versa. . . . Often, the sweeter the ﬁrst\nfruit of a habit, the more bitter are its later fruits.”\nPut another way , the costs of your good habits are in the\npresent. The costs of your bad habits are in the future.\nThe brain’s tendency to prioritize the present moment\nmeans you can’t rely on good intentions. When you make a\nplan—to lose weight, write a book, or learn a language—\nyou are actually making plans for your future self . And\nwhen you envision what you want your life to be like, it is\neasy to see the value in taking actions with long-term\nbeneﬁts. W e all want better lives for our future selves.\nHowever , when the moment of decision arrives, instant\ngratiﬁcation usually wins. Y ou are no longer making a\nchoice for Future Y ou, who dreams of being ﬁtter or\nwealthier or happier . You are choosing for Present Y",

    "text": " moment of decision arrives, instant\ngratiﬁcation usually wins. Y ou are no longer making a\nchoice for Future Y ou, who dreams of being ﬁtter or\nwealthier or happier . You are choosing for Present Y ou, who\nwants to be full, pampered, and entertained. As a general\nrule, the more immediate pleasure you get from an action,\nthe more strongly you should question whether it aligns\nwith your long-term goals. *\nWith a fuller understanding of what causes our brain to\nrepeat some behaviors and avoid others, let’s update the\nCardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is immediately\nrewarded is repeated. What is immediately  punished is\navoided.\nOur preference for instant gratiﬁcation reveals an\nimportant truth about success: because of how we are\nwired, most people will spend all day chasing quick hits of\nsatisfaction. The road less traveled is the road of delayed\ngratiﬁcation. If you’re willing to wait for the rewards, you’ll\nface less competition and often get a bigger payoﬀ . As the\nsaying goes, the last mile is always the least crowded.\nThis is precisely what research has shown.",

    "text": " own lives. If you delay watching\ntelevision and get your homework done, you’ll generally\nlearn more and get better grades. If you don’t buy desserts\nand chips at the store, you’ll often eat healthier food when\nyou get home. A t some point, success in nearly every ﬁeld\nrequires you to ignore an immediate reward in favor of a\ndelayed reward.\nHere’s the problem: most people know  that delaying\ngratiﬁcation is the wise approach. They want the beneﬁts\nof good habits: to be healthy , productive, at peace. But\nthese outcomes are seldom top-of -mind at the decisive\nmoment. Thankfully , it’s possible to train yourself to delay\ngratiﬁcation—but you need to work with the grain of\nhuman nature, not against it. The best way to do this is to\nadd a little bit of immediate pleasure to the habits that pay\noﬀ in the long-run and a little bit of immediate pain to ones\nthat don’t.\nHOW TO TURN INST ANT GRA TIFICA TION TO Y OUR\nADVANTAGE\nThe vital thing in getting a habit to stick is to feel\nsuccessful—even if it’s in a small way . The feeling of\nsuccess is a signal that your habit paid oﬀ and that the\nwork was worth the eﬀort.\nIn a perfect world, the reward for a good habit is the\nhabit itself . In the real world, good habits tend to feel\nworthwhile only after they have provided you with\nsomething. Early on, it’s all sacriﬁce. Y ou’ve gone to the\ngym a few times, but you’re not stronger or ﬁtter or faster\n—at least, not in any noticeable sense. It’s only months\nlater, once you shed a few pounds or your arms gain some\ndeﬁnition, that it becomes easier to exercise for its own\nsake. In the beginning, you need a reason to stay on track.\nThis is why immediate rewards are essential. They keep\nyou excited while the delayed rewards accumulate in the\nbackground.\nWhat we’re really talking about here—when we’re\ndiscussing immediate rewards—is the ending of a behavior .\nThe ending of any experience is vital because we tend to\nremember it more than other phases. Y ou want the ending\nof your habit to be satisfying. The best approach is to use\nreinforcement , which refers to the process of using an\nimmediate reward to increase the rate of a behavior . Habit\nstacking, which we covered in Chapter 5, ties your habit to\nan immediate cue, which makes it obvious when to start.\nReinforcement ties your habit to an immediate reward,\nwhich makes it satisfying when you ﬁnish.\nImmediate reinforcement can be especially helpful when\ndealing with habits of avoidance , which are behaviors you\nwant to stop doing. It can be challenging to stick with\nhabits like “no frivolous purchases” or “no alcohol this\nmonth” because nothing happens when you skip happy\nhour drinks or don’t buy that pair of shoes. It can be hard\nto feel satisﬁed when there is no action in the ﬁrst place.\nAll you’re doing is resisting temptation, and there isn’t\nmuch satisfying about that.\nOne solution is to turn the situation on its head. Y ou want\nto make avoidance visible. Open a savings account and\nlabel it for something you want—maybe “Leather Jacket.”\nWhenever you pass on a purchase, put the same amount of\nmoney in the account. Skip your morning latte? Transfer\n$5. P ass on another month of Netﬂix? Move $10 over . It’s\nlike creating a loyalty program for yourself . The immediate\nreward of seeing yourself save money toward the leather\njacket feels a lot better than being deprived. Y ou are\nmaking it satisfying to do nothing.\nOne of my readers and his wife used a similar setup.\nThey wanted to stop eating out so much and start cooking\ntogether more. They labeled their savings account “Trip to\nEurope.” Whenever they skipped going out to eat, they\ntransferred $50 into the account. A t the end of the year ,\nthey put the money toward the vacation.\nIt is worth noting that it is important to select short-term\nrewards that reinforce your identity rather than ones that\nconﬂict with it. Buying a new jacket is ﬁne if you’re trying\nto lose weight or read more books, but it doesn’t work if\nyou’re trying to budget and save money . Instead, taking a\nbubble bath or going on a leisurely walk are good examples\nof rewarding yourself with free time, which aligns with\nyour ultimate goal of more freedom and ﬁnancial\nindependence. Similarly , if your reward for exercising is",

    "text": " own lives. If you delay watching\ntelevision and get your homework done, you’ll generally\nlearn more and get better grades. If you don’t buy desserts\nand chips at the store, you’ll often eat healthier food when\nyou get home. A t some point, success in nearly every ﬁeld\nrequires you to ignore an immediate reward in favor of a\ndelayed reward.\nHere’s the problem: most people know  that delaying\ngratiﬁcation is the wise approach. They want the beneﬁts\nof good habits: to be healthy , productive, at peace. But\nthese outcomes are seldom top-of -mind at the decisive\nmoment. Thankfully , it’s possible to train yourself to delay\ngratiﬁcation—but you need to work with the grain of\nhuman nature, not against it. The best way to do this is to\nadd a little bit of immediate pleasure to the habits that pay\noﬀ in the long-run and a little bit of immediate pain to ones\nthat don’t.\nHOW TO TURN INST ANT GRA TIFICA TION TO Y OUR\nADVANTAGE\nThe vital thing in getting a habit to stick is to feel\nsuccessful—even if it’s in a small way . The feeling of\nsuccess is a signal that your habit paid oﬀ and that the\nwork was worth the eﬀort.\nIn a perfect world, the reward for a good habit is the\nhabit itself . In the real world, good habits tend to feel\nworthwhile only after they have provided you with\nsomething. Early on, it’s all sacriﬁce. Y ou’ve gone to the\ngym a few times, but you’re not stronger or ﬁtter or faster\n—at least, not in any noticeable sense. It’s only months\nlater, once you shed a few pounds or your arms gain some\ndeﬁnition, that it becomes easier to exercise for its own\nsake. In the beginning, you need a reason to stay on track.\nThis is why immediate rewards are essential. They keep\nyou excited while the delayed rewards accumulate in the\nbackground.\nWhat we’re really talking about here—when we’re\ndiscussing immediate rewards—is the ending of a behavior .\nThe ending of any experience is vital because we tend to\nremember it more than other phases. Y ou want the ending\nof your habit to be satisfying. The best approach is to use",

Y ou want the ending\nof your habit to be satisfying. The best approach is to use\nreinforcement , which refers to the process of using an\nimmediate reward to increase the rate of a behavior . Habit\nstacking, which we covered in Chapter 5, ties your habit to\nan immediate cue, which makes it obvious when to start.\nReinforcement ties your habit to an immediate reward,\nwhich makes it satisfying when you ﬁnish.\nImmediate reinforcement can be especially helpful when\ndealing with habits of avoidance , which are behaviors you\nwant to stop doing. It can be challenging to stick with\nhabits like “no frivolous purchases” or “no alcohol this\nmonth” because nothing happens when you skip happy\nhour drinks or don’t buy that pair of shoes. It can be hard\nto feel satisﬁed when there is no action in the ﬁrst place.\nAll you’re doing is resisting temptation, and there isn’t\nmuch satisfying about that.\nOne solution is to turn the situation on its head. Y ou want\nto make avoidance visible. Open a savings account and\nlabel it for something you want—maybe “Leather Jacket.”\nWhenever you pass on a purchase, put the same amount of\nmoney in the account. Skip your morning latte? Transfer\n$5. P ass on another month of Netﬂix? Move $10 over . It’s\nlike creating a loyalty program for yourself . The immediate\nreward of seeing yourself save money toward the leather\njacket feels a lot better than being deprived. Y ou are\nmaking it satisfying to do nothing.\nOne of my readers and his wife used a similar setup.\nThey wanted to stop eating out so much and start cooking\ntogether more. They labeled their savings account “Trip to\nEurope.” Whenever they skipped going out to eat, they\ntransferred $50 into the account. A t the end of the year ,\nthey put the money toward the vacation.\nIt is worth noting that it is important to select short-term\nrewards that reinforce your identity rather than ones that\nconﬂict with it. Buying a new jacket is ﬁne if you’re trying\nto lose weight or read more books, but it doesn’t work if\nyou’re trying to budget and save money . Instead, taking",

    "text": "discussing immediate rewards—is the ending of a behavior .\nThe ending of any experience is vital because we tend to\nremember it more than other phases. Y ou want the ending\nof your habit to be satisfying. The best approach is to use\nreinforcement , which refers to the process of using an\nimmediate reward to increase the rate of a behavior . Habit\nstacking, which we covered in Chapter 5, ties your habit to\nan immediate cue, which makes it obvious when to start.\nReinforcement ties your habit to an immediate reward,\nwhich makes it satisfying when you ﬁnish.\nImmediate reinforcement can be especially helpful when\ndealing with habits of avoidance , which are behaviors you\nwant to stop doing. It can be challenging to stick with\nhabits like “no frivolous purchases” or “no alcohol this\nmonth” because nothing happens when you skip happy\nhour drinks or don’t buy that pair of shoes. It can be hard\nto feel satisﬁed when there is no action in the ﬁrst place.\nAll you’re doing is resisting temptation, and there isn’t\nmuch satisfying about that.\nOne solution is to turn the situation on its head. Y ou want\nto make avoidance visible",

    "text": "ed when there is no action in the ﬁrst place.\nAll you’re doing is resisting temptation, and there isn’t\nmuch satisfying about that.\nOne solution is to turn the situation on its head. Y ou want\nto make avoidance visible. Open a savings account and\nlabel it for something you want—maybe “Leather Jacket.”\nWhenever you pass on a purchase, put the same amount of\nmoney in the account. Skip your morning latte? Transfer\n$5. P ass on another month of Netﬂix? Move $10 over . It’s\nlike creating a loyalty program for yourself . The immediate\nreward of seeing yourself save money toward the leather\njacket feels a lot better than being deprived. Y ou are\nmaking it satisfying to do nothing.\nOne of my readers and his wife used a similar setup.\nThey wanted to stop eating out so much and start cooking\ntogether more. They labeled their savings account “Trip to\nEurope.” Whenever they skipped going out to eat, they\ntransferred $50 into the account. A t the end of the year ,\nthey put the money toward the vacation.\nIt is worth noting that it is important to select short-term\nrewards that reinforce your identity rather than ones",

    "text": " a\nbubble bath or going on a leisurely walk are good examples\nof rewarding yourself with free time, which aligns with\nyour ultimate goal of more freedom and ﬁnancial\nindependence. Similarly , if your reward for exercising is\neating a bowl of ice cream, then you’re casting votes for\nconﬂicting identities, and it ends up being a wash. Instead,\nmaybe your reward is a massage, which is both a luxury\nand a vote toward taking care of your body . Now the short-\nterm reward is aligned with your long-term vision of being\na healthy person.\nEventually , as intrinsic rewards like a better mood, more\nenergy , and reduced stress kick in, you’ll become less\nconcerned with chasing the secondary reward. The identity\nitself becomes the reinforcer . You do it because it’s who you\nare and it feels good to be you. The more a habit becomes\npart of your life, the less you need outside encouragement\nto follow through. Incentives can start a habit. Identity\nsustains a habit.\nThat said, it takes time for the evidence to accumulate\nand a new identity to emerge. Immediate reinforcement\nhelps maintain motivation in the short term while you’re\nwaiting for the long-term rewards to arrive.\nIn summary , a habit needs to be enjoyable for it to last.\nSimple bits of reinforcement—like soap that smells great or\ntoothpaste that has a refreshing mint ﬂavor or seeing $50\nhit your savings account—can oﬀer the immediate pleasure\nyou need to enjoy a habit. And change is easy when it is\nenjoyable.\nChapter Summary\nThe 4th Law of Behavior Change is make it satisfying .\nWe are more likely to repeat a behavior when the\nexperience is satisfying.\nThe human brain evolved to prioritize immediate\nrewards over delayed rewards.\nThe Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is\nimmediately rewarded is repeated. What is\nimmediately punished is avoided.\nTo get a habit to stick you need to feel immediately\nsuccessful—even if it’s in a small way .\nThe ﬁrst three laws of behavior change— make it\nobvious, make it attractive, and make it easy —increase\nthe odds that a behavior will be performed this time.\nThe fourth law of behavior change— make it satisfying\n—increases the odds that a behavior will be repeated\nnext time.",

    "text": " a\nbubble bath or going on a leisurely walk are good examples\nof rewarding yourself with free time, which aligns with\nyour ultimate goal of more freedom and ﬁnancial\nindependence. Similarly , if your reward for exercising is\neating a bowl of ice cream, then you’re casting votes for\nconﬂicting identities, and it ends up being a wash. Instead,\nmaybe your reward is a massage, which is both a luxury\nand a vote toward taking care of your body . Now the short-\nterm reward is aligned with your long-term vision of being\na healthy person.\nEventually , as intrinsic rewards like a better mood, more\nenergy , and reduced stress kick in, you’ll become less\nconcerned with chasing the secondary reward. The identity\nitself becomes the reinforcer . You do it because it’s who you\nare and it feels good to be you. The more a habit becomes\npart of your life, the less you need outside encouragement\nto follow through. Incentives can start a habit. Identity\nsustains a habit.\nThat said, it takes time for the evidence to accumulate\nand a new identity to emerge. Immediate reinforcement\nhelps maintain motivation in the short term while you’re\nwaiting for the long-term rewards to arrive.\nIn summary , a habit needs to be enjoyable for it to last.\nSimple bits of reinforcement—like soap that smells great or\ntoothpaste that has a refreshing mint ﬂavor or seeing $50\nhit your savings account—can oﬀer the immediate pleasure\nyou need to enjoy a habit. And change is easy when it is\nenjoyable.\nChapter Summary\nThe 4th Law of Behavior Change is make it satisfying .\nWe are more likely to repeat a behavior when the\nexperience is satisfying.\nThe human brain evolved to prioritize immediate\nrewards over delayed rewards.\nThe Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is\nimmediately rewarded is repeated. What is\nimmediately punished is avoided.\nTo get a habit to stick you need to feel immediately\nsuccessful—even if it’s in a small way .\nThe ﬁrst three laws of behavior change— make it\nobvious, make it attractive, and make it easy —increase\nthe odds that a behavior will be performed this time.\nThe fourth law of behavior change— make it satisfying\n—increases the odds that a behavior will be repeated\nnext time.",

    "text": " a\nbubble bath or going on a leisurely walk are good examples\nof rewarding yourself with free time, which aligns with\nyour ultimate goal of more freedom and ﬁnancial\nindependence. Similarly , if your reward for exercising is\neating a bowl of ice cream, then you’re casting votes for\nconﬂicting identities, and it ends up being a wash. Instead,\nmaybe your reward is a massage, which is both a luxury\nand a vote toward taking care of your body . Now the short-\nterm reward is aligned with your long-term vision of being\na healthy person.\nEventually , as intrinsic rewards like a better mood, more\nenergy , and reduced stress kick in, you’ll become less\nconcerned with chasing the secondary reward. The identity\nitself becomes the reinforcer . You do it because it’s who you\nare and it feels good to be you. The more a habit becomes\npart of your life, the less you need outside encouragement\nto follow through. Incentives can start a habit. Identity\nsustains a habit.\nThat said, it takes time for the evidence to accumulate\nand a new identity to emerge. Immediate reinforcement\nhelps maintain motivation in the short term",

Immediate reinforcement\nhelps maintain motivation in the short term while you’re\nwaiting for the long-term rewards to arrive.\nIn summary , a habit needs to be enjoyable for it to last.\nSimple bits of reinforcement—like soap that smells great or\ntoothpaste that has a refreshing mint ﬂavor or seeing $50\nhit your savings account—can oﬀer the immediate pleasure\nyou need to enjoy a habit. And change is easy when it is\nenjoyable.\nChapter Summary\nThe 4th Law of Behavior Change is make it satisfying .\nWe are more likely to repeat a behavior when the\nexperience is satisfying.\nThe human brain evolved to prioritize immediate\nrewards over delayed rewards.\nThe Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is\nimmediately rewarded is repeated. What is\nimmediately punished is avoided.\nTo get a habit to stick you need to feel immediately\nsuccessful—even if it’s in a small way .\nThe ﬁrst three laws of behavior change— make it\nobvious, make it attractive, and make it easy",
