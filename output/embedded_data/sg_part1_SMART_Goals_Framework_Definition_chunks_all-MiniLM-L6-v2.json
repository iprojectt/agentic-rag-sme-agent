What actions  will you \ntake?  \nM Measurable  What data will measure the goal? (How much? How \nwell?  \nA Achievable  Is the goal doable?  Do you have the necessary skills \nand resources?  \nR Relevant  How does the goal align with broader goals? Why is \nthe result important?  \nT Time -Bound  What is the time frame for accomplishing the goal?  \n \nHow do I decide the right scope for my SMART Goals?  (How big? How many?)  \n \nSMART goals are meant to address all of your major job responsibilities.  \nRemember, goals are intended to focus attention and resources on what is most important \nso that you can be successful in achieving your priorities. SMART Goals are goals for your \nday-to-day job.  \n \n Common types of goals are to:  \no Increase something  \no Make something  \no Improve something  \no Reduce something  \no Save something  \no Develop someone  (yourself!)  \n \nWhere to start?  \n1. Start by thinking about your whole job and the broad areas (or “buckets”) of \nresponsibility and results for which you are accountable.  \n2. Develop a  goal statement for each bucket.   To get the scope right, remember to \nfocus on end results not tasks.  \nPerformance Appraisal Planning 2016 -2017    SMART Goals: A How to  Guide  \n \n \n4 \n 3. Goals should be high level enough to encompass the core outcomes for which you \nare responsible, but specific and clear enough so you will be able to measu re \nsuccess.  \n4.  Goals  should be on-going job  responsibilities and any new projects, assignments, \npriorities, or initiatives that are specific to this performance cycle.  \n5. Having too many goals can be an indicator that your goals are scoped at too low a \nlevel an d are focused more on tasks than on end results.  \n6. If it seems that your goals are becoming too numerous and task -oriented, it may be \nhelpful to consider combining several goal statements into a broader outcome area.  \n \nHow to write your S -M-A-R-T goal  \n \nS – Specific  \nWhen setting a goal, be specific about what you want to accomplish. Think about this as the \nmission statement for your goal. This isn’t a detailed list of how you’re going to meet a goal, but \nit should include an answer to the popular ‘w’ question s: \n Who – Consider who needs to be involved to achieve the goal (this is especially \nimportant when you’re working on a group project).  \n What – Think about exactly what you are trying to accomplish and don’t be afraid to get \nvery detailed.  \n When – You’ll get m ore specific about this question under the “time -bound” section of \ndefining S.M.A.R.T. goals, but you should at least set a time frame.  \n Where – This question may not always apply, especially if you’re setting personal goals, \nbut if there’s a location or re levant event, identify it here.  \n Which – Determine any related obstacles or requirements. This question can be \nbeneficial in deciding if your goal is realistic. For example, if the goal is to open a baking \nbusiness, but you’ve never baked anything before, t hat might be an issue. As a result, \nyou may refine the specifics of the goal to be “Learn how to bake in order to open a \nbaking business.\"  \n Why – What is the reason for the goal? When it comes to using this method for \nemployees, the answer will likely be al ong the lines of company advancement or career \ndevelopment.  \n \nPerformance Appraisal Planning 2016 -2017    SMART Goals: A How to  Guide  \n \n \n5 \n    “S” actions may include:  \n \nOversee  Update  Write  \nCoordinate  Upgrade  Process  \nSupervise  Develop  Provide  \nManage  Create  Maintain  \nPlan  Implement  Reconcile  \nSupport  Evaluate  Direct  \nTransition  Produce  Administer  \n \n Note that this list does not include verbs like “improve,” “reduce,” or “increase” (e.g. \n“Improve customer service” or “reduce cost.”   These imply the direction that you want a \nresult to move in, but don’t do much to explain the",

As a result, \nyou may refine the specifics of the goal to be “Learn how to bake in order to open a \nbaking business.\"  \n Why – What is the reason for the goal?

    "text": " “improve,” “reduce,” or “increase” (e.g. \n“Improve customer service” or “reduce cost.”   These imply the direction that you want a \nresult to move in, but don’t do much to explain the role o r specific action that you will \ntake to accomplish this change.  \n \nM – Measurable  \nWhat metrics are you going to use to determine if you meet the goal? This makes a goal more \ntangible because it provides a way to measure progress. If it’s a project that’s goi ng to take a \nfew months to complete, then set some milestones by considering specific tasks to accomplish. \nMilestones are a series of steps along the way that when added up will result in the completion \nof your main goal.  \n As the “M” in SMART states, there should be a source of information to measure or \ndetermine whether a goal has been achieved.  \n The M is a direct (or possibly indirect) indicator of what success for a particular goal will \nlook like.  \n Sometimes measurement is dif ficult and managers  and employe es will need to work \ntogether to identify the most relevant and feasible data sources and collection methods.  \n Data collection efforts needed to measure a goal can be  included in that goal’s action  \nplan.  \n Even if a perfect, direct measurement source is not im mediately feasible for a given \ngoal, the discussion about the desired end result (why this goal is important) and what \nthe measurement options are (what success might look like) is an important and \nvaluable part of performance planning.  \n Measurement methods  can be both quantitative  (productivity results , money saved or \nearned, etc .) and qualitative  (client testimonials, surveys, etc.) . \n  \nPerformance Appraisal Planning 2016 -2017    SMART Goals: A How to  Guide  \n \n \n6 \n  \n Some typical data types and data collection methods may include:  \n \nDATA TYPES  DATA COLLECTION METHODS  \nQuality/accuracy ra tes Automated reports  \nAmounts produced  Audits, tests  \nRevenue generated  Surveys  \nProductivity rates  Work products, samples  \nCustomer Satisfaction  Other documents  \n \nA – Achievable  \nThis focuses on how important a goal is to you and what you can do to make it attainable and \nmay require developing new skills and changing attitudes. The goal is meant to inspire \nmotivation, not discouragement. Think about : \n how to accomplish the goal , \n if you have the to ols/skills needed,  \n if not , consider what it would take to at tain them.  \nR – Relevant  \nRelevance refers focusing on something that makes sense with the broader business goals. For \nexample, if the goal is to launch a new program or service , it should be something that’s in \nalignment with the overall business /department  objectives. Your team may be able to launch a \nnew program, but if your division  is not prioritizing launching that type of new programs , then \nthe goal wouldn’t be relevant.   \nT – Time -Bound  \nAnyone can set goals, but if it lacks realistic timing, chances ar e you’re not going to succeed. \nProviding a target date for deliverables is imperative. Ask specific questions about the goal \ndeadline and what can be accomplished within that time period. If the goal will take three \nmonths to complete, it’s useful to defin e what should be achieved half -way through the \nprocess. Providing time constraints also creates a sense of urgency.  \nThe Easiest Way to Write S.M.A.R.T. Goals  \nWhen it comes to writing S.M.A.R.T. goals, ask yourself and other team members a lot of \nquestions. The answers will help fine -tune your strategy, ensuring the goals are something \nthat’s actually attainable. Utilize the template provided in the appendix as a guide.",

This makes a goal more \ntangible because it provides a way to measure progress. If it’s a project that’s goi ng to take a \nfew months to complete, then set some milestones by considering specific tasks to accomplish. \nMilestones are a series of steps along the way that when added up will result in the completion \nof your main goal.  \n As the “M” in SMART states, there should be a source of information to measure or \ndetermine whether a goal has been achieved.  \n The M is a direct (or possibly indirect) indicator of what success for a particular goal will \nlook like.  \n Sometimes measurement is dif ficult and managers  and employe es will need to work \ntogether to identify the most relevant and feasible data sources and collection methods.  \n Data collection efforts needed to measure a goal can be  included in that goal’s action  \nplan.  \n Even if a perfect, direct measurement source is not im mediately feasible for a given \ngoal, the discussion about the desired end result (why this goal is important) and what \nthe measurement options are (what success might look like) is an important and \nvaluable part of performance planning.  \n Measurement methods  can be both quantitative  (productivity results , money saved or \nearned, etc .) and qualitative  (client testimonials, surveys, etc.) . \n  \nPerformance Appraisal Planning 2016 -2017    SMART Goals: A How to  Guide  \n \n \n6 \n  \n Some typical data types and data collection methods may include:  \n \nDATA TYPES  DATA COLLECTION METHODS  \nQuality/accuracy ra tes Automated reports  \nAmounts produced  Audits, tests  \nRevenue generated  Surveys  \nProductivity rates  Work products, samples  \nCustomer Satisfaction  Other documents  \n \nA – Achievable  \nThis focuses on how important a goal is to you and what you can do to make it attainable and \nmay require developing new skills and changing attitudes.

    "text": " \nA – Achievable  \nThis focuses on how important a goal is to you and what you can do to make it attainable and \nmay require developing new skills and changing attitudes. The goal is meant to inspire \nmotivation, not discouragement. Think about : \n how to accomplish the goal , \n if you have the to ols/skills needed,  \n if not , consider what it would take to at tain them.  \nR – Relevant  \nRelevance refers focusing on something that makes sense with the broader business goals. For \nexample, if the goal is to launch a new program or service , it should be something that’s in \nalignment with the overall business /department  objectives. Your team may be able to launch a \nnew program, but if your division  is not prioritizing launching that type of new programs , then \nthe goal wouldn’t be relevant.   \nT – Time -Bound  \nAnyone can set goals, but if it lacks realistic timing, chances ar e you’re not going to succeed. \nProviding a target date for deliverables is imperative. Ask specific questions about the goal \ndeadline and what can be accomplished within that time period. If the goal will take three \nmonths to complete, it’s useful to defin e what should be achieved half -way through the \nprocess. Providing time constraints also creates a sense of urgency.  \nThe Easiest Way to Write S.M.A.R.T. Goals  \nWhen it comes to writing S.M.A.R.T. goals, ask yourself and other team members a lot of \nquestions. The answers will help fine -tune your strategy, ensuring the goals are something \nthat’s actually attainable. Utilize the template provided in the appendix as a guide.",
