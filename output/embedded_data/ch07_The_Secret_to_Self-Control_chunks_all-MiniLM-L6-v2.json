While visiting the troops,\nthey had learned that over 15 percent of U .S. soldiers\nstationed there were heroin addicts. Follow-up research\nrevealed that 35 percent of service members in V ietnam\nhad tried heroin and as many as 20 percent were addicted\n—the problem was even worse than they had initially\nthought.\nThe discovery led to a ﬂurry of activity in W ashington,\nincluding the creation of the Special Action Oﬀice of Drug\nAbuse Prevention under President Nixon to promote\nprevention and rehabilitation and to track addicted service\nmembers when they returned home.\nLee Robins was one of the researchers in charge. In a\nﬁnding that completely upended the accepted beliefs about\naddiction, Robins found that when soldiers who had been\nheroin users returned home, only 5 percent of them\nbecame re-addicted within a year , and just 12 percent\nrelapsed within three years. In other words, approximately\nnine out of ten soldiers who used heroin in V ietnam\neliminated their addiction nearly overnight.\nThis ﬁnding contradicted the prevailing view at the time,\nwhich considered heroin addiction to be a permanent and\nirreversible condition. Instead, Robins revealed that\naddictions could spontaneously dissolve if there was a\nradical change in the environment. In V ietnam, soldiers\nspent all day surrounded by cues triggering heroin use: it\nwas easy to access, they were engulfed by the constant\nstress of war , they built friendships with fellow soldiers\nwho were also heroin users, and they were thousands of\nmiles from home. Once a soldier returned to the United\nStates, though, he found himself in an environment devoid\nof those triggers. When the context changed, so did the\nhabit.\nCompare this situation to that of a typical drug user .\nSomeone becomes addicted at home or with friends, goes\nto a clinic to get clean—which is devoid of all the\nenvironmental stimuli that prompt their habit—then\nreturns to their old neighborhood with all of their previous\ncues that caused them to get addicted in the ﬁrst place. It’s\nno wonder that usually you see numbers that are the exact\nopposite of those in the V ietnam study . Typically , 90\npercent of heroin users become re-addicted once they\nreturn home from rehab.\nThe V ietnam studies ran counter to many of our cultural\nbeliefs about bad habits because it challenged the\nconventional association of unhealthy behavior as a moral\nweakness. If you’re overweight, a smoker , or an addict,\nyou’ve been told your entire life that it is because you lack\nself-control—maybe even that you’re a bad person. The idea\nthat a little bit of discipline would solve all our problems is\ndeeply embedded in our culture.\nRecent research, however , shows something diﬀerent.\nWhen scientists analyze people who appear to have\ntremendous self -control, it turns out those individuals\naren’t all that diﬀerent from those who are struggling.\nInstead, “ disciplined” people are better at structuring their\nlives in a way that does not require  heroic willpower and\nself-control. In other words, they spend less time in\ntempting situations.\nThe people with the best self -control are typically the\nones who need to use it the least. It’s easier to practice\nself-restraint when you don’t have to use it very often. So,\nyes, perseverance, grit, and willpower are essential to\nsuccess, but the way to improve these qualities is not by\nwishing you were a more disciplined person, but by\ncreating a more disciplined environment.\nThis counterintuitive idea makes even more sense once\nyou understand what happens when a habit is formed in\nthe brain. A habit that has been encoded in the mind is\nready to be used whenever the relevant situation arises.\nWhen P atty Olwell, a therapist from Austin, T exas, started\nsmoking, she would often light up while riding horses with\na friend. Eventually , she quit smoking and avoided it for\nyears. She had also stopped riding. Decades later , she\nhopped on a horse again and found herself craving a\ncigarette for the ﬁrst time in forever . The cues were still\ninternalized; she just hadn’t been exposed to them in a long\ntime.\nOnce a habit has been encoded, the urge to act follows\nwhenever the environmental cues reappear . This is one\nreason behavior change techniques can backﬁre.",

    "text": "I\n7\nThe Secr et to Self -Contr ol\nN 1971 , as the V ietnam W ar was heading into its sixteenth\nyear, congressmen Robert Steele from Connecticut and\nMorgan Murphy from Illinois made a discovery that\nstunned the American public. While visiting the troops,\nthey had learned that over 15 percent of U .S. soldiers\nstationed there were heroin addicts. Follow-up research\nrevealed that 35 percent of service members in V ietnam\nhad tried heroin and as many as 20 percent were addicted\n—the problem was even worse than they had initially\nthought.\nThe discovery led to a ﬂurry of activity in W ashington,\nincluding the creation of the Special Action Oﬀice of Drug\nAbuse Prevention under President Nixon to promote\nprevention and rehabilitation and to track addicted service\nmembers when they returned home.\nLee Robins was one of the researchers in charge. In a\nﬁnding that completely upended the accepted beliefs about\naddiction, Robins found that when soldiers who had been\nheroin users returned home, only 5 percent of them\nbecame re-addicted within a year , and just 12 percent\nrelapsed within three years. In other words, approximately\nnine out of ten soldiers who used heroin in V ietnam\neliminated their addiction nearly overnight.\nThis ﬁnding contradicted the prevailing view at the time,\nwhich considered heroin addiction to be a permanent and\nirreversible condition. Instead, Robins revealed that\naddictions could spontaneously dissolve if there was a\nradical change in the environment. In V ietnam, soldiers\nspent all day surrounded by cues triggering heroin use: it\nwas easy to access, they were engulfed by the constant\nstress of war , they built friendships with fellow soldiers\nwho were also heroin users, and they were thousands of\nmiles from home. Once a soldier returned to the United\nStates, though, he found himself in an environment devoid\nof those triggers. When the context changed, so did the\nhabit.\nCompare this situation to that of a typical drug user .\nSomeone becomes addicted at home or with friends, goes\nto a clinic to get clean—which is devoid of all the\nenvironmental stimuli that prompt their habit—then\nreturns to their old neighborhood with all of their previous\ncues that caused them to get addicted in the ﬁrst place.

    "text": " completely upended the accepted beliefs about\naddiction, Robins found that when soldiers who had been\nheroin users returned home, only 5 percent of them\nbecame re-addicted within a year , and just 12 percent\nrelapsed within three years. In other words, approximately\nnine out of ten soldiers who used heroin in V ietnam\neliminated their addiction nearly overnight.\nThis ﬁnding contradicted the prevailing view at the time,\nwhich considered heroin addiction to be a permanent and\nirreversible condition. Instead, Robins revealed that\naddictions could spontaneously dissolve if there was a\nradical change in the environment. In V ietnam, soldiers\nspent all day surrounded by cues triggering heroin use: it\nwas easy to access, they were engulfed by the constant\nstress of war , they built friendships with fellow soldiers\nwho were also heroin users, and they were thousands of\nmiles from home. Once a soldier returned to the United\nStates, though, he found himself in an environment devoid\nof those triggers. When the context changed, so did the\nhabit.\nCompare this situation to that of a typical drug user .\nSomeone becomes addicted at home or with friends, goes\nto a clinic",

    "text": " to get clean—which is devoid of all the\nenvironmental stimuli that prompt their habit—then\nreturns to their old neighborhood with all of their previous\ncues that caused them to get addicted in the ﬁrst place. It’s\nno wonder that usually you see numbers that are the exact\nopposite of those in the V ietnam study . Typically , 90\npercent of heroin users become re-addicted once they\nreturn home from rehab.\nThe V ietnam studies ran counter to many of our cultural\nbeliefs about bad habits because it challenged the\nconventional association of unhealthy behavior as a moral\nweakness. If you’re overweight, a smoker , or an addict,\nyou’ve been told your entire life that it is because you lack\nself-control—maybe even that you’re a bad person. The idea\nthat a little bit of discipline would solve all our problems is\ndeeply embedded in our culture.\nRecent research, however , shows something diﬀerent.\nWhen scientists analyze people who appear to have\ntremendous self -control, it turns out those individuals\naren’t all that diﬀerent from those who are struggling.\nInstead, “ disciplined” people are better at structuring their\nlives in a way that does not require  heroic willpower and\nself-control. In other words, they spend less time in\ntempting situations.\nThe people with the best self -control are typically the\nones who need to use it the least. It’s easier to practice\nself-restraint when you don’t have to use it very often. So,\nyes, perseverance, grit, and willpower are essential to\nsuccess, but the way to improve these qualities is not by\nwishing you were a more disciplined person, but by\ncreating a more disciplined environment.\nThis counterintuitive idea makes even more sense once\nyou understand what happens when a habit is formed in\nthe brain. A habit that has been encoded in the mind is\nready to be used whenever the relevant situation arises.\nWhen P atty Olwell, a therapist from Austin, T exas, started\nsmoking, she would often light up while riding horses with\na friend. Eventually , she quit smoking and avoided it for\nyears. She had also stopped riding. Decades later , she\nhopped on a horse again and found herself craving a\ncigarette for the ﬁrst time in forever . The cues were still\ninternalized",

It’s\nno wonder that usually you see numbers that are the exact\nopposite of those in the V ietnam study . Typically , 90\npercent of heroin users become re-addicted once they\nreturn home from rehab.\nThe V ietnam studies ran counter to many of our cultural\nbeliefs about bad habits because it challenged the\nconventional association of unhealthy behavior as a moral\nweakness. If you’re overweight, a smoker , or an addict,\nyou’ve been told your entire life that it is because you lack\nself-control—maybe even that you’re a bad person. The idea\nthat a little bit of discipline would solve all our problems is\ndeeply embedded in our culture.\nRecent research, however , shows something diﬀerent.\nWhen scientists analyze people who appear to have\ntremendous self -control, it turns out those individuals\naren’t all that diﬀerent from those who are struggling.\nInstead, “ disciplined” people are better at structuring",

    "text": "When scientists analyze people who appear to have\ntremendous self -control, it turns out those individuals\naren’t all that diﬀerent from those who are struggling.\nInstead, “ disciplined” people are better at structuring their\nlives in a way that does not require  heroic willpower and\nself-control. In other words, they spend less time in\ntempting situations.\nThe people with the best self -control are typically the\nones who need to use it the least. It’s easier to practice\nself-restraint when you don’t have to use it very often. So,\nyes, perseverance, grit, and willpower are essential to\nsuccess, but the way to improve these qualities is not by\nwishing you were a more disciplined person, but by\ncreating a more disciplined environment.\nThis counterintuitive idea makes even more sense once\nyou understand what happens when a habit is formed in\nthe brain. A habit that has been encoded in the mind is\nready to be used whenever the relevant situation arises.\nWhen P atty Olwell, a therapist from Austin, T exas, started\nsmoking, she would often light up while riding horses with\na friend. Eventually , she quit smoking",

    "text": "; she just hadn’t been exposed to them in a long\ntime.\nOnce a habit has been encoded, the urge to act follows\nwhenever the environmental cues reappear . This is one\nreason behavior change techniques can backﬁre. Shaming\nobese people with weight-loss presentations can make\nthem feel stressed, and as a result many people return to\ntheir favorite coping strategy: overeating. Showing pictures\nof blackened lungs to smokers leads to higher levels of\nanxiety , which drives many people to reach for a cigarette.\nIf you’re not careful about cues, you can cause the very\nbehavior you want to stop.\nBad habits are autocatalytic: the process feeds itself .\nThey foster the feelings they try to numb. Y ou feel bad, so\nyou eat junk food. Because you eat junk food, you feel bad.\nWatching television makes you feel sluggish, so you watch\nmore television because you don’t have the energy to do\nanything else. W orrying about your health makes you feel\nanxious, which causes you to smoke to ease your anxiety ,\nwhich makes your health even worse and soon you’re\nfeeling more anxious. It’s a downward spiral, a runaway\ntrain of bad habits.\nResearchers refer to this phenomenon as “cue-induced\nwanting”: an external trigger causes a compulsive craving\nto repeat a bad habit. Once you notice  something, you\nbegin to want  it. This process is happening all the time—\noften without us realizing it. Scientists have found that\nshowing addicts a picture of cocaine for just thirty-three\nmilliseconds stimulates the reward pathway in the brain\nand sparks desire. This speed is too fast for the brain to\nconsciously register—the addicts couldn’t even tell you\nwhat they had seen—but they craved the drug all the same.\nHere’s the punch line: Y ou can break a habit, but you’re\nunlikely to forget it. Once the mental grooves of habit have\nbeen carved into your brain, they are nearly impossible to\nremove entirely—even if they go unused for quite a while.\nAnd that means that simply resisting temptation is an\nineﬀective strategy . It is hard to maintain a Zen attitude in\na life ﬁlled with interruptions. It takes too much energy . In\nthe short-run, you can choose to overpower temptation. In\nthe long-run, we become a product of the environment that\nwe live in. T o put it bluntly , I have never seen someone\nconsistently stick to positive habits in a negative\nenvironment.\nA more reliable approach is to cut bad habits oﬀ at the\nsource. One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad\nhabit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it.\nIf you can’t seem to get any work done, leave your\nphone in another room for a few hours.\nIf you’re continually feeling like you’re not enough,\nstop following social media accounts that trigger\njealousy and envy .\nIf you’re wasting too much time watching television,\nmove the TV out of the bedroom.\nIf you’re spending too much money on electronics, quit\nreading reviews of the latest tech gear .\nIf you’re playing too many video games, unplug the\nconsole and put it in a closet after each use.\nThis practice is an inversion of the 1st Law of Behavior\nChange. R ather than make it obvious , you can make it\ninvisible . I’m often surprised by how eﬀective simple\nchanges like these can be. Remove a single cue and the\nentire habit often fades away .\nSelf-control is a short-term strategy , not a long-term one.\nYou may be able to resist temptation once or twice, but it’s\nunlikely you can muster the willpower to override your\ndesires every time. Instead of summoning a new dose of\nwillpower whenever you want to do the right thing, your\nenergy would be better spent optimizing your environment.\nThis is the secret to self -control. Make the cues of your\ngood habits obvious and the cues of your bad habits\ninvisible.\nChapter Summary\nThe inversion of the 1st Law of Behavior Change is\nmake it invisible .\nOnce a habit is formed, it is unlikely to be forgotten.\nPeople with high self -control tend to spend less time in\ntempting situations. It’s easier to avoid temptation than\nresist it.\nOne of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit\nis to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it.\nSelf-control is a short-term strategy , not a long-term\none.\nHOW TO CREA TE A GOOD HABIT\nThe 1st Law : Make It Obvious\n1.1: Fill out the Habits Scor ecard.

    "text": "; she just hadn’t been exposed to them in a long\ntime.\nOnce a habit has been encoded, the urge to act follows\nwhenever the environmental cues reappear . This is one\nreason behavior change techniques can backﬁre. Shaming\nobese people with weight-loss presentations can make\nthem feel stressed, and as a result many people return to\ntheir favorite coping strategy: overeating. Showing pictures\nof blackened lungs to smokers leads to higher levels of\nanxiety , which drives many people to reach for a cigarette.\nIf you’re not careful about cues, you can cause the very\nbehavior you want to stop.\nBad habits are autocatalytic: the process feeds itself .\nThey foster the feelings they try to numb. Y ou feel bad, so\nyou eat junk food. Because you eat junk food, you feel bad.\nWatching television makes you feel sluggish, so you watch\nmore television because you don’t have the energy to do\nanything else. W orrying about your health makes you feel\nanxious, which causes you to smoke to ease your anxiety ,\nwhich makes your health even worse and soon you’re\nfeeling more anxious. It’s a downward spiral, a runaway\ntrain of bad habits.\nResearchers refer to this phenomenon as “cue-induced\nwanting”: an external trigger causes a compulsive craving\nto repeat a bad habit. Once you notice  something, you\nbegin to want  it. This process is happening all the time—\noften without us realizing it. Scientists have found that\nshowing addicts a picture of cocaine for just thirty-three\nmilliseconds stimulates the reward pathway in the brain\nand sparks desire. This speed is too fast for the brain to\nconsciously register—the addicts couldn’t even tell you\nwhat they had seen—but they craved the drug all the same.\nHere’s the punch line: Y ou can break a habit, but you’re\nunlikely to forget it. Once the mental grooves of habit have\nbeen carved into your brain, they are nearly impossible to\nremove entirely—even if they go unused for quite a while.\nAnd that means that simply resisting temptation is an\nineﬀective strategy . It is hard to maintain a Zen attitude in\na life ﬁlled with interruptions. It takes too much energy . In\nthe short-run, you can choose to overpower temptation. In\nthe long-run, we become a product of the environment that\nwe live in. T o put it bluntly ,",

Because you eat junk food, you feel bad.\nWatching television makes you feel sluggish, so you watch\nmore television because you don’t have the energy to do\nanything else. W orrying about your health makes you feel\nanxious, which causes you to smoke to ease your anxiety ,\nwhich makes your health even worse and soon you’re\nfeeling more anxious.

    "text": " health makes you feel\nanxious, which causes you to smoke to ease your anxiety ,\nwhich makes your health even worse and soon you’re\nfeeling more anxious. It’s a downward spiral, a runaway\ntrain of bad habits.\nResearchers refer to this phenomenon as “cue-induced\nwanting”: an external trigger causes a compulsive craving\nto repeat a bad habit. Once you notice  something, you\nbegin to want  it. This process is happening all the time—\noften without us realizing it. Scientists have found that\nshowing addicts a picture of cocaine for just thirty-three\nmilliseconds stimulates the reward pathway in the brain\nand sparks desire. This speed is too fast for the brain to\nconsciously register—the addicts couldn’t even tell you\nwhat they had seen—but they craved the drug all the same.\nHere’s the punch line: Y ou can break a habit, but you’re\nunlikely to forget it. Once the mental grooves of habit have\nbeen carved into your brain, they are nearly impossible to\nremove entirely—even if they go unused for quite a while.\nAnd that means that simply resisting temptation is an\nineﬀective strategy . It is hard to maintain a Zen attitude in\na life ﬁ",

    "text": "lled with interruptions. It takes too much energy . In\nthe short-run, you can choose to overpower temptation. In\nthe long-run, we become a product of the environment that\nwe live in. T o put it bluntly , I have never seen someone\nconsistently stick to positive habits in a negative\nenvironment.\nA more reliable approach is to cut bad habits oﬀ at the\nsource. One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad\nhabit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it.\nIf you can’t seem to get any work done, leave your\nphone in another room for a few hours.\nIf you’re continually feeling like you’re not enough,\nstop following social media accounts that trigger\njealousy and envy .\nIf you’re wasting too much time watching television,\nmove the TV out of the bedroom.\nIf you’re spending too much money on electronics, quit\nreading reviews of the latest tech gear .\nIf you’re playing too many video games, unplug the\nconsole and put it in a closet after each use.\nThis practice is an inversion of the 1st Law of Behavior\nChange. R ather than make it obvious , you can make it\ninvisible . I’m often surprised by how eﬀective simple\nchanges like these can be. Remove a single cue and the\nentire habit often fades away .\nSelf-control is a short-term strategy , not a long-term one.\nYou may be able to resist temptation once or twice, but it’s\nunlikely you can muster the willpower to override your\ndesires every time. Instead of summoning a new dose of\nwillpower whenever you want to do the right thing, your\nenergy would be better spent optimizing your environment.\nThis is the secret to self -control. Make the cues of your\ngood habits obvious and the cues of your bad habits\ninvisible.\nChapter Summary\nThe inversion of the 1st Law of Behavior Change is\nmake it invisible .\nOnce a habit is formed, it is unlikely to be forgotten.\nPeople with high self -control tend to spend less time in\ntempting situations. It’s easier to avoid temptation than\nresist it.\nOne of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit\nis to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it.\nSelf-control is a short-term strategy , not a long-term\none.\nHOW TO CREA TE A GOOD HABIT\nThe 1st Law : Make It Obvious\n1.",
