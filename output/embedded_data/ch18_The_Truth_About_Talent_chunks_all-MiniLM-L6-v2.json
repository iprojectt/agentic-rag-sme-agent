Phelps has won more Olympic medals not only than\nany swimmer but also more than any Olympian in any\nsport.\nFewer people know the name Hicham El Guerrouj, but\nhe was a fantastic athlete in his own right. El Guerrouj is a\nMoroccan runner who holds two Olympic gold medals and\nis one of the greatest middle-distance runners of all time.\nFor many years, he held the world record in the mile,\n1,500-meter , and 2,000-meter races. A t the Olympic Games\nin Athens, Greece, in 2004, he won gold in the 1,500-meter\nand 5,000-meter races.\nThese two athletes are wildly diﬀerent in many ways.\n(For starters, one competed on land and the other in\nwater .) But most notably , they diﬀer signiﬁcantly in height.\nEl Guerrouj is ﬁve feet, nine inches tall. Phelps is six feet,\nfour inches tall. Despite this seven-inch diﬀerence in\nheight, the two men are identical in one respect: Michael\nPhelps and Hicham El Guerrouj wear the same length\ninseam on their pants.\nHow is this possible? Phelps has relatively short legs for\nhis height and a very long torso, the perfect build for\nswimming. El Guerrouj has incredibly long legs and a short\nupper body , an ideal frame for distance running.\nNow, imagine if these world-class athletes were to switch\nsports. Given his remarkable athleticism, could Michael\nPhelps become an Olympic-caliber distance runner with\nenough training? It’s unlikely . At peak ﬁtness, Phelps\nweighed 194 pounds, which is 40 percent heavier than El\nGuerrouj, who competed at an ultralight 138 pounds. T aller\nrunners are heavier runners, and every extra pound is a\ncurse when it comes to distance running. Against elite\ncompetition, Phelps would be doomed from the start.\nSimilarly , El Guerrouj might be one of the best runners in\nhistory , but it’s doubtful he would ever qualify for the\nOlympics as a swimmer . Since 1976, the average height of\nOlympic gold medalists in the men’s 1,500-meter run is ﬁve\nfeet, ten inches. In comparison, the average height of\nOlympic gold medalists in the men’s 100-meter freestyle\nswim is six feet, four inches. Swimmers tend to be tall and\nhave long backs and arms, which are ideal for pulling\nthrough the water . El Guerrouj would be at a severe\ndisadvantage before he ever touched the pool.\nThe secret to maximizing your odds of success is to\nchoose the right ﬁeld of competition. This is just as true\nwith habit change as it is with sports and business. Habits\nare easier to perform, and more satisfying to stick with,\nwhen they align with your natural inclinations and abilities.\nLike Michael Phelps in the pool or Hicham El Guerrouj on\nthe track, you want to play a game where the odds are in\nyour favor .\nEmbracing this strategy requires the acceptance of the\nsimple truth that people are born with diﬀerent abilities.\nSome people don’t like to discuss this fact. On the surface,\nyour genes seem to be ﬁxed, and it’s no fun to talk about\nthings you cannot control. Plus, phrases like biological\ndeterminism  makes it sound like certain individuals are\ndestined for success and others doomed to failure. But this\nis a shortsighted view of the inﬂuence of genes on behavior .\nThe strength of genetics is also their weakness. Genes\ncannot be easily changed, which means they provide a\npowerful advantage in favorable circumstances and a\nserious disadvantage in unfavorable circumstances. If you\nwant to dunk a basketball, being seven feet tall is very\nuseful. If you want to perform a gymnastics routine, being\nseven feet tall is a great hindrance. Our environment\ndetermines the suitability of our genes and the utility of our\nnatural talents. When our environment changes, so do the\nqualities that determine success.\nThis is true not just for physical characteristics but for\nmental ones as well. I’m smart if you ask me about habits\nand human behavior; not so much when it comes to\nknitting, rocket propulsion, or guitar chords. Competence\nis highly dependent on context.\nThe people at the top of any competitive �",

Phelps has won more Olympic medals not only than\nany swimmer but also more than any Olympian in any\nsport.\nFewer people know the name Hicham El Guerrouj, but\nhe was a fantastic athlete in his own right. El Guerrouj is a\nMoroccan runner who holds two Olympic gold medals and\nis one of the greatest middle-distance runners of all time.\nFor many years, he held the world record in the mile,\n1,500-meter , and 2,000-meter races. A t the Olympic Games\nin Athens, Greece, in 2004, he won gold in the 1,500-meter\nand 5,000-meter races.\nThese two athletes are wildly diﬀerent in many ways.\n(For starters, one competed on land and the other in\nwater .) But most notably , they diﬀer signiﬁcantly in height.\nEl Guerrouj is ﬁve feet, nine inches tall. Phelps is six feet,\nfour inches tall. Despite this seven-inch diﬀerence in\nheight, the two men are identical in one respect: Michael\nPhelps and Hicham El Guerrouj wear the same length\ninseam on their pants.\nHow is this possible? Phelps has relatively short legs for\nhis height and a very long torso, the perfect build for\nswimming. El Guerrouj has incredibly long legs and a short\nupper body , an ideal frame for distance running.\nNow, imagine if these world-class athletes were to switch\nsports. Given his remarkable athleticism, could Michael\nPhelps become an Olympic-caliber distance runner with\nenough training? It’s unlikely . At peak ﬁtness, Phelps\nweighed 194 pounds, which is 40 percent heavier than El\nGuerrouj, who competed at an ultralight 138 pounds. T aller\nrunners are heavier runners, and every extra pound is a\ncurse when it comes to distance running. Against elite\ncompetition, Phelps would be doomed from the start.\nSimilarly , El Guerrouj might be one of the best runners in\nhistory , but it’s doubtful he would ever qualify for the",

    "text": "curse when it comes to distance running. Against elite\ncompetition, Phelps would be doomed from the start.\nSimilarly , El Guerrouj might be one of the best runners in\nhistory , but it’s doubtful he would ever qualify for the\nOlympics as a swimmer . Since 1976, the average height of\nOlympic gold medalists in the men’s 1,500-meter run is ﬁve\nfeet, ten inches. In comparison, the average height of\nOlympic gold medalists in the men’s 100-meter freestyle\nswim is six feet, four inches. Swimmers tend to be tall and\nhave long backs and arms, which are ideal for pulling\nthrough the water . El Guerrouj would be at a severe\ndisadvantage before he ever touched the pool.\nThe secret to maximizing your odds of success is to\nchoose the right ﬁeld of competition. This is just as true\nwith habit change as it is with sports and business. Habits\nare easier to perform, and more satisfying to stick with,\nwhen they align with your natural inclinations and abilities.\nLike Michael Phelps in the pool or Hicham El Guerrouj on\nthe track, you want to play a game where the odds are in\nyour favor .\nEmbracing this strategy requires the acceptance of the\nsimple truth that people are born with diﬀerent abilities.\nSome people don’t like to discuss this fact. On the surface,\nyour genes seem to be ﬁxed, and it’s no fun to talk about\nthings you cannot control. Plus, phrases like biological\ndeterminism  makes it sound like certain individuals are\ndestined for success and others doomed to failure. But this\nis a shortsighted view of the inﬂuence of genes on behavior .\nThe strength of genetics is also their weakness. Genes\ncannot be easily changed, which means they provide a\npowerful advantage in favorable circumstances and a\nserious disadvantage in unfavorable circumstances. If you\nwant to dunk a basketball, being seven feet tall is very\nuseful. If you want to perform a gymnastics routine, being\nseven feet tall is a great hindrance. Our environment\ndetermines the suitability of our genes and the utility of our\nnatural talents. When our environment changes, so do the\nqualities that determine success.\nThis is true not just for physical characteristics but for\nmental ones as well.",

Against elite\ncompetition, Phelps would be doomed from the start.\nSimilarly , El Guerrouj might be one of the best runners in\nhistory , but it’s doubtful he would ever qualify for the\nOlympics as a swimmer . Since 1976, the average height of\nOlympic gold medalists in the men’s 1,500-meter run is ﬁve\nfeet, ten inches. In comparison, the average height of\nOlympic gold medalists in the men’s 100-meter freestyle\nswim is six feet, four inches. Swimmers tend to be tall and\nhave long backs and arms, which are ideal for pulling\nthrough the water . El Guerrouj would be at a severe\ndisadvantage before he ever touched the pool.\nThe secret to maximizing your odds of success is to\nchoose the right ﬁeld of competition. This is just as true\nwith habit change as it is with sports and business. Habits\nare easier to perform, and more satisfying to stick with,\nwhen they align with your natural inclinations and abilities.\nLike Michael Phelps in the pool or Hicham El Guerrouj on\nthe track",

    "text": " with sports and business. Habits\nare easier to perform, and more satisfying to stick with,\nwhen they align with your natural inclinations and abilities.\nLike Michael Phelps in the pool or Hicham El Guerrouj on\nthe track, you want to play a game where the odds are in\nyour favor .\nEmbracing this strategy requires the acceptance of the\nsimple truth that people are born with diﬀerent abilities.\nSome people don’t like to discuss this fact. On the surface,\nyour genes seem to be ﬁxed, and it’s no fun to talk about\nthings you cannot control. Plus, phrases like biological\ndeterminism  makes it sound like certain individuals are\ndestined for success and others doomed to failure. But this\nis a shortsighted view of the inﬂuence of genes on behavior .\nThe strength of genetics is also their weakness. Genes\ncannot be easily changed, which means they provide a\npowerful advantage in favorable circumstances and a\nserious disadvantage in unfavorable circumstances. If you\nwant to dunk a basketball, being seven feet tall is very\nuseful. If you want to perform a gymnastics routine, being\nseven feet tall is a great hindrance.",

    "text": " I’m smart if you ask me about habits\nand human behavior; not so much when it comes to\nknitting, rocket propulsion, or guitar chords. Competence\nis highly dependent on context.\nThe people at the top of any competitive ﬁeld are not\nonly well trained, they are also well suited to the task. And\nthis is why , if you want to be truly great, selecting the right\nplace to focus is crucial.\nIn short: genes do not determine your destiny . They\ndetermine your areas of opportunity . As physician Gabor\nMate notes, “ Genes can predispose, but they don’t\npredetermine.” The areas where you are genetically\npredisposed to success are the areas where habits are\nmore likely to be satisfying. The key is to direct your eﬀort\ntoward areas that both excite you and match your natural\nskills, to align your ambition with your ability .\nThe obvious question is, “How do I ﬁgure out where the\nodds are in my favor? How do I identify the opportunities\nand habits that are right for me?” The ﬁrst place we will\nlook for an answer is by understanding your personality .\nHOW Y OUR PERSONALITY INFL UENCES Y OUR HABITS\nYour genes are operating beneath the surface of every\nhabit. Indeed, beneath the surface of every behavior . Genes\nhave been shown to inﬂuence everything from the number\nof hours you spend watching television to your likelihood to\nmarry or divorce to your tendency to get addicted to drugs,\nalcohol, or nicotine. There’s a strong genetic component to\nhow obedient or rebellious you are when facing authority ,\nhow vulnerable or resistant you are to stressful events, how\nproactive or reactive you tend to be, and even how\ncaptivated or bored you feel during sensory experiences\nlike attending a concert. As Robert Plomin, a behavioral\ngeneticist at King’s College in London, told me, “It is now\nat the point where we have stopped testing to see if traits\nhave a genetic component because we literally can’t ﬁnd a\nsingle one that isn’t inﬂuenced by our genes.”\nBundled together , your unique cluster of genetic traits\npredispose you to a particular personality . Your personality\nis the set of characteristics that is consistent from situation\nto situation. The most proven scientiﬁc analysis of\npersonality traits is known as the “Big Five,” which breaks\nthem down into ﬁve spectrums of behavior .\n1. Openness to experience: from curious and inventive\non one end to cautious and consistent on the other .\n2. Conscientiousness: organized and eﬀicient to\neasygoing and spontaneous.\n3. Extroversion: outgoing and energetic to solitary and\nreserved (you likely know them as extroverts vs.\nintroverts).\n4. Agreeableness: friendly and compassionate to\nchallenging and detached.\n5. Neuroticism: anxious and sensitive to conﬁdent, calm,\nand stable.\nAll ﬁve characteristics have biological underpinnings.\nExtroversion, for instance, can be tracked from birth. If\nscientists play a loud noise in the nursing ward, some\nbabies turn toward it while others turn away . When the\nresearchers tracked these children through life, they found\nthat the babies who turned toward the noise were more\nlikely to grow up to be extroverts. Those who turned away\nwere more likely to become introverts.\nPeople who are high in agreeableness are kind,\nconsiderate, and warm. They also tend to have higher\nnatural oxytocin levels, a hormone that plays an important\nrole in social bonding, increases feelings of trust, and can\nact as a natural antidepressant. Y ou can easily imagine how\nsomeone with more oxytocin might be inclined to build\nhabits like writing thank -you notes or organizing social\nevents.\nAs a third example, consider neuroticism, which is a\npersonality trait all people possess to various degrees.\nPeople who are high in neuroticism tend to be anxious and\nworry more than others. This trait has been linked to\nhypersensitivity of the amygdala, the portion of the brain\nresponsible for noticing threats. In other words, people\nwho are more sensitive to negative cues in their\nenvironment are more likely to score high in neuroticism.\nOur habits are not solely determined by our\npersonalities, but there is no doubt that our genes nudge us\nin a certain direction. Our deeply rooted preferences make\ncertain behaviors easier for some people than for others.\nYou don’t have to apologize for these diﬀerences or feel\nguilty about them, but you do have to work with them.

Competence\nis highly dependent on context.\nThe people at the top of any competitive ﬁeld are not\nonly well trained, they are also well suited to the task. And\nthis is why , if you want to be truly great, selecting the right\nplace to focus is crucial.\nIn short: genes do not determine your destiny . They\ndetermine your areas of opportunity . As physician Gabor\nMate notes, “ Genes can predispose, but they don’t\npredetermine.” The areas where you are genetically\npredisposed to success are the areas where habits are\nmore likely to be satisfying. The key is to direct your eﬀort\ntoward areas that both excite you and match your natural\nskills, to align your ambition with your ability .\nThe obvious question is, “How do I ﬁgure out where the\nodds are in my favor? How do I identify the opportunities\nand habits that are right for me?” The ﬁrst place we will\nlook for an answer is by understanding your personality .\nHOW Y OUR PERSONALITY INFL UENCES Y OUR HABITS\nYour genes are operating beneath the surface of every\nhabit. Indeed, beneath the surface of every behavior . Genes\nhave been shown to inﬂuence everything from the number\nof hours you spend watching television to your likelihood to\nmarry or divorce to your tendency to get addicted to drugs,\nalcohol, or nicotine. There’s a strong genetic component to\nhow obedient or rebellious you are when facing authority ,\nhow vulnerable or resistant you are to stressful events, how\nproactive or reactive you tend to be, and even how\ncaptivated or bored you feel during sensory experiences\nlike attending a concert. As Robert Plomin, a behavioral\ngeneticist at King’s College in London, told me, “It is now\nat the point where we have stopped testing to see if traits\nhave a genetic component because we literally can’t ﬁnd a\nsingle one that isn’t inﬂuenced by our genes.”\nBundled together , your unique cluster of genetic traits\npredispose you to a particular personality . Your personality\nis the set of characteristics that is consistent from situation\nto situation. The most proven scientiﬁc analysis of\n",

    "text": "ure out where the\nodds are in my favor? How do I identify the opportunities\nand habits that are right for me?” The ﬁrst place we will\nlook for an answer is by understanding your personality .\nHOW Y OUR PERSONALITY INFL UENCES Y OUR HABITS\nYour genes are operating beneath the surface of every\nhabit. Indeed, beneath the surface of every behavior . Genes\nhave been shown to inﬂuence everything from the number\nof hours you spend watching television to your likelihood to\nmarry or divorce to your tendency to get addicted to drugs,\nalcohol, or nicotine. There’s a strong genetic component to\nhow obedient or rebellious you are when facing authority ,\nhow vulnerable or resistant you are to stressful events, how\nproactive or reactive you tend to be, and even how\ncaptivated or bored you feel during sensory experiences\nlike attending a concert. As Robert Plomin, a behavioral\ngeneticist at King’s College in London, told me, “It is now\nat the point where we have stopped testing to see if traits\nhave a genetic component because we literally can’t ﬁnd a\nsingle one that isn’t inﬂuenced by our genes",

The most proven scientiﬁc analysis of\npersonality traits is known as the “Big Five,” which breaks\nthem down into ﬁve spectrums of behavior .\n1. Openness to experience: from curious and inventive\non one end to cautious and consistent on the other .\n2. Conscientiousness: organized and eﬀicient to\neasygoing and spontaneous.\n3. Extroversion: outgoing and energetic to solitary and\nreserved (you likely know them as extroverts vs.\nintroverts).\n4. Agreeableness: friendly and compassionate to\nchallenging and detached.\n5. Neuroticism: anxious and sensitive to conﬁdent, calm,\nand stable.\nAll ﬁve characteristics have biological underpinnings.\nExtroversion, for instance, can be tracked from birth. If\nscientists play a loud noise in the nursing ward, some\nbabies turn toward it while others turn away . When the\nresearchers tracked these children through life, they found\nthat the babies who turned toward the noise were more\nlikely to grow up to be extroverts. Those who turned away\nwere more likely to become introverts.\nPeople who are high in agreeableness are kind,\nconsiderate, and warm. They also tend to have higher\nnatural oxytocin levels, a hormone that plays an important\nrole in social bonding, increases feelings of trust, and can\nact as a natural antidepressant. Y ou can easily imagine how\nsomeone with more oxytocin might be inclined to build\nhabits like writing thank -you notes or organizing social\nevents.\nAs a third example, consider neuroticism, which is a\npersonality trait all people possess to various degrees.\nPeople who are high in neuroticism tend to be anxious and\nworry more than others. This trait has been linked to\nhypersensitivity of the amygdala, the portion of the brain\nresponsible for noticing threats. In other words, people\nwho are more sensitive to negative cues in their\nenvironment are more likely to score high in neuroticism.\nOur habits are not solely determined by our\npersonalities, but there is no doubt that our genes nudge us\nin a certain direction. Our deeply rooted preferences make\ncertain behaviors easier",

    "text": " tracked from birth. If\nscientists play a loud noise in the nursing ward, some\nbabies turn toward it while others turn away . When the\nresearchers tracked these children through life, they found\nthat the babies who turned toward the noise were more\nlikely to grow up to be extroverts. Those who turned away\nwere more likely to become introverts.\nPeople who are high in agreeableness are kind,\nconsiderate, and warm. They also tend to have higher\nnatural oxytocin levels, a hormone that plays an important\nrole in social bonding, increases feelings of trust, and can\nact as a natural antidepressant. Y ou can easily imagine how\nsomeone with more oxytocin might be inclined to build\nhabits like writing thank -you notes or organizing social\nevents.\nAs a third example, consider neuroticism, which is a\npersonality trait all people possess to various degrees.\nPeople who are high in neuroticism tend to be anxious and\nworry more than others. This trait has been linked to\nhypersensitivity of the amygdala, the portion of the brain\nresponsible for noticing threats. In other words, people\nwho are more sensitive to negative cues in their\nenvironment",

    "text": " for some people than for others.\nYou don’t have to apologize for these diﬀerences or feel\nguilty about them, but you do have to work with them. A\nperson who scores lower on conscientiousness, for\nexample, will be less likely to be orderly by nature and may\nneed to rely more heavily on environment design to stick\nwith good habits. (As a reminder for the less conscientious\nreaders among us, environment design is a strategy we\ndiscussed in Chapters 6 and 12.)\nThe takeaway is that you should build habits that work\nfor your personality .* People can get ripped working out\nlike a bodybuilder , but if you prefer rock climbing or\ncycling or rowing, then shape your exercise habit around\nyour interests. If your friend follows a low-carb diet but you\nﬁnd that low-fat works for you, then more power to you. If\nyou want to read more, don’t be embarrassed if you prefer\nsteamy romance novels over nonﬁction. Read whatever\nfascinates you. * You don’t have to build the habits everyone\ntells you to build. Choose the habit that best suits you, not\nthe one that is most popular .\nThere is a version of every habit that can bring you joy\nand satisfaction. Find it. Habits need to be enjoyable if they\nare going to stick. This is the core idea behind the 4th Law .\nTailoring your habits to your personality is a good start,\nbut this is not the end of the story . Let’s turn our attention\nto ﬁnding and designing situations where you’re at a\nnatural advantage.\nHOW TO FIND A GAME WHERE THE ODDS ARE IN\nYOUR F AVOR\nLearning to play a game where the odds are in your favor is\ncritical for maintaining motivation and feeling successful.\nIn theory , you can enjoy almost anything. In practice, you\nare more likely to enjoy the things that come easily to you.\nPeople who are talented in a particular area tend to be\nmore competent at that task and are then praised for doing\na good job. They stay energized because they are making\nprogress where others have failed, and because they get\nrewarded with better pay and bigger opportunities, which\nnot only makes them happier but also propels them to\nproduce even higher-quality work. It’s a virtuous cycle.\nPick the right habit and progress is easy . Pick the wrong\nhabit and life is a struggle.\nHow do you pick the right habit? The ﬁrst step is\nsomething we covered in the 3rd Law: make it easy . In\nmany cases, when people pick the wrong habit, it simply\nmeans they picked a habit that was too diﬀicult. When a\nhabit is easy , you are more likely to be successful. When\nyou are successful, you are more likely to feel satisﬁed.\nHowever , there is another level to consider . In the long-run,\nif you continue to advance and improve, any area can\nbecome challenging. A t some point, you need to make sure\nyou’re playing the right game for your skillset. How do you\nﬁgure that out?\nThe most common approach is trial and error . Of course,\nthere’s a problem with this strategy: life is short. Y ou don’t\nhave time to try every career , date every eligible bachelor ,\nor play every musical instrument. Thankfully , there is an\neﬀective way to manage this conundrum, and it is known as\nthe explore/exploit trade-oﬀ .\nIn the beginning of a new activity , there should be a\nperiod of exploration. In relationships, it’s called dating. In\ncollege, it’s called the liberal arts. In business, it’s called\nsplit testing. The goal is to try out many possibilities,\nresearch a broad range of ideas, and cast a wide net.\nAfter this initial period of exploration, shift your focus to\nthe best solution you’ve found—but keep experimenting\noccasionally . The proper balance depends on whether\nyou’re winning or losing. If you are currently winning, you\nexploit, exploit, exploit. If you are currently losing, you\ncontinue to explore, explore, explore.\nIn the long-run it is probably most eﬀective to work on\nthe strategy that seems to deliver the best results about 80\nto 90 percent of the time and keep exploring with the\nremaining 10 to 20 percent. Google famously asks\nemployees to spend 80 percent of the workweek on their\noﬀicial job and 20 percent on projects of their choice,\nwhich has led to the creation of blockbuster products like\nAdWords and Gmail.\nThe optimal approach also depends on how much time\nyou have. If you have a lot of time—like someone at the\nbeginning of their career",

    "text": " for some people than for others.\nYou don’t have to apologize for these diﬀerences or feel\nguilty about them, but you do have to work with them. A\nperson who scores lower on conscientiousness, for\nexample, will be less likely to be orderly by nature and may\nneed to rely more heavily on environment design to stick\nwith good habits. (As a reminder for the less conscientious\nreaders among us, environment design is a strategy we\ndiscussed in Chapters 6 and 12.)\nThe takeaway is that you should build habits that work\nfor your personality .* People can get ripped working out\nlike a bodybuilder , but if you prefer rock climbing or\ncycling or rowing, then shape your exercise habit around\nyour interests. If your friend follows a low-carb diet but you\nﬁnd that low-fat works for you, then more power to you. If\nyou want to read more, don’t be embarrassed if you prefer\nsteamy romance novels over nonﬁction. Read whatever\nfascinates you. * You don’t have to build the habits everyone\ntells you to build. Choose the habit that best suits you, not\nthe one that is most popular .\nThere is a version of every habit that can bring you joy\nand satisfaction. Find it. Habits need to be enjoyable if they\nare going to stick. This is the core idea behind the 4th Law .\nTailoring your habits to your personality is a good start,\nbut this is not the end of the story . Let’s turn our attention\nto ﬁnding and designing situations where you’re at a\nnatural advantage.\nHOW TO FIND A GAME WHERE THE ODDS ARE IN\nYOUR F AVOR\nLearning to play a game where the odds are in your favor is\ncritical for maintaining motivation and feeling successful.\nIn theory , you can enjoy almost anything. In practice, you\nare more likely to enjoy the things that come easily to you.\nPeople who are talented in a particular area tend to be\nmore competent at that task and are then praised for doing\na good job. They stay energized because they are making\nprogress where others have failed, and because they get\nrewarded with better pay and bigger opportunities, which\nnot only makes them happier but also propels them to\nproduce even higher-quality work. It’s a virtuous cycle.\nPick the right habit and progress is easy . Pick the wrong",

A\nperson who scores lower on conscientiousness, for\nexample, will be less likely to be orderly by nature and may\nneed to rely more heavily on environment design to stick\nwith good habits. (As a reminder for the less conscientious\nreaders among us, environment design is a strategy we\ndiscussed in Chapters 6 and 12.)\nThe takeaway is that you should build habits that work\nfor your personality .* People can get ripped working out\nlike a bodybuilder , but if you prefer rock climbing or\ncycling or rowing, then shape your exercise habit around\nyour interests. If your friend follows a low-carb diet but you\nﬁnd that low-fat works for you, then more power to you. If\nyou want to read more, don’t be embarrassed if you prefer\nsteamy romance novels over nonﬁction. Read whatever\nfascinates you. * You don’t have to build the habits everyone\ntells you to build. Choose the habit that best suits you, not\nthe one that",

It’s a virtuous cycle.\nPick the right habit and progress is easy . Pick the wrong\nhabit and life is a struggle.\nHow do you pick the right habit? The ﬁrst step is\nsomething we covered in the 3rd Law: make it easy . In\nmany cases, when people pick the wrong habit, it simply\nmeans they picked a habit that was too diﬀicult. When a\nhabit is easy , you are more likely to be successful. When\nyou are successful, you are more likely to feel satisﬁed.\nHowever , there is another level to consider . In the long-run,\nif you continue to advance and improve, any area can\nbecome challenging. A t some point, you need to make sure\nyou’re playing the right game for your skillset. How do you\nﬁgure that out?\nThe most common approach is trial and error . Of course,\nthere’s a problem with this strategy: life is short. Y ou don’t\nhave time to try every career , date every eligible bachelor ,\nor play every musical instrument. Thankfully , there is an\neﬀective way to manage this conundrum, and it is known as\nthe explore/exploit trade-oﬀ .\nIn the beginning of a new activity , there should be a\nperiod of exploration. In relationships, it’s called dating. In\ncollege, it’s called the liberal arts. In business, it’s called\nsplit testing. The goal is to try out many possibilities,\nresearch a broad range of ideas, and cast a wide net.\nAfter this initial period of exploration, shift your focus to\nthe best solution you’ve found—but keep experimenting\noccasionally . The proper balance depends on whether\nyou’re winning or losing. If you are currently winning, you\nexploit, exploit, exploit. If you are currently losing, you\ncontinue to explore, explore, explore.\nIn the long-run it is probably most eﬀective to work on\nthe strategy that seems to deliver the best results about 80\nto 90 percent of the time and keep exploring with the\nremaining 10 to 20 percent.

    "text": " their choice,\nwhich has led to the creation of blockbuster products like\nAdWords and Gmail.\nThe optimal approach also depends on how much time\nyou have. If you have a lot of time—like someone at the\nbeginning of their career—it makes more sense to explore\nbecause once you ﬁnd the right thing, you still have a good\namount of time to exploit it. If you’re pressed for time—say ,\nas you come up on the deadline for a project—you should\nimplement the best solution you’ve found so far and get\nsome results.\nAs you explore diﬀerent options, there are a series of\nquestions you can ask yourself to continually narrow in on\nthe habits and areas that will be most satisfying to you:\nWhat feels like fun to me, but work to others? The\nmark of whether you are made for a task is not\nwhether you love it but whether you can handle the\npain of the task easier than most people. When are you\nenjoying yourself while other people are complaining?\nThe work that hurts you less than it hurts others is the\nwork you were made to do .\nWhat makes me lose track of time? Flow is the\nmental state you enter when you are so focused on the\ntask at hand that the rest of the world fades away . This\nblend of happiness and peak performance is what\nathletes and performers experience when they are “in\nthe zone.” It is nearly impossible to experience a ﬂow\nstate and not ﬁnd the task satisfying at least to some\ndegree.\nWhere do I get greater returns than the average\nperson?  We are continually comparing ourselves to\nthose around us, and a behavior is more likely to be\nsatisfying when the comparison is in our favor . When I\nstarted writing at jamesclear .com, my email list grew\nvery quickly . I wasn’t quite sure what I was doing well,\nbut I knew that results seemed to be coming faster for\nme than for some of my colleagues, which motivated\nme to keep writing.\nWhat comes naturally to me? For just a moment,\nignore what you have been taught. Ignore what society\nhas told you. Ignore what others expect of you. Look\ninside yourself and ask, “ What feels natural to me?\nWhen have I felt alive? When have I felt like the real\nme?” No internal judgments or people-pleasing. No\nsecond-guessing or self -criticism. Just feelings of\nengagement and enjoyment. Whenever you feel\nauthentic and genuine, you are headed in the right\ndirection.\nTo be honest, some of this process is just luck. Michael\nPhelps and Hicham El Guerrouj were lucky to be born with\na rare set of abilities that are highly valued by society and\nto be placed in the ideal environment for those abilities. W e\nall have limited time on this planet, and the truly great\namong us are the ones who not only work hard but also\nhave the good fortune to be exposed to opportunities that\nfavor us.\nBut what if you don’t want to leave it up to luck?\nIf you can’t ﬁnd a game where the odds are stacked in\nyour favor , create one. Scott Adams, the cartoonist behind\nDilbert , says, “ Everyone has at least a few areas in which\nthey could be in the top 25% with some eﬀort. In my case, I\ncan draw better than most people, but I’m hardly an artist.\nAnd I’m not any funnier than the average standup\ncomedian who never makes it big, but I’m funnier than\nmost people. The magic is that few people can draw well\nand write jokes. It’s the combination of the two that makes\nwhat I do so rare. And when you add in my business\nbackground, suddenly I had a topic that few cartoonists\ncould hope to understand without living it.”\nWhen you can’t win by being better , you can win by\nbeing diﬀerent. By combining your skills, you reduce the\nlevel of competition, which makes it easier to stand out.\nYou can shortcut the need for a genetic advantage (or for\nyears of practice) by rewriting the rules. A good player\nworks hard to win the game everyone else is playing. A\ngreat player creates a new game that favors their strengths\nand avoids their weaknesses.\nIn college, I designed my own major , biomechanics,\nwhich was a combination of physics, chemistry , biology , and\nanatomy . I wasn’t smart enough to stand out among the top\nphysics or biology majors, so I created my own game. And\nbecause it suited me—I was only taking the courses I was\ninterested in—studying felt like less of a chore. It was also\neasier to avoid the trap of comparing myself to everyone\nelse. A fter",

    "text": " their choice,\nwhich has led to the creation of blockbuster products like\nAdWords and Gmail.\nThe optimal approach also depends on how much time\nyou have. If you have a lot of time—like someone at the\nbeginning of their career—it makes more sense to explore\nbecause once you ﬁnd the right thing, you still have a good\namount of time to exploit it. If you’re pressed for time—say ,\nas you come up on the deadline for a project—you should\nimplement the best solution you’ve found so far and get\nsome results.\nAs you explore diﬀerent options, there are a series of\nquestions you can ask yourself to continually narrow in on\nthe habits and areas that will be most satisfying to you:\nWhat feels like fun to me, but work to others? The\nmark of whether you are made for a task is not\nwhether you love it but whether you can handle the\npain of the task easier than most people. When are you\nenjoying yourself while other people are complaining?\nThe work that hurts you less than it hurts others is the\nwork you were made to do .\nWhat makes me lose track of time? Flow is the\nmental state you enter when you are so focused on the\ntask at hand that the rest of the world fades away . This\nblend of happiness and peak performance is what\nathletes and performers experience when they are “in\nthe zone.” It is nearly impossible to experience a ﬂow\nstate and not ﬁnd the task satisfying at least to some\ndegree.\nWhere do I get greater returns than the average\nperson?  We are continually comparing ourselves to\nthose around us, and a behavior is more likely to be\nsatisfying when the comparison is in our favor . When I\nstarted writing at jamesclear .com, my email list grew\nvery quickly . I wasn’t quite sure what I was doing well,\nbut I knew that results seemed to be coming faster for\nme than for some of my colleagues, which motivated\nme to keep writing.\nWhat comes naturally to me? For just a moment,\nignore what you have been taught. Ignore what society\nhas told you. Ignore what others expect of you. Look\ninside yourself and ask, “ What feels natural to me?\nWhen have I felt alive? When have I felt like the real\nme?” No internal judgments or people-pleasing. No\nsecond-guessing or self -criticism.",

    "text": "\ninside yourself and ask, “ What feels natural to me?\nWhen have I felt alive? When have I felt like the real\nme?” No internal judgments or people-pleasing. No\nsecond-guessing or self -criticism. Just feelings of\nengagement and enjoyment. Whenever you feel\nauthentic and genuine, you are headed in the right\ndirection.\nTo be honest, some of this process is just luck. Michael\nPhelps and Hicham El Guerrouj were lucky to be born with\na rare set of abilities that are highly valued by society and\nto be placed in the ideal environment for those abilities. W e\nall have limited time on this planet, and the truly great\namong us are the ones who not only work hard but also\nhave the good fortune to be exposed to opportunities that\nfavor us.\nBut what if you don’t want to leave it up to luck?\nIf you can’t ﬁnd a game where the odds are stacked in\nyour favor , create one. Scott Adams, the cartoonist behind\nDilbert , says, “ Everyone has at least a few areas in which\nthey could be in the top 25% with some eﬀort. In my case, I\ncan draw better than most people, but I’m hardly an artist.\nAnd I’m not any funnier than the average standup\ncomedian who never makes it big, but I’m funnier than\nmost people. The magic is that few people can draw well\nand write jokes. It’s the combination of the two that makes\nwhat I do so rare. And when you add in my business\nbackground, suddenly I had a topic that few cartoonists\ncould hope to understand without living it.”\nWhen you can’t win by being better , you can win by\nbeing diﬀerent. By combining your skills, you reduce the\nlevel of competition, which makes it easier to stand out.\nYou can shortcut the need for a genetic advantage (or for\nyears of practice) by rewriting the rules. A good player\nworks hard to win the game everyone else is playing. A\ngreat player creates a new game that favors their strengths\nand avoids their weaknesses.\nIn college, I designed my own major , biomechanics,\nwhich was a combination of physics, chemistry , biology , and\nanatomy . I wasn’t smart enough to stand out among the top\nphysics or biology majors, so I created my own",

    "text": "your favor , create one. Scott Adams, the cartoonist behind\nDilbert , says, “ Everyone has at least a few areas in which\nthey could be in the top 25% with some eﬀort. In my case, I\ncan draw better than most people, but I’m hardly an artist.\nAnd I’m not any funnier than the average standup\ncomedian who never makes it big, but I’m funnier than\nmost people. The magic is that few people can draw well\nand write jokes. It’s the combination of the two that makes\nwhat I do so rare. And when you add in my business\nbackground, suddenly I had a topic that few cartoonists\ncould hope to understand without living it.”\nWhen you can’t win by being better , you can win by\nbeing diﬀerent. By combining your skills, you reduce the\nlevel of competition, which makes it easier to stand out.\nYou can shortcut the need for a genetic advantage (or for\nyears of practice) by rewriting the rules. A good player\nworks hard to win the game everyone else is playing. A\ngreat player creates a new game that favors their strengths\nand avoids their weaknesses.\nIn",

    "text": " game. And\nbecause it suited me—I was only taking the courses I was\ninterested in—studying felt like less of a chore. It was also\neasier to avoid the trap of comparing myself to everyone\nelse. A fter all, nobody else was taking the same\ncombination of classes, so who could say if they were better\nor worse?\nSpecialization is a powerful way to overcome the\n“accident” of bad genetics. The more you master a speciﬁc\nskill, the harder it becomes for others to compete with you.\nMany bodybuilders are stronger than the average arm\nwrestler , but even a massive bodybuilder may lose at arm\nwrestling because the arm wrestling champ has very\nspeciﬁc strength. Even if you’re not the most naturally\ngifted, you can often win by being the best in a very narrow\ncategory .\nBoiling water will soften a potato but harden an egg. Y ou\ncan’t control whether you’re a potato or an egg, but you\ncan decide to play a game where it’s better to be hard or\nsoft. If you can ﬁnd a more favorable environment, you can\ntransform the situation from one where the odds are\nagainst you to one where they are in your favor .\nHOW TO GET THE MOST OUT OF Y OUR GENES\nOur genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They\nclarify it. They tell us what  to work hard on. Once we\nrealize our strengths, we know where to spend our time\nand energy . We know which types of opportunities to look\nfor and which types of challenges to avoid. The better we\nunderstand our nature, the better our strategy can be.\nBiological diﬀerences matter . Even so, it’s more\nproductive to focus on whether you are fulﬁlling your own\npotential than comparing yourself to someone else. The fact\nthat you have a natural limit to any speciﬁc ability has\nnothing to do with whether you are reaching the ceiling of\nyour capabilities. P eople get so caught up in the fact that\nthey have  limits that they rarely exert the eﬀort required to\nget close to them.\nFurthermore, genes can’t make you successful if you’re\nnot doing the work. Y es, it’s possible that the ripped trainer\nat the gym has better genes, but if you haven’t put in the\nsame reps, it’s impossible to say if you have been dealt a\nbetter or worse genetic hand. Until you work as hard as\nthose you admire, don’t explain away their success as luck.\nIn summary , one of the best ways to ensure your habits\nremain satisfying over the long-run is to pick behaviors that\nalign with your personality and skills. W ork hard on the\nthings that come easy .\nChapter Summary\nThe secret to maximizing your odds of success is to\nchoose the right ﬁeld of competition.\nPick the right habit and progress is easy . Pick the\nwrong habit and life is a struggle.\nGenes cannot be easily changed, which means they\nprovide a powerful advantage in favorable\ncircumstances and a serious disadvantage in\nunfavorable circumstances.\nHabits are easier when they align with your natural\nabilities. Choose the habits that best suit you.\nPlay a game that favors your strengths. If you can’t ﬁnd\na game that favors you, create one.\nGenes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They\nclarify it. They tell us what  to work hard on.",

It was also\neasier to avoid the trap of comparing myself to everyone\nelse. A fter all, nobody else was taking the same\ncombination of classes, so who could say if they were better\nor worse?\nSpecialization is a powerful way to overcome the\n“accident” of bad genetics. The more you master a speciﬁc\nskill, the harder it becomes for others to compete with you.\nMany bodybuilders are stronger than the average arm\nwrestler , but even a massive bodybuilder may lose at arm\nwrestling because the arm wrestling champ has very\nspeciﬁc strength. Even if you’re not the most naturally\ngifted, you can often win by being the best in a very narrow\ncategory .\nBoiling water will soften a potato but harden an egg. Y ou\ncan’t control whether you’re a potato or an egg, but you\ncan decide to play a game where it’s better to be hard or\nsoft. If you can ﬁnd a more favorable environment, you can\ntransform the situation from one where the odds are\nagainst you to one where they are in your favor .\nHOW TO GET THE MOST OUT OF Y OUR GENES\nOur genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They\nclarify it. They tell us what  to work hard on. Once we\nrealize our strengths, we know where to spend our time\nand energy . We know which types of opportunities to look\nfor and which types of challenges to avoid. The better we\nunderstand our nature, the better our strategy can be.\nBiological diﬀerences matter . Even so, it’s more\nproductive to focus on whether you are fulﬁlling your own\npotential than comparing yourself to someone else. The fact\nthat you have a natural limit to any speciﬁc ability has\nnothing to do with whether you are reaching the ceiling of\nyour capabilities. P eople get so caught up in the fact that\nthey have  limits that they rarely exert the eﬀort required to\nget close to them.\nFurthermore, genes can’t make you successful if you’re\nnot doing the work.

Y es, it’s possible that the ripped trainer\nat the gym has better genes, but if you haven’t put in the\nsame reps, it’s impossible to say if you have been dealt a\nbetter or worse genetic hand. Until you work as hard as\nthose you admire, don’t explain away their success as luck.\nIn summary , one of the best ways to ensure your habits\nremain satisfying over the long-run is to pick behaviors that\nalign with your personality and skills.

Pick the\nwrong habit and life is a struggle.\nGenes cannot be easily changed, which means they\nprovide a powerful advantage in favorable\ncircumstances and a serious disadvantage in\nunfavorable circumstances.\nHabits are easier when they align with your natural\nabilities. Choose the habits that best suit you.\nPlay a game that favors your strengths. If you can’t ﬁnd\na game that favors you, create one.\nGenes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They\nclarify it. They tell us what  to work hard on.",
