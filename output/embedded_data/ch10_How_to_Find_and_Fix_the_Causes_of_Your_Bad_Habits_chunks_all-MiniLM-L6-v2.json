I was in the middle of a four-day trip to Turkey\nand my guide, Mike, was relaxing in a worn-out armchair a\nfew feet away .\nMike wasn’t really a guide. He was just a guy from\nMaine who had been living in Turkey for ﬁve years, but he\noﬀered to show me around while I was visiting the country\nand I took him up on it. On this particular night, I had been\ninvited to dinner with him and a handful of his Turkish\nfriends.\nThere were seven of us, and I was the only one who\nhadn’t, at some point, smoked at least one pack of\ncigarettes per day . I asked one of the Turks how he got\nstarted. “Friends,” he said. “It always starts with your\nfriends. One friend smokes, then you try it.”\nWhat was truly fascinating was that half of the people in\nthe room had managed to quit smoking. Mike had been\nsmoke-free for a few years at that point, and he swore up\nand down that he broke the habit because of a book called\nAllen Carr’s Easy W ay to Stop Smoking .\n“It frees you from the mental burden of smoking,” he\nsaid. “It tells you: ‘Stop lying to yourself . You know you\ndon’t actually want to smoke. Y ou know you don’t really\nenjoy this.’ It helps you feel like you’re not the victim\nanymore. Y ou start to realize that you don’t need  to\nsmoke.”\nI had never tried a cigarette, but I took a look at the\nbook afterward out of curiosity . The author employs an\ninteresting strategy to help smokers eliminate their\ncravings. He systematically reframes each cue associated\nwith smoking and gives it a new meaning.\nHe says things like:\nYou think you are quitting something, but you’re not\nquitting anything because cigarettes do nothing for\nyou.\nYou think smoking is something you need to do to be\nsocial, but it’s not. Y ou can be social without smoking\nat all.\nYou think smoking is about relieving stress, but it’s not.\nSmoking does not relieve your nerves, it destroys them.\nOver and over , he repeats these phrases and others like\nthem. “Get it clearly into your mind,” he says. “ You are\nlosing nothing and you are making marvelous positive gains\nnot only in health, energy and money but also in\nconﬁdence, self -respect, freedom and, most important of\nall, in the length and quality of your future life.”\nBy the time you get to the end of the book, smoking\nseems like the most ridiculous thing in the world to do . And\nif you no longer expect smoking to bring you any beneﬁts,\nyou have no reason to smoke. It is an inversion of the 2nd\nLaw of Behavior Change: make it unattractive .\nNow, I know this idea might sound overly simplistic. Just\nchange your mind and you can quit smoking. But stick with\nme for a minute.\nWHERE CRA VINGS COME FROM\nEvery behavior has a surface level craving and a deeper ,\nunderlying motive. I often have a craving that goes\nsomething like this: “I want to eat tacos.” If you were to ask\nme why I want to eat tacos, I wouldn’t say , “Because I need\nfood to survive.” But the truth is, somewhere deep down, I\nam motivated to eat tacos because I have to eat to survive.\nThe underlying motive is to obtain food and water even if\nmy speciﬁc craving is for a taco .\nSome of our underlying motives include: *\nConserve energy\nObtain food and water\nFind love and reproduce\nConnect and bond with others\nWin social acceptance and approval\nReduce uncertainty\nAchieve status and prestige\nA craving is just a speciﬁc manifestation of a deeper\nunderlying motive. Y our brain did not evolve with a desire\nto smoke cigarettes or to check Instagram or to play video\ngames. A t a deep level, you simply want to reduce\nuncertainty and relieve anxiety , to win social acceptance\nand approval, or to achieve status.\nLook at nearly any product that is habit-forming and\nyou’ll see that it does not create a new motivation, but\nrather latches onto the underlying motives of human\nnature.\nFind love and reproduce = using Tinder\nConnect and bond with others = browsing F acebook\nWin social acceptance and approval = posting on\nInstagram\nReduce uncertainty = searching on Google\nAchieve status and prestige = playing video games\nYour",

    "text": "I\n10\nHow to F ind and F ix the Causes of Y our Bad Habits\nN LATE 2012, I was sitting in an old apartment just a few\nblocks from Istanbul’s most famous street, Istiklal\nCaddesi. I was in the middle of a four-day trip to Turkey\nand my guide, Mike, was relaxing in a worn-out armchair a\nfew feet away .\nMike wasn’t really a guide. He was just a guy from\nMaine who had been living in Turkey for ﬁve years, but he\noﬀered to show me around while I was visiting the country\nand I took him up on it. On this particular night, I had been\ninvited to dinner with him and a handful of his Turkish\nfriends.\nThere were seven of us, and I was the only one who\nhadn’t, at some point, smoked at least one pack of\ncigarettes per day . I asked one of the Turks how he got\nstarted. “Friends,” he said. “It always starts with your\nfriends. One friend smokes, then you try it.”\nWhat was truly fascinating was that half of the people in\nthe room had managed to quit smoking. Mike had been\nsmoke-free for a few years at that point, and he swore up\nand down that he broke the habit because of a book called\nAllen Carr’s Easy W ay to Stop Smoking .\n“It frees you from the mental burden of smoking,” he\nsaid. “It tells you: ‘Stop lying to yourself . You know you\ndon’t actually want to smoke. Y ou know you don’t really\nenjoy this.’ It helps you feel like you’re not the victim\nanymore. Y ou start to realize that you don’t need  to\nsmoke.”\nI had never tried a cigarette, but I took a look at the\nbook afterward out of curiosity . The author employs an\ninteresting strategy to help smokers eliminate their\ncravings. He systematically reframes each cue associated\nwith smoking and gives it a new meaning.\nHe says things like:\nYou think you are quitting something, but you’re not\nquitting anything because cigarettes do nothing for\nyou.\nYou think smoking is something you need to do to be\nsocial, but it’s not. Y ou can be social without smoking\nat all.\nYou think smoking is about relieving stress, but it’s not.\nSmoking does not relieve",

One friend smokes, then you try it.”\nWhat was truly fascinating was that half of the people in\nthe room had managed to quit smoking. Mike had been\nsmoke-free for a few years at that point, and he swore up\nand down that he broke the habit because of a book called\nAllen Carr’s Easy W ay to Stop Smoking .\n“It frees you from the mental burden of smoking,” he\nsaid. “It tells you: ‘Stop lying to yourself . You know you\ndon’t actually want to smoke. Y ou know you don’t really\nenjoy this.’ It helps you feel like you’re not the victim\nanymore. Y ou start to realize that you don’t need  to\nsmoke.”\nI had never tried a cigarette, but I took a look at the\nbook afterward out of curiosity . The author employs an\ninteresting strategy to help smokers eliminate their\ncravings.

Y ou can be social without smoking\nat all.\nYou think smoking is about relieving stress, but it’s not.\nSmoking does not relieve your nerves, it destroys them.\nOver and over , he repeats these phrases and others like\nthem. “Get it clearly into your mind,” he says. “ You are\nlosing nothing and you are making marvelous positive gains\nnot only in health, energy and money but also in\nconﬁdence, self -respect, freedom and, most important of\nall, in the length and quality of your future life.”\nBy the time you get to the end of the book, smoking\nseems like the most ridiculous thing in the world to do . And\nif you no longer expect smoking to bring you any beneﬁts,\nyou have no reason to smoke. It is an inversion of the 2nd\nLaw of Behavior Change: make it unattractive .\nNow, I know this idea might sound overly simplistic. Just\nchange your mind and you can quit smoking. But stick with\nme for a minute.\nWHERE CRA VINGS COME FROM\nEvery behavior has a surface level craving and a deeper ,\nunderlying motive. I often have a craving that goes\nsomething like this: “I want to eat tacos.” If you were to ask\nme why I want to eat tacos, I wouldn’t say , “Because I need\nfood to survive.” But the truth is, somewhere deep down, I\nam motivated to eat tacos because I have to eat to survive.\nThe underlying motive is to obtain food and water even if\nmy speciﬁc craving is for a taco .\nSome of our underlying motives include: *\nConserve energy\nObtain food and water\nFind love and reproduce\nConnect and bond with others\nWin social acceptance and approval\nReduce uncertainty\nAchieve status and prestige\nA craving is just a speciﬁc manifestation of a deeper\nunderlying motive. Y our brain did not evolve with a desire\nto smoke cigarettes or to check Instagram or to play video\ngames. A t a deep level, you simply want to reduce\nuncertainty and relieve anxiety , to win social acceptance\nand approval, or to achieve status.\nLook at nearly any product that is habit-forming and\nyou’ll see that it does not create a new motivation, but\nrather latches onto the underlying motives of human\n",

But stick with\nme for a minute.\nWHERE CRA VINGS COME FROM\nEvery behavior has a surface level craving and a deeper ,\nunderlying motive. I often have a craving that goes\nsomething like this: “I want to eat tacos.” If you were to ask\nme why I want to eat tacos, I wouldn’t say , “Because I need\nfood to survive.” But the truth is, somewhere deep down, I\nam motivated to eat tacos because I have to eat to survive.\nThe underlying motive is to obtain food and water even if\nmy speciﬁc craving is for a taco .\nSome of our underlying motives include: *\nConserve energy\nObtain food and water\nFind love and reproduce\nConnect and bond with others\nWin social acceptance and approval\nReduce uncertainty\nAchieve status and prestige\nA craving is just a speciﬁc manifestation of a deeper\nunderlying motive. Y our brain did not evolve with a desire\nto smoke cigarettes or to check Instagram or to play video\ngames. A t a deep level, you simply want to reduce\nuncertainty and relieve anxiety",

    "text": "nature.\nFind love and reproduce = using Tinder\nConnect and bond with others = browsing F acebook\nWin social acceptance and approval = posting on\nInstagram\nReduce uncertainty = searching on Google\nAchieve status and prestige = playing video games\nYour habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires.\nNew versions of old vices. The underlying motives behind\nhuman behavior remain the same. The speciﬁc habits we\nperform diﬀer based on the period of history .\nHere’s the powerful part: there are many diﬀerent ways\nto address the same underlying motive. One person might\nlearn to reduce stress by smoking a cigarette. Another\nperson learns to ease their anxiety by going for a run. Y our\ncurrent habits are not necessarily the best way to solve the\nproblems you face; they are just the methods you learned\nto use. Once you associate a solution with the problem you\nneed to solve, you keep coming back to it.\nHabits are all about associations. These associations\ndetermine whether we predict a habit to be worth\nrepeating or not. As we covered in our discussion of the 1st\nLaw, your brain is continually absorbing information and\nnoticing cues in the environment. Every time you perceive\na cue, your brain runs a simulation and makes a prediction\nabout what to do in the next moment.\nCue: Y ou notice that the stove is hot.\nPrediction: If I touch it I’ll get burned, so I should avoid\ntouching it.\nCue: Y ou see that the traﬀic light turned green.\nPrediction: If I step on the gas, I’ll make it safely through\nthe intersection and get closer to my destination, so I\nshould step on the gas.\nYou see a cue, categorize it based on past experience, and\ndetermine the appropriate response.\nThis all happens in an instant, but it plays a crucial role\nin your habits because every action is preceded by a\nprediction. Life feels reactive, but it is actually predictive.\nAll day long, you are making your best guess of how to act\ngiven what you’ve just seen and what has worked for you in\nthe past. Y ou are endlessly predicting what will happen in\nthe next moment.\nOur behavior is heavily dependent on these predictions.\nPut another way , our behavior is heavily dependent on how\nwe interpret the events that happen to us, not necessarily\nthe objective reality of the events themselves. T wo people\ncan look at the same cigarette, and one feels the urge to\nsmoke while the other is repulsed by the smell. The same\ncue can spark a good habit or a bad habit depending on\nyour prediction. The cause of your habits is actually the\nprediction that precedes them.\nThese predictions lead to feelings, which is how we\ntypically describe a craving—a feeling, a desire, an urge.\nFeelings and emotions transform the cues we perceive and\nthe predictions we make into a signal that we can apply .\nThey help explain what we are currently sensing. F or\ninstance, whether or not you realize it, you are noticing\nhow warm or cold you feel right now . If the temperature\ndrops by one degree, you probably won’t do anything. If the\ntemperature drops ten degrees, however , you’ll feel cold\nand put on another layer of clothing. F eeling cold was the\nsignal that prompted you to act. Y ou have been sensing the\ncues the entire time, but it is only when you predict that\nyou would be better oﬀ in a diﬀerent state that you take\naction.\nA craving is the sense that something is missing. It is the\ndesire to change your internal state. When the temperature\nfalls, there is a gap between what your body is currently\nsensing and what it wants  to be sensing. This gap between\nyour current state and your desired state provides a reason\nto act.\nDesire is the diﬀerence between where you are now and\nwhere you want to be in the future. Even the tiniest action\nis tinged with the motivation to feel diﬀerently than you do\nin the moment. When you binge-eat or light up or browse\nsocial media, what you really want is not a potato chip or a\ncigarette or a bunch of likes. What you really want is to feel\ndiﬀerent.\nOur feelings and emotions tell us whether to hold steady\nin our current state or to make a change. They help us\ndecide the best course of action. Neurologists have\ndiscovered that when emotions and feelings are impaired,\nwe actually lose the ability to make decisions. W e have no\nsignal of what to pursue and what to avoid. As the\nneuroscientist Antonio Damasio explains, “It is emotion\nthat allows you to mark things",

The underlying motives behind\nhuman behavior remain the same. The speciﬁc habits we\nperform diﬀer based on the period of history .\nHere’s the powerful part: there are many diﬀerent ways\nto address the same underlying motive. One person might\nlearn to reduce stress by smoking a cigarette. Another\nperson learns to ease their anxiety by going for a run. Y our\ncurrent habits are not necessarily the best way to solve the\nproblems you face; they are just the methods you learned\nto use. Once you associate a solution with the problem you\nneed to solve, you keep coming back to it.\nHabits are all about associations. These associations\ndetermine whether we predict a habit to be worth\nrepeating or not. As we covered in our discussion of the 1st\nLaw, your brain is continually absorbing information and\nnoticing cues in the environment. Every time you perceive\na cue, your brain runs a simulation and makes a prediction\nabout what to do in the next moment.\nCue: Y ou notice that the stove is hot.\nPrediction: If I touch it I’ll get burned, so I should avoid\ntouching it.\nCue: Y ou see that the traﬀic light turned green.\nPrediction: If I step on the gas, I’ll make it safely through\nthe intersection and get closer to my destination, so I\nshould step on the gas.\nYou see a cue, categorize it based on past experience, and\ndetermine the appropriate response.\nThis all happens in an instant, but it plays a crucial role\nin your habits because every action is preceded by a\nprediction. Life feels reactive, but it is actually predictive.\nAll day long, you are making your best guess of how to act\ngiven what you’ve just seen and what has worked for you in\nthe past. Y ou are endlessly predicting what will happen in\nthe next moment.\nOur behavior is heavily dependent on these predictions.\nPut another way , our behavior is heavily dependent on how\nwe interpret the events that happen to us, not necessarily\nthe objective reality of the events themselves.",

    "text": " about associations. These associations\ndetermine whether we predict a habit to be worth\nrepeating or not. As we covered in our discussion of the 1st\nLaw, your brain is continually absorbing information and\nnoticing cues in the environment. Every time you perceive\na cue, your brain runs a simulation and makes a prediction\nabout what to do in the next moment.\nCue: Y ou notice that the stove is hot.\nPrediction: If I touch it I’ll get burned, so I should avoid\ntouching it.\nCue: Y ou see that the traﬀic light turned green.\nPrediction: If I step on the gas, I’ll make it safely through\nthe intersection and get closer to my destination, so I\nshould step on the gas.\nYou see a cue, categorize it based on past experience, and\ndetermine the appropriate response.\nThis all happens in an instant, but it plays a crucial role\nin your habits because every action is preceded by a\nprediction. Life feels reactive, but it is actually predictive.\nAll day long, you are making your best guess of how to act\ngiven what you’ve just seen and what has worked for you in\nthe past. Y ou are endlessly predicting",

    "text": " what will happen in\nthe next moment.\nOur behavior is heavily dependent on these predictions.\nPut another way , our behavior is heavily dependent on how\nwe interpret the events that happen to us, not necessarily\nthe objective reality of the events themselves. T wo people\ncan look at the same cigarette, and one feels the urge to\nsmoke while the other is repulsed by the smell. The same\ncue can spark a good habit or a bad habit depending on\nyour prediction. The cause of your habits is actually the\nprediction that precedes them.\nThese predictions lead to feelings, which is how we\ntypically describe a craving—a feeling, a desire, an urge.\nFeelings and emotions transform the cues we perceive and\nthe predictions we make into a signal that we can apply .\nThey help explain what we are currently sensing. F or\ninstance, whether or not you realize it, you are noticing\nhow warm or cold you feel right now . If the temperature\ndrops by one degree, you probably won’t do anything. If the\ntemperature drops ten degrees, however , you’ll feel cold\nand put on another layer of clothing. F eeling cold was the\nsignal that prompted you to act. Y ou have been sensing the\ncues the entire time, but it is only when you predict that\nyou would be better oﬀ in a diﬀerent state that you take\naction.\nA craving is the sense that something is missing. It is the\ndesire to change your internal state. When the temperature\nfalls, there is a gap between what your body is currently\nsensing and what it wants  to be sensing. This gap between\nyour current state and your desired state provides a reason\nto act.\nDesire is the diﬀerence between where you are now and\nwhere you want to be in the future. Even the tiniest action\nis tinged with the motivation to feel diﬀerently than you do\nin the moment. When you binge-eat or light up or browse\nsocial media, what you really want is not a potato chip or a\ncigarette or a bunch of likes. What you really want is to feel\ndiﬀerent.\nOur feelings and emotions tell us whether to hold steady\nin our current state or to make a change. They help us\ndecide the best course of action.

F eeling cold was the\nsignal that prompted you to act. Y ou have been sensing the\ncues the entire time, but it is only when you predict that\nyou would be better oﬀ in a diﬀerent state that you take\naction.\nA craving is the sense that something is missing.

    "text": " are impaired,\nwe actually lose the ability to make decisions. W e have no\nsignal of what to pursue and what to avoid. As the\nneuroscientist Antonio Damasio explains, “It is emotion\nthat allows you to mark things as good, bad, or indiﬀerent.”\nTo summarize, the speciﬁc cravings you feel and habits\nyou perform are really an attempt to address your\nfundamental underlying motives. Whenever a habit\nsuccessfully addresses a motive, you develop a craving to\ndo it again. In time, you learn to predict that checking\nsocial media will help you feel loved or that watching\nYouTube will allow you to forget your fears. Habits are\nattractive when we associate them with positive feelings,\nand we can use this insight to our advantage rather than to\nour detriment.\nHOW TO REPROGRAM Y OUR BRAIN TO ENJO Y HARD\nHABITS\nYou can make hard habits more attractive if you can learn\nto associate them with a positive experience. Sometimes,\nall you need is a slight mind-set shift. F or instance, we\noften talk about everything we have to do in a given day .\nYou have to wake up early for work. Y ou have to make\nanother sales call for your business. Y ou have to cook\ndinner for your family .\nNow, imagine changing just one word: You don’t “have”\nto. You “get” to .\nYou get to wake up early for work. Y ou get to make\nanother sales call for your business. Y ou get to cook dinner\nfor your family . By simply changing one word, you shift the\nway you view each event. Y ou transition from seeing these\nbehaviors as burdens and turn them into opportunities.\nThe key point is that both versions of reality are true.\nYou have  to do those things, and you also get to do them.\nWe can ﬁnd evidence for whatever mind-set we choose.\nI once heard a story about a man who uses a wheelchair .\nWhen asked if it was diﬀicult being conﬁned, he responded,\n“I’m not conﬁned to my wheelchair—I am liberated by it. If\nit wasn’t for my wheelchair , I would be bed-bound and\nnever able to leave my house.” This shift in perspective\ncompletely transformed how he lived each day .\nReframing your habits to highlight their beneﬁts  rather\nthan their drawbacks is a fast and lightweight way to\nreprogram your mind and make a habit seem more\nattractive.\nExercise. Many people associate exercise with being a\nchallenging task that drains energy and wears you down.\nYou can just as easily view it as a way to develop skills and\nbuild you up. Instead of telling yourself “I need to go run in\nthe morning,” say “ It’s time to build endurance and get\nfast.”\nFinance.  Saving money is often associated with\nsacriﬁce. However , you can associate it with freedom\nrather than limitation if you realize one simple truth: living\nbelow your current means increases  your future means.\nThe money you save this month increases your purchasing\npower next month.\nMeditation.  Anyone who has tried meditation for more\nthan three seconds knows how frustrating it can be when\nthe next distraction inevitably pops into your mind. Y ou can\ntransform frustration into delight when you realize that\neach interruption gives you a chance to practice returning\nto your breath. Distraction is a good thing because you\nneed distractions to practice meditation.\nPregame jitters.  Many people feel anxious before\ndelivering a big presentation or competing in an important\nevent. They experience quicker breathing, a faster heart\nrate, heightened arousal. If we interpret these feelings\nnegatively , then we feel threatened and tense up. If we\ninterpret these feelings positively , then we can respond\nwith ﬂuidity and grace. Y ou can reframe “I am nervous” to\n“I am excited and I’m getting an adrenaline rush to help me\nconcentrate.”\nThese little mind-set shifts aren’t magic, but they can\nhelp change the feelings you associate with a particular\nhabit or situation.\nIf you want to take it a step further , you can create a\nmotivation ritual . You simply practice associating your\nhabits with something you enjoy , then you can use that cue\nwhenever you need a bit of motivation. F or instance, if you\nalways play the same song before having sex, then you’ll\nbegin to link the music with the act. Whenever you want to\nget in the mood, just press play .\nEd Latimore, a boxer and writer from Pittsburgh,\nbeneﬁted from a similar strategy without knowing it. “Odd\nrealization,” he wrote. “My focus and concentration goes\nup just by putting my headphones [on] while writing. I\ndon’t even have to play",

As the\nneuroscientist Antonio Damasio explains, “It is emotion\nthat allows you to mark things as good, bad, or indiﬀerent.”\nTo summarize, the speciﬁc cravings you feel and habits\nyou perform are really an attempt to address your\nfundamental underlying motives. Whenever a habit\nsuccessfully addresses a motive, you develop a craving to\ndo it again. In time, you learn to predict that checking\nsocial media will help you feel loved or that watching\nYouTube will allow you to forget your fears. Habits are\nattractive when we associate them with positive feelings,\nand we can use this insight to our advantage rather than to\nour detriment.\nHOW TO REPROGRAM Y OUR BRAIN TO ENJO Y HARD\nHABITS\nYou can make hard habits more attractive if you can learn\nto associate them with a positive experience. Sometimes,\nall you need is a slight mind-set shift. F or instance, we\noften talk about everything we have to do in a given day .\nYou have to wake up early for work. Y ou have to make\nanother sales call for your business. Y ou have to cook\ndinner for your family .\nNow, imagine changing just one word: You don’t “have”\nto. You “get” to .\nYou get to wake up early for work. Y ou get to make\nanother sales call for your business. Y ou get to cook dinner\nfor your family . By simply changing one word, you shift the\nway you view each event. Y ou transition from seeing these\nbehaviors as burdens and turn them into opportunities.\nThe key point is that both versions of reality are true.\nYou have  to do those things, and you also get to do them.\nWe can ﬁnd evidence for whatever mind-set we choose.\nI once heard a story about a man who uses a wheelchair .\nWhen asked if it was diﬀicult being conﬁned, he responded,\n“I’m not conﬁned to my wheelchair—I am liberated by it. If\nit wasn’t for my wheelchair , I would be bed-bound and\nnever able to leave my house.” This shift in perspective\ncompletely transformed how he lived each day .\nReframing your habits to highlight their beneﬁts  rather\nthan their drawbacks is a fast and",

F or instance, we\noften talk about everything we have to do in a given day .\nYou have to wake up early for work. Y ou have to make\nanother sales call for your business. Y ou have to cook\ndinner for your family .\nNow, imagine changing just one word: You don’t “have”\nto. You “get” to .\nYou get to wake up early for work. Y ou get to make\nanother sales call for your business. Y ou get to cook dinner\nfor your family . By simply changing one word, you shift the\nway you view each event.

    "text": " I would be bed-bound and\nnever able to leave my house.” This shift in perspective\ncompletely transformed how he lived each day .\nReframing your habits to highlight their beneﬁts  rather\nthan their drawbacks is a fast and lightweight way to\nreprogram your mind and make a habit seem more\nattractive.\nExercise. Many people associate exercise with being a\nchallenging task that drains energy and wears you down.\nYou can just as easily view it as a way to develop skills and\nbuild you up. Instead of telling yourself “I need to go run in\nthe morning,” say “ It’s time to build endurance and get\nfast.”\nFinance.  Saving money is often associated with\nsacriﬁce. However , you can associate it with freedom\nrather than limitation if you realize one simple truth: living\nbelow your current means increases  your future means.\nThe money you save this month increases your purchasing\npower next month.\nMeditation.  Anyone who has tried meditation for more\nthan three seconds knows how frustrating it can be when\nthe next distraction inevitably pops into your mind. Y ou can\ntransform frustration into delight when you realize that\neach interruption gives you a chance to practice returning\nto your breath. Distraction is a good thing because you\nneed distractions to practice meditation.\nPregame jitters.  Many people feel anxious before\ndelivering a big presentation or competing in an important\nevent. They experience quicker breathing, a faster heart\nrate, heightened arousal. If we interpret these feelings\nnegatively , then we feel threatened and tense up. If we\ninterpret these feelings positively , then we can respond\nwith ﬂuidity and grace. Y ou can reframe “I am nervous” to\n“I am excited and I’m getting an adrenaline rush to help me\nconcentrate.”\nThese little mind-set shifts aren’t magic, but they can\nhelp change the feelings you associate with a particular\nhabit or situation.\nIf you want to take it a step further , you can create a\nmotivation ritual . You simply practice associating your\nhabits with something you enjoy , then you can use that cue\nwhenever you need a bit of motivation. F or instance, if you\nalways play the same song before having sex, then you’ll\nbegin to link the music with the act. Whenever you want to\nget in the mood, just press play .\nEd Latimore, a boxer and writer from Pittsburgh",

Y ou can\ntransform frustration into delight when you realize that\neach interruption gives you a chance to practice returning\nto your breath. Distraction is a good thing because you\nneed distractions to practice meditation.\nPregame jitters.  Many people feel anxious before\ndelivering a big presentation or competing in an important\nevent. They experience quicker breathing, a faster heart\nrate, heightened arousal. If we interpret these feelings\nnegatively , then we feel threatened and tense up. If we\ninterpret these feelings positively , then we can respond\nwith ﬂuidity and grace. Y ou can reframe “I am nervous” to\n“I am excited and I’m getting an adrenaline rush to help me\nconcentrate.”\nThese little mind-set shifts aren’t magic, but they can\nhelp change the feelings you associate with a particular\nhabit or situation.\nIf you want to take it a step further , you can create a\nmotivation ritual . You simply practice associating your\nhabits with something you enjoy , then you can use that cue\nwhenever you need a bit of motivation. F or instance",

I\ndon’t even have to play any music.” W ithout realizing it, he\nwas conditioning himself . In the beginning, he put his\nheadphones on, played some music he enjoyed, and did\nfocused work. A fter doing it ﬁve, ten, twenty times, putting\nhis headphones on became a cue that he automatically\nassociated with increased focus. The craving followed\nnaturally .\nAthletes use similar strategies to get themselves in the\nmind-set to perform. During my baseball career , I\ndeveloped a speciﬁc ritual of stretching and throwing\nbefore each game. The whole sequence took about ten\nminutes, and I did it the same way every single time. While\nit physically warmed me up to play , more importantly , it put\nme in the right mental state. I began to associate my\npregame ritual with feeling competitive and focused. Even\nif I wasn’t motivated beforehand, by the time I was done\nwith my ritual, I was in “game mode.”\nYou can adapt this strategy for nearly any purpose. Say\nyou want to feel happier in general. Find something that\nmakes you truly happy—like petting your dog or taking a\nbubble bath—and then create a short routine that you\nperform every time before  you do the thing you love.\nMaybe you take three deep breaths and smile.\nThree deep breaths. Smile. P et the dog. Repeat.\nEventually , you’ll begin to associate this breathe-and-\nsmile routine with being in a good mood. It becomes a cue\nthat means  feeling happy . Once established, you can break\nit out anytime you need to change your emotional state.\nStressed at work? T ake three deep breaths and smile. Sad\nabout life? Three deep breaths and smile. Once a habit has\nbeen built, the cue can prompt a craving, even if it has little\nto do with the original situation.\nThe key to ﬁnding and ﬁxing the causes of your bad\nhabits is to reframe the associations you have about them.\nIt’s not easy , but if you can reprogram your predictions, you\ncan transform a hard habit into an attractive one.\nChapter Summary\nThe inversion of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change is\nmake it unattractive .\nEvery behavior has a surface level craving and a\ndeeper underlying motive.\nYour habits are modern-day solutions to ancient\ndesires.\nThe cause of your habits is actually the prediction that\nprecedes them. The prediction leads to a feeling.\nHighlight the beneﬁts of avoiding a bad habit to make\nit seem unattractive.\nHabits are attractive when we associate them with\npositive feelings and unattractive when we associate\nthem with negative feelings. Create a motivation ritual\nby doing something you enjoy immediately before a\ndiﬀicult habit.\nHOW TO CREA TE A GOOD HABIT\nThe 1st Law: Mak e It Obvious\n1.1: Fill out the Habits Scor ecard. Write down your cur rent habits to become\nawar e of them.\n1.2: Use implementation intentions: “I will [BEHA VIOR] at [TIME] in\n[LOCATION].”\n1.3: Use habit stacking: “After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”\n1.4: Design your envir onment.

While\nit physically warmed me up to play , more importantly , it put\nme in the right mental state. I began to associate my\npregame ritual with feeling competitive and focused. Even\nif I wasn’t motivated beforehand, by the time I was done\nwith my ritual, I was in “game mode.”\nYou can adapt this strategy for nearly any purpose. Say\nyou want to feel happier in general. Find something that\nmakes you truly happy—like petting your dog or taking a\nbubble bath—and then create a short routine that you\nperform every time before  you do the thing you love.\nMaybe you take three deep breaths and smile.\nThree deep breaths. Smile. P et the dog. Repeat.\nEventually , you’ll begin to associate this breathe-and-\nsmile routine with being in a good mood. It becomes a cue\nthat means  feeling happy . Once established, you can break\nit out anytime you need to change your emotional state.\nStressed at work? T ake three deep breaths and smile. Sad\nabout life? Three deep breaths and smile. Once a habit has\nbeen built, the cue can prompt a craving, even if it has little\nto do with the original situation.\nThe key to ﬁnding and ﬁxing the causes of your bad\nhabits is to reframe the associations you have about them.\nIt’s not easy , but if you can reprogram your predictions, you\ncan transform a hard habit into an attractive one.\nChapter Summary\nThe inversion of the 2nd Law of Behavior",

Even\nif I wasn’t motivated beforehand, by the time I was done\nwith my ritual, I was in “game mode.”\nYou can adapt this strategy for nearly any purpose. Say\nyou want to feel happier in general. Find something that\nmakes you truly happy—like petting your dog or taking a\nbubble bath—and then create a short routine that you\nperform every time before  you do the thing you love.\nMaybe you take three deep breaths and smile.\nThree deep breaths. Smile. P et the dog. Repeat.\nEventually , you’ll begin to associate this breathe-and-\nsmile routine with being in a good mood. It becomes a cue\nthat means  feeling happy . Once established, you can break\nit out anytime you need to change your emotional state.\nStressed at work? T ake three deep breaths and smile. Sad\nabout life? Three deep breaths and smile. Once a habit has\nbeen built, the cue can prompt a craving, even if it has little\nto do with the original situation.\nThe key to ﬁnding and ﬁxing the causes of your bad\nhabits",
