Drop-in Visitors:  Taking time-log of visits and implementing a plan to arrange and\nscreen appointments is an effective way of dealing with drop-in visitors. Managers\ncan also have ‘Open Door’ and ‘Quiet Hour” timings fixed so that they are not distracted\nwhen certain of their tasks demand undivided personal attention.\nc. Meetings:  Setting a clear agenda before will provide the right direction to the meetings\nand elicit positive outcomes from them. Selecting an appropriate location and\nassessing the needs of participation, information and coordination are also important\nprerequisites in conducting meetings. Concise minutes summarizing decisions,assignments and deadlines followed by effective follow-up on decisions make\nmeetings purposeful.Time - Saving Tips : Interruptions\n•   Close your door\n•   Distinguish between necessary visits\n    and interruptions\n•   Use different techniques\n    - Visit others\n    - Arrange appointment\n    - Leave your office\n    - Establish regular meeting time11  Overcoming Barriers to Effective Time Management\na. Telephone Interruptions:  Delegation of authority and responsibility is an ideal way\nof controlling telephone interruptions. Also fixing specific time slots for socializing andbusiness will help the managers effectively reduce the telephone interruptions.\nImplementation of the screening procedures also lessen the burden of unwanted\ntelephone intrusions.\nSoft Skills for Public Managers\n44d. Lack of Priorities:  Putting first things first helps managers spend relatively more\ntime on activities that are important. Managers must realize that most of the problemsarise due to action without thought. Defining clearly the objectives and priorities and\ndeadlines in the form of a Daily Planner will help managers effectively use their time.\ne. Personal Disorganization:  Managers must recognize that personal disorganization,\nindecision, procrastination, insecurity, confusion of priority, and inability to meet\ndeadlines are mostly due to lost documents. Uncluttered desk, orderly filing systemand simplified procedures will help the managers make the most of time management.\nThrough a system in place for screening junk mails, minimizing paperwork and\nemphasis on brevity, managers can overcome their personal disorganization.Time - Saving Tips : Meetings\n•   Request agenda\n•   Arrive early•   Notify chair if your will be late•   Avoid routine, emergency, impromptu\n    meetings\n•   Avoid Monday mornings, Friday\n    afternoons\nTime - Saving Tips : Managing E-mails\n•   Know your system’s special features\n•   List serves•   Same time every day•   Use Web services - (examples)    - IFAP.ed.gov\n    - NASFAA Today New\nHandbook on Time Management Skills\n45f. Ineffective Delegation:  Managers must ensure that clear, unambiguous\ninstructions are given to the subordinates. They should establish plans, schedules\nwith details, progress reports, monitoring of deadlines, and emphasize goal-accomplishment methods and procedures. They should measure results rather\nthan activity and track progress of an activity to take timely corrective actions.\ng. Attempting too much:  Managers must set their objectives, priorities, and\ndeadlines daily so that they must plan, start early and always remember Murphy’s\n2\nnd Law: “Recognize that everything takes longer than you think”. They must limit\ntheir response to the urgent and important demands. They should learn to say“No” when necessary.\nh. Unclear Communication:  Managers must assess the legitimate needs for\ninformation and check for interference, noise or activity in the flow of information.\nThey should also assess potential impact of unclear communication, take preventive\nsteps and minimize organizational levels. If it is difficult to minimize organizationallevels, they should facilitate easy flow of information across the organization.\ni. Inadequate, Inaccurate or Delayed Information:  Managers must determine\nwhat information is needed for planning, decisions and feedback on results. Thenthey should ensure its availability, reliability and timeliness.\nj. Indecision/ Procrastination:  Managers must set deadlines on all objectives and\npriorities, use reminders, have the secretary check on the progress, reward\nthemselves (no coffee until they finish). They should avoid fixing blame; ask what’s\nbeen learned and how repetition can be avoided.\nk. Confused Authority / Responsibility:  Managers must lay emphasis on\naccountability for results; through recognition and reward for exercise of initiative;\nthrough citation, consideration in performance and salary review, promotion, etc.\nl. Inability to say ‘No’:  Managers must recognize that inability to say ‘No’ is a major\ncause of time wastage. They should understand that saying “Yes” may betray\nSoft Skills for Public Managers\n46feelings of insecurity and low self-worth and should resist this urge. They should\ntake time log recording all “Yes” responses that could have been “No” and assess\nthe time wasted. They should learn to say “No”,",

Ineffective Delegation:  Managers must ensure that clear, unambiguous\ninstructions are given to the subordinates. They should establish plans, schedules\nwith details, progress reports, monitoring of deadlines, and emphasize goal-accomplishment methods and procedures. They should measure results rather\nthan activity and track progress of an activity to take timely corrective actions.\ng. Attempting too much:  Managers must set their objectives, priorities, and\ndeadlines daily so that they must plan, start early and always remember Murphy’s\n2\nnd Law: “Recognize that everything takes longer than you think”. They must limit\ntheir response to the urgent and important demands. They should learn to say“No” when necessary.\nh. Unclear Communication:  Managers must assess the legitimate needs for\ninformation and check for interference, noise or activity in the flow of information.\nThey should also assess potential impact of unclear communication, take preventive\nsteps and minimize organizational levels. If it is difficult to minimize organizationallevels, they should facilitate easy flow of information across the organization.\ni. Inadequate, Inaccurate or Delayed Information:  Managers must determine\nwhat information is needed for planning, decisions and feedback on results. Thenthey should ensure its availability, reliability and timeliness.\nj. Indecision/ Procrastination:  Managers must set deadlines on all objectives and\npriorities, use reminders, have the secretary check on the progress, reward\nthemselves (no coffee until they finish). They should avoid fixing blame; ask what’s\nbeen learned and how repetition can be avoided.\nk. Confused Authority / Responsibility:  Managers must lay emphasis on\naccountability for results; through recognition and reward for exercise of initiative;\nthrough citation, consideration in performance and salary review, promotion, etc.\nl. Inability to say ‘No’:  Managers must recognize that inability to say ‘No’ is a major\ncause of time wastage. They should understand that saying “Yes” may betray\nSoft Skills for Public Managers\n",

I’ve been neglecting them too much.”• “Thanks for the compliment, but I’m afraid I’ll have to decline. maybe next year.”\n• If a request catches you off-guard, don’t say anything until you count to ten first.\nHandbook on Time Management Skills\n47m.

They should learn to say “No”, especially to inappropriate orthoughtless requests. Dr Mackenzie suggests four steps to say NO and it is\npresented in the BOX on the next page for quick reference.\nDr. Mackenzie’s Four Steps to Saying “No.”\n1. Listen\nThis lets the requesting person know you’re giving full attention to the request and lets\nyou fully understand what is being asked.\n2. Say “No” politely but firmly right away\nDon’t build false hopes with wishy-washy answers.\n3. Give your reasons, if appropriate\nYour reasons may include your priorities, your schedule, etc. This reinforces your\ncredibility.\n4. Offer alternatives, if possible\nDemonstrate your good faith by suggesting other ways to meet the person’s need.\nThere are many ways to say “No” after listening to a request that you simplycannot handle.\nDr. Mackenzie offers a few:\n• “I’m sorry, my other commitments just won’t permit me to take on another project rightnow.”\n• “You know, on New Year’s Day I promised my family I wouldn’t take on anything else\nthis year. I’ve been neglecting them too much.”• “Thanks for the compliment, but I’m afraid I’ll have to decline. maybe next year.”\n• If a request catches you off-guard, don’t say anything until you count to ten first.\nHandbook on Time Management Skills\n47m. Leaving tasks unfinished:  Managers must take time log and assess the impact of\nleaving tasks unfinished. They should set deadlines on all important tasks to provide\nincentive to complete them. They should get organized to permit effective control oftasks. They should recognize that sound organization saves time in retrieving\ninformation, processing decisions, and maintaining control over projects.\nn. Lack of Self-Discipline:  When a manager switches priorities of his team, he makes\nself-discipline difficult to practice. S/he should take time log to record frequency, assess\ncost, discuss with colleagues to seek ways of reducing problem.\nSoft Skills for Public Managers\n48Time-Wasters: Causes & Solutions\nLack of planning Failure to see the\nbenefit of planningRecognize that planning may\ntake time but it saves time\nand effort in the long run.\nLack",

    "text": " to say “No” after listening to a request that you simplycannot handle.\nDr. Mackenzie offers a few:\n• “I’m sorry, my other commitments just won’t permit me to take on another project rightnow.”\n• “You know, on New Year’s Day I promised my family I wouldn’t take on anything else\nthis year. I’ve been neglecting them too much.”• “Thanks for the compliment, but I’m afraid I’ll have to decline. maybe next year.”\n• If a request catches you off-guard, don’t say anything until you count to ten first.\nHandbook on Time Management Skills\n47m. Leaving tasks unfinished:  Managers must take time log and assess the impact of\nleaving tasks unfinished. They should set deadlines on all important tasks to provide\nincentive to complete them. They should get organized to permit effective control oftasks. They should recognize that sound organization saves time in retrieving\ninformation, processing decisions, and maintaining control over projects.\nn. Lack of Self-Discipline:  When a manager switches priorities of his team, he makes\nself-discipline difficult to practice. S/he should take time log to record frequency, assess\ncost, discuss with colleagues to seek ways of reducing problem.\n",

How to Get Control of Your Time and Your Life\nSoft Skills for Public Managers\n56Appendix\nTime Management Facts and Figures\n80% of “crisis management” events are preventable.One hour of planning will save 10 hours of doing.\nGood time managers do not allocate their time to those who “demand” it, but\nrather to those who “deserve” it.\nThe most powerful word in our time management vocabulary is “no.”\nDelegation is an unlimited method to multiply time for achieving results.\nThe hardest part about delegation is simply letting go “If you want a job done\nright, you have to do it yourself.”\nDr. Donald E. Wetmore -Productivity Institute\nTime Management Facts and Figures\n- Nine out of 10 people daydream in meetings.\n- 60% of meeting attendees take notes to appear as if they are listening.\n- When someone is asking for our time for a meeting, 80% of the time there is an\nalternate date and time that will be acceptable.\nDr. Donald E.

How to Get Control of Your Time and Your Life\nSoft Skills for Public Managers\n56Appendix\nTime Management Facts and Figures\n80% of “crisis management” events are preventable.One hour of planning will save 10 hours of doing.\nGood time managers do not allocate their time to those who “demand” it, but\nrather to those who “deserve” it.\nThe most powerful word in our time management vocabulary is “no.”\nDelegation is an unlimited method to multiply time for achieving results.\nThe hardest part about delegation is simply letting go “If you want a job done\nright, you have to do it yourself.”\nDr. Donald E. Wetmore -Productivity Institute\nTime Management Facts and Figures\n- Nine out of 10 people daydream in meetings.\n- 60% of meeting attendees take notes to appear as if they are listening.\n- When someone is asking for our time for a meeting, 80% of the time there is an\nalternate date and time that will be acceptable.\n",
