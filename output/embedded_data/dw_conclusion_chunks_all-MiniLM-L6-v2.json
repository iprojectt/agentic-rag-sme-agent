    "text": "Conclusion\nThe story of Microsoft’s founding has \nbeen told so many times that it’s entered \nthe realm of legend. In the winter of \n1974, a young Harvard student named \nBill Gates sees the Altair, the world’s \nfirst personal computer, on the cover of \nPopular Electronics.  Gates realizes that \nthere’s an opportunity to design software \nfor the machine, so he drops everything \nand with the help of Paul Allen and\n\nMonte Davidoff spends the next eight \nweeks hacking together a version of the \nBASIC programming language for the \nAltair. This story is often cited as an \nexample of Gates’s insight and boldness, \nbut recent interviews have revealed \nanother trait that played a crucial role in \nthe tale’s happy ending: Gates’s\npreternatural deep work ability.\nAs Walter Isaacson explained in a \n2013 article on the topic for the Harvard  \nGazette , Gates worked with such \nintensity for such lengths during this \ntwo-month stretch that he would often \ncollapse into sleep on his keyboard in \nthe middle of writing a line of code. He \nwould then sleep for an hour or two,\n\nwake up, and pick up right where he left \noff—an ability that a still-impressed \nPaul Allen describes as “a prodigious \nfeat of concentration.” In his book The \nInnovators , Isaacson later summarized \nGates’s unique tendency toward depth as \nfollows: “The one trait that\ndifferentiated [Gates from Allen] was \nfocus. Allen’s mind would flit between \nmany ideas and passions, but Gates was \na serial obsessor.”\nIt’s here, in this story of Gates’s \nobsessive focus, that we encounter the \nstrongest form of my argument for deep \nwork. It’s easy, amid the turbulence of a \nrapidly evolving information age, to \ndefault to dialectical grumbling. The\n\ncurmudgeons among us are vaguely \nuneasy about the attention people pay to \ntheir phones, and pine for the days of \nunhurried concentration, while the \ndigital hipsters equate such nostalgia \nwith Luddism and boredom, and believe \nthat increased connection is the \nfoundation for a utopian future. Marshall \nMcLuhan declared that “the medium is \nthe message,” but our current \nconversation on these topics seems to \nimply that “the medium is morality”— \neither you’re on board with the \nFacebook future or see it as our \ndownfall.\nAs I emphasized in this book’s \nintroduction, I have no interest in this\n\ndebate. A commitment to deep work is \nnot a moral stance and it’s not a \nphilosophical statement—it is instead a \npragmatic recognition that the ability to \nconcentrate is a skill that gets valuable  \nthings done.  Deep work is important, in \nother words, not because distraction is \nevil, but because it enabled Bill Gates to \nstart a billion-dollar industry in less than \na semester.\nThis is also a lesson, as it turns out, \nthat I’ve personally relearned again and \nagain in my own career. I’ve been a \ndepth devotee for more than a decade, \nbut even I am still regularly surprised by \nits power. When I was in graduate \nschool, the period when I first\n\nencountered and started prioritizing this \nskill, I found that deep work allowed me \nto write a pair of quality peer-reviewed \npapers each year (a respectable rate for \na student), while rarely having to work \npast five on weekdays or work at all on \nweekends (a rarity among my peers).\nAs I neared my transition to \nprofessorship, however, I began to \nworry. As a student and a postdoc my \ntime commitments were minimal— \nleaving me most of my day to shape as I \ndesired. I knew I would lose this luxury \nin the next phase of my career, and I \nwasn’t confident in my ability to \nintegrate enough deep work into this \nmore demanding schedule to maintain\n\nmy productivity. Instead of just stewing \nin my anxiety, I decided to do something \nabout it: I created a plan to bolster my \ndeep work muscles.\nThese training efforts were deployed \nduring my last two years at MIT, while I \nwas a postdoc starting to look for \nprofessor positions. My main tactic was \nto introduce artificial constraints on my \nschedule, so as to better approximate the \nmore limited free time I expected as a \nprofessor. In addition to my rule about \nnot working at night, I started to take \nextended lunch breaks in the middle of \nthe day to go for a run and then eat lunch \nback at my apartment. I also signed a \ndeal to write my fourth book, So Good\n\nThey Can’ t Ignore You,  during this \nperiod— a project,",

    "text": "Conclusion\nThe story of Microsoft’s founding has \nbeen told so many times that it’s entered \nthe realm of legend. In the winter of \n1974, a young Harvard student named \nBill Gates sees the Altair, the world’s \nfirst personal computer, on the cover of \nPopular Electronics.  Gates realizes that \nthere’s an opportunity to design software \nfor the machine, so he drops everything \nand with the help of Paul Allen and\n\nMonte Davidoff spends the next eight \nweeks hacking together a version of the \nBASIC programming language for the \nAltair. This story is often cited as an \nexample of Gates’s insight and boldness, \nbut recent interviews have revealed \nanother trait that played a crucial role in \nthe tale’s happy ending: Gates’s\npreternatural deep work ability.\nAs Walter Isaacson explained in a \n2013 article on the topic for the Harvard  \nGazette , Gates worked with such \nintensity for such lengths during this \ntwo-month stretch that he would often \ncollapse into sleep on his keyboard in \nthe middle of writing a line of code. He \nwould then sleep for an hour or two,\n\nwake up, and pick up right where he left \noff—an ability that a still-impressed \nPaul Allen describes as “a prodigious \nfeat of concentration.” In his book The \nInnovators , Isaacson later summarized \nGates’s unique tendency toward depth as \nfollows: “The one trait that\ndifferentiated [Gates from Allen] was \nfocus. Allen’s mind would flit between \nmany ideas and passions, but Gates was \na serial obsessor.”\nIt’s here, in this story of Gates’s \nobsessive focus, that we encounter the \nstrongest form of my argument for deep \nwork. It’s easy, amid the turbulence of a \nrapidly evolving information age, to \ndefault to dialectical grumbling. The\n\ncurmudgeons among us are vaguely \nuneasy about the attention people pay to \ntheir phones, and pine for the days of \nunhurried concentration, while the \ndigital hipsters equate such nostalgia \nwith Luddism and boredom, and believe \nthat increased connection is the \nfoundation for a utopian future. Marshall \nMcLuhan declared that “the medium is \nthe message,” but our current \nconversation on these topics seems to \nimply that “the medium is morality”— \neither you’re on board with the \nFacebook future",

    "text": " utopian future. Marshall \nMcLuhan declared that “the medium is \nthe message,” but our current \nconversation on these topics seems to \nimply that “the medium is morality”— \neither you’re on board with the \nFacebook future or see it as our \ndownfall.\nAs I emphasized in this book’s \nintroduction, I have no interest in this\n\ndebate. A commitment to deep work is \nnot a moral stance and it’s not a \nphilosophical statement—it is instead a \npragmatic recognition that the ability to \nconcentrate is a skill that gets valuable  \nthings done.  Deep work is important, in \nother words, not because distraction is \nevil, but because it enabled Bill Gates to \nstart a billion-dollar industry in less than \na semester.\nThis is also a lesson, as it turns out, \nthat I’ve personally relearned again and \nagain in my own career. I’ve been a \ndepth devotee for more than a decade, \nbut even I am still regularly surprised by \nits power. When I was in graduate \nschool, the period when I first\n\nencountered and started prioritizing this \nskill, I found that deep work allowed me \nto write a pair of quality peer-reviewed \npapers each year (a respectable rate for \na student), while rarely having to work \npast five on weekdays or work at all on \nweekends (a rarity among my peers).\nAs I neared my transition to \nprofessorship, however, I began to \nworry. As a student and a postdoc my \ntime commitments were minimal— \nleaving me most of my day to shape as I \ndesired. I knew I would lose this luxury \nin the next phase of my career, and I \nwasn’t confident in my ability to \nintegrate enough deep work into this \nmore demanding schedule to maintain\n\nmy productivity. Instead of just stewing \nin my anxiety, I decided to do something \nabout it: I created a plan to bolster my \ndeep work muscles.\nThese training efforts were deployed \nduring my last two years at MIT, while I \nwas a postdoc starting to look for \nprofessor positions. My main tactic was \nto introduce artificial constraints on my \nschedule, so as to better approximate the \nmore limited free time I expected as a \nprofessor. In addition to my rule about \nnot working at night, I started to take \nextended lunch breaks in the middle",

    "text": " of \nthe day to go for a run and then eat lunch \nback at my apartment. I also signed a \ndeal to write my fourth book, So Good\n\nThey Can’ t Ignore You,  during this \nperiod— a project, of course, that soon \nlevied its own intense demands on my \ntime.\nTo compensate for these new \nconstraints, I refined my ability to work \ndeeply. Among other methods, I began to \nmore carefully block out deep work \nhours and preserve them against \nincursion. I also developed an ability to \ncarefully work through thoughts during \nthe many hours I spent on foot each week \n(a boon to my productivity), and became \nobsessive about finding disconnected \nlocations conducive to focus. During the \nsummer, for example, I would often \nwork under the dome in Barker\n\nEngineering library—a pleasingly\ncavernous location that becomes too \ncrowded when class is in session, and \nduring the winter, I sought more obscure \nlocations for some silence, eventually \ndeveloping a preference for the small \nbut well-appointed Lewis Music \nLibrary. At some point, I even bought a \n$50 high-end grid-lined lab notebook to \nwork on mathematical proofs, believing \nthat its expense would induce more care \nin my thinking.\nI ended up surprised by how well \nthis recommitment to depth ended up \nworking. After I’d taken a job as a \ncomputer science professor at \nGeorgetown University in the fall of\n\n2011, my obligations did in fact \ndrastically increase. But I had been \ntraining for this moment. Not only did I \npreserve my research productivity; it \nactually improved.  My previous rate of \ntwo good papers a year, which I \nmaintained as an unencumbered graduate \nstudent, leapt to four good papers a year, \non average, once I became a much more \nencumbered professor.\nImpressive as this was to me, \nhowever, I was soon to learn that I had \nnot yet reached the limits of what deep \nwork could produce. This lesson would \ncome during my third year as a \nprofessor. During my third year at \nGeorgetown, which spanned the fall of\n\n2013 through the summer of 2014, I \nturned my attention back to my deep \nwork habits, searching for more \nopportunities to improve. A big reason \nfor this recommitment to depth is the \nbook you’re currently reading—most of \nwhich was written during this period. \nWriting a seventy-thousand-word book \nmanuscript, of course, placed a sudden \nnew constraint on my already busy \nschedule, and I wanted to make sure my \nacademic productivity didn’t take a \ncorresponding hit. Another reason I \nturned back to depth was the looming \ntenure process. I had a year or two of \npublications left before my tenure case \nwas submitted. This was the time, in\n\nother words, to make a statement about \nmy abilities (especially given that my \nwife and I were planning on growing our \nfamily with a second child in the final \nyear before tenure). The final reason I \nturned back to depth was more personal \nand (admittedly) a touch petulant. I had \napplied and been rejected for a well- \nrespected grant that many of my \ncolleagues were receiving. I was upset \nand embarrassed, so I decided that \ninstead of just complaining or \nwallowing in self-doubt, I would \ncompensate for losing the grant by \nincreasing the rate and impressiveness \nof my publications—allowing them to \ndeclare on my behalf that I actually did\n\nknow what I was doing, even if this one \nparticular grant application didn’t go my \nway.\nI was already an adept deep worker, \nbut these three forces drove me to push \nthis habit to an extreme. I became \nruthless in turning down time-consuming \ncommitments and began to work more in \nisolated locations outside my office. I \nplaced a tally of my deep work hours in \na prominent position near my desk and \ngot upset when it failed to grow at a fast \nenough rate. Perhaps most impactful, I \nreturned to my MIT habit of working on \nproblems in my head whenever a good \ntime presented itself—be it walking the \ndog or commuting. Whereas earlier, I\n\ntended to increase my deep work only as \na deadline approached, this year I was \nrelentless—most every day of most \nevery week I was pushing my mind to \ngrapple with results of consequence, \nregardless of whether or not a specific \ndeadline was near. I solved proofs on \nsubway rides and while shoveling snow. \nWhen my son napped on the weekend, I \nwould pace the yard thinking, and when \nstuck in traffic I would methodically",

I also signed a \ndeal to write my fourth book, So Good\n\nThey Can’ t Ignore You,  during this \nperiod— a project, of course, that soon \nlevied its own intense demands on my \ntime.\nTo compensate for these new \nconstraints, I refined my ability to work \ndeeply. Among other methods, I began to \nmore carefully block out deep work \nhours and preserve them against \nincursion. I also developed an ability to \ncarefully work through thoughts during \nthe many hours I spent on foot each week \n(a boon to my productivity), and became \nobsessive about finding disconnected \nlocations conducive to focus. During the \nsummer, for example, I would often \nwork under the dome in Barker\n\nEngineering library—a pleasingly\ncavernous location that becomes too \ncrowded when class is in session, and \nduring the winter, I sought more obscure \nlocations for some silence, eventually \ndeveloping a preference for the small \nbut well-appointed Lewis Music \nLibrary. At some point, I even bought a \n$50 high-end grid-lined lab notebook to \nwork on mathematical proofs, believing \nthat its expense would induce more care \nin my thinking.\nI ended up surprised by how well \nthis recommitment to depth ended up \nworking. After I’d taken a job as a \ncomputer science professor at \nGeorgetown University in the fall of\n\n2011, my obligations did in fact \ndrastically increase. But I had been \ntraining for this moment. Not only did I \npreserve my research productivity; it \nactually improved.  My previous rate of \ntwo good papers a year, which I \nmaintained as an unencumbered graduate \nstudent, leapt to four good papers a year, \non average, once I became a much more \nencumbered professor.\nImpressive as this was to me, \nhowever, I was soon to learn that I had \nnot yet reached the limits of what deep \nwork could produce. This lesson would \ncome during my third year as a \nprofessor. During my third year at \nGeorgetown, which spanned the fall of\n\n2013 through the summer of 2014, I \nturned my attention back to my deep \nwork habits, searching for more \nopportunities to improve. A big reason \nfor this recommitment to depth is the \nbook you’re",

A big reason \nfor this recommitment to depth is the \nbook you’re currently reading—most of \nwhich was written during this period. \nWriting a seventy-thousand-word book \nmanuscript, of course, placed a sudden \nnew constraint on my already busy \nschedule, and I wanted to make sure my \nacademic productivity didn’t take a \ncorresponding hit. Another reason I \nturned back to depth was the looming \ntenure process. I had a year or two of \npublications left before my tenure case \nwas submitted. This was the time, in\n\nother words, to make a statement about \nmy abilities (especially given that my \nwife and I were planning on growing our \nfamily with a second child in the final \nyear before tenure). The final reason I \nturned back to depth was more personal \nand (admittedly) a touch petulant. I had \napplied and been rejected for a well- \nrespected grant that many of my \ncolleagues were receiving. I was upset \nand embarrassed, so I decided that \ninstead of just complaining or \nwallowing in self-doubt, I would \ncompensate for losing the grant by \nincreasing the rate and impressiveness \nof my publications—allowing them to \ndeclare on my behalf that I actually did\n\nknow what I was doing, even if this one \nparticular grant application didn’t go my \nway.\nI was already an adept deep worker, \nbut these three forces drove me to push \nthis habit to an extreme. I became \nruthless in turning down time-consuming \ncommitments and began to work more in \nisolated locations outside my office. I \nplaced a tally of my deep work hours in \na prominent position near my desk and \ngot upset when it failed to grow at a fast \nenough rate. Perhaps most impactful, I \nreturned to my MIT habit of working on \nproblems in my head whenever a good \ntime presented itself—be it walking the \ndog or commuting. Whereas earlier, I\n\ntended to increase my deep work only as \na deadline approached, this year I was \nrelentless—most every day of most \nevery week I was pushing my mind to \ngrapple with results of consequence, \nregardless of whether or not a",

I was upset \nand embarrassed, so I decided that \ninstead of just complaining or \nwallowing in self-doubt, I would \ncompensate for losing the grant by \nincreasing the rate and impressiveness \nof my publications—allowing them to \ndeclare on my behalf that I actually did\n\nknow what I was doing, even if this one \nparticular grant application didn’t go my \nway.\nI was already an adept deep worker, \nbut these three forces drove me to push \nthis habit to an extreme. I became \nruthless in turning down time-consuming \ncommitments and began to work more in \nisolated locations outside my office. I \nplaced a tally of my deep work hours in \na prominent position near my desk and \ngot upset when it failed to grow at a fast \nenough rate.

    "text": " specific \ndeadline was near. I solved proofs on \nsubway rides and while shoveling snow. \nWhen my son napped on the weekend, I \nwould pace the yard thinking, and when \nstuck in traffic I would methodically \nwork through problems that were \nstymieing me.\nAs this year progressed, I became a \ndeep work machine—and the result of \nthis transformation caught me off guard. \nDuring the same year that I wrote a book\n\nand my oldest son entered the terrible \ntwos, I managed to more than double my \naverage academic productivity, \npublishing nine peer-reviewed papers— \nall the while maintaining my prohibition \non work in the evenings.\nI’m the first to admit that my year of \nextreme depth was perhaps a bit too \nextreme: It proved cognitively\nexhausting, and going forward I’ll likely \nmoderate this intensity. But this \nexperience reinforces the point that \nopened this conclusion: Deep work is \nway more  powerful than most people \nunderstand. It’s a commitment to this \nskill that allowed Bill Gates to make the\n\nmost of an unexpected opportunity to \ncreate a new industry, and that allowed \nme to double my academic productivity \nthe same year I decided to concurrently \nwrite a book. To leave the distracted \nmasses to join the focused few, I’m \narguing, is a transformative experience.\nThe deep life, of course, is not for \neverybody. It requires hard work and \ndrastic changes to your habits. For many, \nthere’s a comfort in the artificial \nbusyness of rapid e-mail messaging and \nsocial media posturing, while the deep \nlife demands that you leave much of that \nbehind. There’s also an uneasiness that \nsurrounds any effort to produce the best \nthings you’re capable of producing, as\n\nthis forces you to confront the possibility \nthat your best is not (yet) that good. It’s \nsafer to comment on our culture than to \nstep into the Rooseveltian ring and \nattempt to wrestle it into something \nbetter.\nBut if you’re willing to sidestep \nthese comforts and fears, and instead \nstruggle to deploy your mind to its fullest \ncapacity to create things that matter, then \nyou’ll discover, as others have before \nyou, that depth generates a life rich with \nproductivity and meaning. In Part 1, I \nquoted writer Winifred Gallagher \nsaying, “I’ll live the focused life, \nbecause it’s the best kind there is.” I \nagree. So does Bill Gates. And\n\nhopefully now that you’ve finished this \nbook, you agree too.",

I solved proofs on \nsubway rides and while shoveling snow. \nWhen my son napped on the weekend, I \nwould pace the yard thinking, and when \nstuck in traffic I would methodically \nwork through problems that were \nstymieing me.\nAs this year progressed, I became a \ndeep work machine—and the result of \nthis transformation caught me off guard. \nDuring the same year that I wrote a book\n\nand my oldest son entered the terrible \ntwos, I managed to more than double my \naverage academic productivity, \npublishing nine peer-reviewed papers— \nall the while maintaining my prohibition \non work in the evenings.\nI’m the first to admit that my year of \nextreme depth was perhaps a bit too \nextreme: It proved cognitively\nexhausting, and going forward I’ll likely \nmoderate this intensity. But this \nexperience reinforces the point that \nopened this conclusion: Deep work is \nway more  powerful than most people \nunderstand. It’s a commitment to this \nskill that allowed Bill Gates to make the\n\nmost of an unexpected opportunity to \ncreate a new industry, and that allowed \nme to double my academic productivity \nthe same year I decided to concurrently \nwrite a book. To leave the distracted \nmasses to join the focused few, I’m \narguing, is a transformative experience.\nThe deep life, of course, is not for \neverybody. It requires hard work and \ndrastic changes to your habits. For many, \nthere’s a comfort in the artificial \nbusyness of rapid e-mail messaging and \nsocial media posturing, while the deep \nlife demands that you leave much of that \nbehind. There’s also an uneasiness that \nsurrounds any effort to produce the best \nthings you’re capable of producing, as\n\nthis forces you to confront the possibility \nthat your best is not (yet) that good. It’s \nsafer to comment on our culture than to \nstep into the Rooseveltian ring and \nattempt to wrestle it into something \nbetter.\nBut if you’re willing to sidestep \nthese comforts and fears, and instead \nstruggle to deploy your mind to its fullest \ncapacity to create things that matter, then \nyou’ll discover, as others have before \nyou, that depth generates a life rich with \nproductivity and meaning.
