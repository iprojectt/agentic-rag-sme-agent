It is expected that a person’s awareness of the monochronic/polychronicside of personal time style affects his or her overall approach to time use, perceptionsof time pressure and the amounts and order of time spent on tasks.  This, in turn,affects his or her personal efficiency. \nMonochronic approach to time management is essentially objective and lays empha-\nsis on promptness, speed, brevity and punctuality. It is a very efficient and focusedway to manage work and life. Monochronic time managers are those who thrive ondetailed planning and organization. They prefer to focus on one task at a time and theyfollow a schedule from which they don’t like to deviate. They tend to get upset by dis-tractions or interruptions and are inclined to put new tasks off until a later date, whenthey can be worked into the schedule.\nPolychronic approach to time management is subjective and lays emphasis on\ninspiration, imagination, flexibility, intuition and dedication. Trust, bonding, pleasureand quality of life influence more strongly the decisions of a person who ‘ticks’ inpolychronic time. Polychronic time managers prefer to have many projects under waysimultaneously, enjoy changing from activity to activity and are unflustered bydistractions and interruptions. Unlike their monochronic counterparts, polychronicmanagers believe they perform well under pressure.\nHandbook on Time Management Skills\n11Clearly, monochronic approach is better suited for dealing with routine and predictable\ntasks, while polychronic approach is better suited in dealing with things such as creating a\nnew concept or resolving an argument. Conflict arises when managers apply a monchronic\nstyle to a situation that demands polychronic time, or managers prefer polychronic stylewhile the situation warrants the use of monchronic style.\nSo how do the managers cope with a healthy need for subjective, polychronic, self-imposed\ntime and at the same time fit in with the monochronic and objective time measures? The\nonly way managers can figure out which method works best in a given situation is based\non sound reasoning and acumen.\nHow can you get an extra hour out of each day?\nHere are some tips to help you squeeze those extra minutes out of your day. Of course,\nyou can adapt these so that they will fit in with your situation.\n1. Get up earlier2. Watch less TV (I mean how many Law & Order spinoffs does one need to\n    watch?)\n3. Avoid allowing others to waste your time4. If you don’t have to drive to work, use that time to study or plan. If you do\n    drive to work listen to a motivational tape on the way to work instead of\n    that mindless dj talk.\n5. Organize your work; do it systematically.\n6. Make creative use of lunchtime.7. Delegate authority if, possible.\n8. Spend less time on unimportant phone calls.\n9. Think first, and then do the task.10. Do what you dream about doing, instead of just dreaming about it.\n11. Work hardest when you’re the most mentally alert\n12. Eliminate activities that make the smallest contributions to your life.13. Always do the toughest jobs first.\n14. Before each major act ask, “Is this really necessary?”\n15. Choose interesting and constructive literature for spare time reading.16. Learn how to sleep. Sleep soundly, then work refreshed.\nSoft Skills for Public Managers\n1217. Skip desserts.\n18. Stop smoking.\n19. Write notes or letters while waiting for others.20.

It is expected that a person’s awareness of the monochronic/polychronicside of personal time style affects his or her overall approach to time use, perceptionsof time pressure and the amounts and order of time spent on tasks.  This, in turn,affects his or her personal efficiency. \nMonochronic approach to time management is essentially objective and lays empha-\nsis on promptness, speed, brevity and punctuality. It is a very efficient and focusedway to manage work and life. Monochronic time managers are those who thrive ondetailed planning and organization. They prefer to focus on one task at a time and theyfollow a schedule from which they don’t like to deviate. They tend to get upset by dis-tractions or interruptions and are inclined to put new tasks off until a later date, whenthey can be worked into the schedule.\nPolychronic approach to time management is subjective and lays emphasis on\ninspiration, imagination, flexibility, intuition and dedication. Trust, bonding, pleasureand quality of life influence more strongly the decisions of a person who ‘ticks’ inpolychronic time. Polychronic time managers prefer to have many projects under waysimultaneously, enjoy changing from activity to activity and are unflustered bydistractions and interruptions. Unlike their monochronic counterparts, polychronicmanagers believe they perform well under pressure.\nHandbook on Time Management Skills\n11Clearly, monochronic approach is",

Unlike their monochronic counterparts, polychronicmanagers believe they perform well under pressure.\nHandbook on Time Management Skills\n11Clearly, monochronic approach is better suited for dealing with routine and predictable\ntasks, while polychronic approach is better suited in dealing with things such as creating a\nnew concept or resolving an argument. Conflict arises when managers apply a monchronic\nstyle to a situation that demands polychronic time, or managers prefer polychronic stylewhile the situation warrants the use of monchronic style.\nSo how do the managers cope with a healthy need for subjective, polychronic, self-imposed\ntime and at the same time fit in with the monochronic and objective time measures? The\nonly way managers can figure out which method works best in a given situation is based\non sound reasoning and acumen.\nHow can you get an extra hour out of each day?\nHere are some tips to help you squeeze those extra minutes out of your day. Of course,\nyou can adapt these so that they will fit in with your situation.\n1. Get up earlier2. Watch less TV (I mean how many Law & Order spinoffs does",

Watch less TV (I mean how many Law & Order spinoffs does one need to\n    watch?)\n3. Avoid allowing others to waste your time4. If you don’t have to drive to work, use that time to study or plan. If you do\n    drive to work listen to a motivational tape on the way to work instead of\n    that mindless dj talk.\n5. Organize your work; do it systematically.\n6. Make creative use of lunchtime.7. Delegate authority if, possible.\n8. Spend less time on unimportant phone calls.\n9. Think first, and then do the task.10. Do what you dream about doing, instead of just dreaming about it.\n11. Work hardest when you’re the most mentally alert\n12. Eliminate activities that make the smallest contributions to your life.13. Always do the toughest jobs first.\n14. Before each major act ask, “Is this really necessary?”\n15. Choose interesting and constructive literature for spare time reading.16. Learn how to sleep. Sleep soundly, then work refreshed",

However,\n      it is necessary to make sacrifices so that your business can be successful.\nDon’t try to implement all of these ideas at once. Implement them one at a time and\nrepeat them until they become a part of your daily routine.\nSource: http://EzineArticles.com/?expert=DeAnna_Spencer\nHandbook on Time Management Skills\n137  The ‘Five Time Zone’ Concept\nTo accelerate the ability to manage their time, managers need to strike a proper balance\nbetween monochronic and polychronic aspects of time management.   The ‘Five TimeZone Concept’ advocated by Lewis, Justus and Storz, Moni Laui (Switch on Your Mind:\nAccelerative Learning Strategies at Work.) enables managers to bring about that balance.\nThe five links in the ‘Five Time Zone’ approach are - vision, plans, personal organisationsystems, commitment and energy.\n•Developing Zone 1 - Vision and Goals:  Managers must search for visions, not\ntasks. These visions are guided by their personal standards and values, and the\ndirection they want to take. Once their visions are crystallized, they need to dosome thinking to create goals from their visions and action steps from their goals.\nMy vision and goals . . .\n• What is most important to me?\n•  What would I like to do if there were no limitations?•  What things in my life would I like to be different?\n•  My visions for myself are . . .\n•Developing Zone 2 - Plans:  Having established goals, managers now can move\ninto zone two - plans. A plan is needed to turn visions and goals into action. Writingthings down and using some form of planning ‘tool’ are keys to successful planning.\nOnce they have drawn up the plan, they need to review it. They should plan for high-\npayoff and low-payoff activities for high and low priorities.\n•Developing Zone 3 – Personal Organization Systems (POS):  Zone three\nencompasses a manager’s personal organisation system. Organising the desk,follow-up, paperwork, physical environment are all part of personal organization\nsystem. The personal organization system should focus on –\n• Creating an interesting and relaxing work-space\n• Providing easy access to basic tools and materials\n• Grouping similar tasks together to optimize time\nSoft Skills for Public Managers\n14• Devising a good follow-up system that works well\n• Enabling efficient handling of each piece of paper• Ensuring a wider reach of people\nMy action plan to develop my POS\n12\n3\n45\n•Developing Zone 4 – Commitment:  The fourth time zone is the zone of\ncommitment, in which managers correct any tendencies they might have towardsprocrastination. Procrastination can be overcome by identifying why one is\nprocrastinating, breaking the mental blocks and visualizing the successful completion\nof a task while in a relaxed state. One way to do this it to identify the real reason forthe procrastination - personal, logical, emotional or ethical barrier to action. Once\nthis has surfaced from the subconscious to the conscious, strategies can be brought\ninto play to deal with it.\nReasons why I procrastinate . . .\n1\n2\n34\n5\n•Developing Zone 5 – Energy:  The final factor that keeps the chain together is\nzone five, the energy zone. Managers must check their office surroundings, as the\nenvironment they work in can sap or strengthen their energy levels. They must alsoidentify the prime time - the time of day when they are most energetic and alert –\nthey can schedule high-priority, high-payoff tasks or activities for these times.\n• Find your prime time• Internal and external prime time\n• Cognitive tasks for the morning\n• Complete high-energy tasks in high-energy periods• Take energy breaks\nHandbook on Time Management Skills\n15Tasks can be categorized as urgent/ not urgent or as important/ not important as shown\nbelow.  Each of a manager’s activities can be distinguished as one of four types,\nrepresented by the four quadrants of the time management matrix. Categorizing a\nmanager’s activities in these quadrants helps him identify what is important and avoidunimportant tasks and activities. It also helps him prioritize important tasks and activities.Not\nImportantQuadrant   I\nCrises, Projects,\naccidents,",

The ‘Five TimeZone Concept’ advocated by Lewis, Justus and Storz, Moni Laui (Switch on Your Mind:\nAccelerative Learning Strategies at Work.) enables managers to bring about that balance.\nThe five links in the ‘Five Time Zone’ approach are - vision, plans, personal organisationsystems, commitment and energy.\n•Developing Zone 1 - Vision and Goals:  Managers must search for visions, not\ntasks. These visions are guided by their personal standards and values, and the\ndirection they want to take. Once their visions are crystallized, they need to dosome thinking to create goals from their visions and action steps from their goals.\nMy vision and goals . . .\n• What is most important to me?\n•  What would I like to do if there were no limitations?•  What things in my life would I like to be different?\n•  My visions for myself are . . .\n•Developing Zone 2 - Plans:  Having established goals, managers now can move\ninto zone two - plans. A plan is needed to turn visions and goals into action. Writingthings down and using some form of planning ‘tool’ are keys to successful planning.\nOnce they have drawn up the plan, they need to review it. They should plan for high-\npayoff and low-payoff activities for high and low",

The ‘Five TimeZone Concept’ advocated by Lewis, Justus and Storz, Moni Laui (Switch on Your Mind:\nAccelerative Learning Strategies at Work.) enables managers to bring about that balance.\nThe five links in the ‘Five Time Zone’ approach are - vision, plans, personal organisationsystems, commitment and energy.\n•Developing Zone 1 - Vision and Goals:  Managers must search for visions, not\ntasks. These visions are guided by their personal standards and values, and the\ndirection they want to take. Once their visions are crystallized, they need to dosome thinking to create goals from their visions and action steps from their goals.\nMy vision and goals . . .\n• What is most important to me?\n•  What would I like to do if there were no limitations?•  What things in my life would I like to be different?\n•  My visions for myself are . . .\n•Developing Zone 2 - Plans:  Having established goals, managers now can move\ninto zone two - plans. A plan is needed to turn visions and goals into action",

These include deadline-driven tasks\nand important daily chores. The results of operating in this Quadrant are stress, burnout andcrisis management\nNot\nImportantImportantUrgent Not Urgent\nQuadrant  I Quadrant  II\nQuadrant  III Quadrant  IVQ2 : Calm and in controlQ1 : Sruggling to stay ahead\nNot\nImportantImportantUrgent Not Urgent\nQuadrant  I Quadrant  II\nQuadrant  III Quadrant  IV\n\nHandbook on Time Management Skills\n17The activities in Quadrant 2 are important but not urgent. These activities are characterized\nas preparation, planning, crisis prevention, and deadline-avoiding tasks. Operating in this\nQuadrant will mean a manager having a proper perspective, vision, balance, discipline,control and few crises.\nThe activities in Quadrant 3 are not important but urgently press upon us and interrupt our more\nimportant activities. These include responding to drop-in visitors, phone calls, meetings, andmail that do not increase productivity and effectiveness. Operating in this Quadrant will meanshort-term focus, crisis management, worthlessness of goals and plans, feeling of victimiza-\ntion and broken relationships.Q3 : Busy going nowhere\nNot\nImportantImportantUrgent Not Urgent\nQuadrant  I Quadrant  II\nQuadrant  III Quadrant  IV\nSoft Skills for Public Managers\n18The activities in Quadrant 4 are neither important nor urgent. Busywork, time wasters, junk\nmail, and some phone calls are the type of activities that are a part of this quadrant.\nOperating in this Quadrant will mean total irresponsibility and over-dependence on others\nin addition to outcomes in Quadrant 3.\nFrom a study of the Time Management Matrix, the following observations can be made:\n1. Activities in Quadrant I and Quadrant II may be equally important. Some activities in\nQuadrant II may even be more important than activities in Quadrant I, but not\nnecessarily more urgent.\n2. Activities in Quadrant I assume critical importance and top priority.\n3. Spending most of the time on Activities in Quadrant I results in stress and burnout.\n4. Focusing on activities in Quadrant II can reduce the activities in Quadrant I, in the long\nrun.\n5. Focusing on activities in Quadrant II will mean avoiding all unimportant activities in\nQuadrant III and IV.Q4 : Aspiring to mediocrity\nNot\nImportantImportantUrgent Not Urgent\nQuadrant  I Quadrant  II\nQuadrant  III Quadrant  IV",

These include deadline-driven tasks\nand important daily chores. The results of operating in this Quadrant are stress, burnout andcrisis management\nNot\nImportantImportantUrgent Not Urgent\nQuadrant  I Quadrant  II\nQuadrant  III Quadrant  IVQ2 : Calm and in controlQ1 : Sruggling to stay ahead\nNot\nImportantImportantUrgent Not Urgent\nQuadrant  I Quadrant  II\nQuadrant  III Quadrant  IV\n\nHandbook on Time Management Skills\n17The activities in Quadrant 2 are important but not urgent. These activities are characterized\nas preparation, planning, crisis prevention, and deadline-avoiding tasks. Operating in this\nQuadrant will mean a manager having a proper perspective, vision, balance, discipline,control and few crises.\nThe activities in Quadrant 3 are not important but urgently press upon us and interrupt our more\nimportant activities. These include responding to drop-in visitors, phone calls, meetings, andmail that do not increase productivity and effectiveness. Operating in this Quadrant will meanshort-term focus, crisis management, worthlessness of goals and plans, feeling of victimiza-\ntion and broken relationships.Q3 : Busy going nowhere\nNot\nImportantImportantUrgent Not Urgent\nQuadrant  I Quadrant  II\nQuadrant  III Quadrant  IV\nSoft Skills for Public Managers\n18The activities in Quadrant 4 are neither important nor urgent",

Busywork, time wasters, junk\nmail, and some phone calls are the type of activities that are a part of this quadrant.\nOperating in this Quadrant will mean total irresponsibility and over-dependence on others\nin addition to outcomes in Quadrant 3.\nFrom a study of the Time Management Matrix, the following observations can be made:\n1. Activities in Quadrant I and Quadrant II may be equally important. Some activities in\nQuadrant II may even be more important than activities in Quadrant I, but not\nnecessarily more urgent.\n2. Activities in Quadrant I assume critical importance and top priority.\n3. Spending most of the time on Activities in Quadrant I results in stress and burnout.\n4. Focusing on activities in Quadrant II can reduce the activities in Quadrant I, in the long\nrun.\n5. Focusing on activities in Quadrant II will mean avoiding all unimportant activities in\nQuadrant III and IV.Q4 : Aspiring to mediocrity\nNot\nImportantImportantUrgent Not Urgent\nQuadrant  I Quadrant  II\nQuadrant  III Quadrant  IV",

Busywork, time wasters, junk\nmail, and some phone calls are the type of activities that are a part of this quadrant.\nOperating in this Quadrant will mean total irresponsibility and over-dependence on others\nin addition to outcomes in Quadrant 3.\nFrom a study of the Time Management Matrix, the following observations can be made:\n1. Activities in Quadrant I and Quadrant II may be equally important. Some activities in\nQuadrant II may even be more important than activities in Quadrant I, but not\nnecessarily more urgent.\n2. Activities in Quadrant I assume critical importance and top priority.\n3. Spending most of the time on Activities in Quadrant I results in stress and burnout.\n4. Focusing on activities in Quadrant II can reduce the activities in Quadrant I, in the long\nrun.\n5. Focusing on activities in Quadrant II will mean avoiding all unimportant activities in\nQuadrant III and IV.Q4 : Aspiring",
