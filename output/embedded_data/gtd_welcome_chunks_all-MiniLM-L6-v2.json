    "text": "Welcome to Getting Things Done \nWELCOME TO A gold mine of insights into strategies for how to have \nmore energy, be more relaxed, and get a lot more ac complished \nwith much less effort. If you're like me, you like getting things \ndone and doing them well, and yet you also want to savor life in \nways that seem increasingly elusive if not downrigh t impossible if \nyou're working too hard. This doesn't have to be an  either-or \nproposition. It is possible to be effectively doing while you are \ndelightfully being, in your ordinary workaday world. \nI think efficiency is a good thing. Maybe what you' re doing is \nimportant, interesting, or useful; or maybe it isn' t but it has to be \ndone anyway. In the first case you want to get as m uch return as \nyou can on your investment of time and energy. In \nthe second, you want to get on to other things as f ast \nas you can, without any nagging loose ends. \nAnd whatever you're doing, you'd probably like to \nbe more relaxed, confident that whatever you're doi ng \nat the moment is just what you need to be doing—tha t \nhaving a beer with your staff after hours, gazing a t your \nsleeping child in his or her crib at midnight, answ ering \nthe e-mail in front of you, or spending a few infor mal \nminutes with the potential new client after the mee ting \nis exactly what you ought to be doing, as you're doing it. \nTeaching you how to be maximally efficient and \nrelaxed, whenever you need or want to be, was my ma in purpose \nin writing this book. \nxi The art of resting \nthe mind and the \npower of \ndismissing from it \nall care and worry \nis probably one of \nthe secrets of our \ngreat men. \n—Captain]. \nA. \nxiiWELCOME TO GETTING THINGS DONE \nI have searched for a long time, as you may have, f or answers \nto the questions of what to do, when to do it, and how to do it. \nAnd after twenty-plus years of developing and apply ing new \nmethods for personal and organizational productivit y, alongside \nyears of rigorous exploration in the self-developme nt arena, I can \nattest that there is no single, once-and-for-all so lution. No soft- \nware, seminar, cool personal planner, or personal m ission state- \nment will simplify your workday or make your choice s for you as \nyou move through your day, week, and life. What's m ore, just \nwhen you learn how to enhance your productivity and  decision- \nmaking at one level, you'll graduate to the next ac cepted batch of \nresponsibilities and creative goals, whose new chal lenges will defy \nthe ability of any simple formula or buzzword-du-jo ur to get you \nwhat you want, the way you want to get it. \nBut if there's no single means of perfecting person al organi- \nzation and productivity, there are things we can do to facilitate \nthem. As I have personally matured, from year to ye ar, I've found \ndeeper and more meaningful, more significant things  to focus on \nand be aware of and do. And I've uncovered simple p rocesses that \nwe can all learn to use that will vastly improve ou r ability to deal \nproactively and constructively with the mundane rea lities of the \nworld. \nWhat follows is a compilation of more than two deca des'\nworth of discoveries about personal productivity—a guide to \nmaximizing output and minimizing input, and to doin g so in a \nworld in which work is increasingly voluminous and ambiguous. I \nhave spent many thousands of hours coaching people \"in the \ntrenches\" at their desks, helping them process and organize all of \ntheir work at hand. The methods I have uncovered ha ve proved to \nbe highly effective in all types of organizations, at every job level, \nacross cultures, and even at home and school. After  twenty years \nof coaching and training some of the world's most s ophisticated \nand productive professionals, I know the world is h ungry for these \nmethods. \nExecutives at the top are looking to instill \"ruthl ess execu- \nWELCOME TO GETTING THINGS DONE \ntion\" in themselves and their people as a basic sta ndard. They \nknow, and I know, that behind closed doors, after h ours, there \nremain unanswered calls, tasks to be delegated, unp rocessed issues \nfrom meetings and conversations, personal responsib ilities \nunmanaged, and dozens of e-mails still not dealt wi th.

If you're like me, you like getting things \ndone and doing them well, and yet you also want to savor life in \nways that seem increasingly elusive if not downrigh t impossible if \nyou're working too hard. This doesn't have to be an  either-or \nproposition. It is possible to be effectively doing while you are \ndelightfully being, in your ordinary workaday world. \nI think efficiency is a good thing. Maybe what you' re doing is \nimportant, interesting, or useful; or maybe it isn' t but it has to be \ndone anyway. In the first case you want to get as m uch return as \nyou can on your investment of time and energy. In \nthe second, you want to get on to other things as f ast \nas you can, without any nagging loose ends. \nAnd whatever you're doing, you'd probably like to \nbe more relaxed, confident that whatever you're doi ng \nat the moment is just what you need to be doing—tha t \nhaving a beer with your staff after hours, gazing a t your \nsleeping child in his or her crib at midnight, answ ering \nthe e-mail in front of you, or spending a few infor mal \nminutes with the potential new client after the mee ting \nis exactly what you ought to be doing, as you're doing it. \nTeaching you how to be maximally efficient and \nrelaxed, whenever you need or want to be, was my ma in purpose \nin writing this book. \nxi The art of resting \nthe mind and the \npower of \ndismissing from it \nall care and worry \nis probably one of \nthe secrets of our \ngreat men. \n—Captain]. \nA. \nxiiWELCOME TO GETTING THINGS DONE \nI have searched for a long time, as you may have, f or answers \nto the questions of what to do, when to do it, and how to do it. \nAnd after twenty-plus years of developing and apply ing new \nmethods for personal and organizational productivit y, alongside \nyears of rigorous exploration in the self-developme nt arena, I can \nattest that there is no single, once-and-for-all so",

    "text": " twenty-plus years of developing and apply ing new \nmethods for personal and organizational productivit y, alongside \nyears of rigorous exploration in the self-developme nt arena, I can \nattest that there is no single, once-and-for-all so lution. No soft- \nware, seminar, cool personal planner, or personal m ission state- \nment will simplify your workday or make your choice s for you as \nyou move through your day, week, and life. What's m ore, just \nwhen you learn how to enhance your productivity and  decision- \nmaking at one level, you'll graduate to the next ac cepted batch of \nresponsibilities and creative goals, whose new chal lenges will defy \nthe ability of any simple formula or buzzword-du-jo ur to get you \nwhat you want, the way you want to get it. \nBut if there's no single means of perfecting person al organi- \nzation and productivity, there are things we can do to facilitate \nthem. As I have personally matured, from year to ye ar, I've found \ndeeper and more meaningful, more significant things  to focus on \nand be aware of and do. And I've uncovered simple p rocesses that \nwe can all learn to use that will vastly improve ou r ability to deal \nproactively and constructively with the mundane rea lities of the \nworld. \nWhat follows is a compilation of more than two deca des'\nworth of discoveries about personal productivity—a guide to \nmaximizing output and minimizing input, and to doin g so in a \nworld in which work is increasingly voluminous and ambiguous. I \nhave spent many thousands of hours coaching people \"in the \ntrenches\" at their desks, helping them process and organize all of \ntheir work at hand. The methods I have uncovered ha ve proved to \nbe highly effective in all types of organizations, at every job level, \nacross cultures, and even at home and school. After  twenty years \nof coaching and training some of the world's most s ophisticated \nand productive professionals, I know the world is h ungry for these \nmethods. \nExecutives at the top are looking to instill \"ruthl ess execu- \nWELCOME TO GETTING THINGS DONE \ntion\" in themselves and their people as a basic sta ndard. They \nknow, and I know, that behind closed",

And I've uncovered simple p rocesses that \nwe can all learn to use that will vastly improve ou r ability to deal \nproactively and constructively with the mundane rea lities of the \nworld. \nWhat follows is a compilation of more than two deca des'\nworth of discoveries about personal productivity—a guide to \nmaximizing output and minimizing input, and to doin g so in a \nworld in which work is increasingly voluminous and ambiguous. I \nhave spent many thousands of hours coaching people \"in the \ntrenches\" at their desks, helping them process and organize all of \ntheir work at hand. The methods I have uncovered ha ve proved to \nbe highly effective in all types of organizations, at every job level, \nacross cultures, and even at home and school. After  twenty years \nof coaching and training some of the world's most s ophisticated \nand productive professionals, I know the world is h ungry for these \nmethods. \nExecutives at",

    "text": " doors, after h ours, there \nremain unanswered calls, tasks to be delegated, unp rocessed issues \nfrom meetings and conversations, personal responsib ilities \nunmanaged, and dozens of e-mails still not dealt wi th. Many of \nthese businesspeople are successful because the cri ses they solve \nand the opportunities they take advantage of are bi gger than the \nproblems they allow and create in their own offices  and briefcases. \nBut given the pace of business and life today, the equation is in \nquestion. \nOn the one hand, we need proven tools that can help  people \nfocus their energies strategically and tactically w ithout letting \nanything fall through the cracks. On the other, we need to create \nwork environments and skills that will keep the mos t invested \npeople from burning out due to stress. We need posi tive work- \nstyle standards that will attract and retain the be st and brightest. \nWe know this information is sorely needed in organi zations. \nIt's also needed in schools, where our kids are sti ll not being \ntaught how to process information, how to focus on outcomes, or \nwhat actions to take to make them happen. And for a ll of us indi- \nvidually, it's needed so we can take advantage of a ll the opportuni- \nties we're given to add value to our world in a sus tainable, \nself-nurturing way. \nThe power, simplicity, and effectiveness of what I' m talking about \nin Getting Things Done are best experienced as experiences, in real \ntime, with real situations in your real world. Nece ssarily, the book \nmust put the essence of this dynamic art of workflo w manage- \nment and personal productivity into a linear format . I've tried \nto organize it in such a way as to give you both th e inspiring big- \npicture view and a taste of immediate results as yo u go along. \nThe book is divided into three parts. Part 1 descri bes the \nwhole game, providing a brief overview of the syste m and an \nexplanation of why it's unique and timely, and then  presenting the \nbasic methodologies themselves in their most conden sed and \nxiii \nxiv WELCOME TO GETTING THINGS DONE \nbasic form. Part 2 shows you how to implement the s ystem. \nIt's your personal coaching, step by step, on the n itty-gritty appli- \ncation of the models. Part 3 goes even deeper, desc ribing the \nsubtler and more profound results you can expect wh en you incor- \nporate the methodologies and models into your work and your \nlife. \nI want you to hop in. I want you to test this stuff  out, even \nchallenge it. I want you to find out for yourself t hat what I prom- \nise is not only possible but instantly accessible t o you personally. \nAnd I want you to know that everything I propose is  easy to do. It \ninvolves no new skills at all. You already know how  to focus, how \nto write things down, how to decide on outcomes and  actions, and \nhow to review options and make choices. You'll vali date that \nmany of the things you've been doing instinctively and intuitively \nall along are right. I'll give you ways to leverage those basic skills \ninto new plateaus of effectiveness. I want to inspi re you to put all \nthis into a new behavior set that will blow your mi nd. \nThroughout the book I refer to my coaching and semi nars \non this material. I've worked as a \"management cons ultant\" for \nthe last two decades, alone and in small partnershi ps. My work \nhas consisted primarily of doing private productivi ty coaching \nand conducting seminars based on the methods presen ted here. I \n(and my colleagues) have coached more than a thousa nd indi- \nviduals, trained hundreds of thousands of professio nals, and deliv- \nered many hundreds of public seminars; This is the background \nfrom which I have drawn my experience and examples.\nThe promise here was well described by a client of mine who \nwrote, \"When I habitually applied the tenets of thi s program it \nsaved my life . . . when I faithfully applied them, it changed my life. \nThis is a vaccination against day-to-day fire-fight ing (the so- \ncalled urgent and crisis demands of any given workd ay) and an \nantidote for the imbalance many people bring upon t hemselves.\"",

    "text": " most conden sed and \nxiii \nxiv WELCOME TO GETTING THINGS DONE \nbasic form. Part 2 shows you how to implement the s ystem. \nIt's your personal coaching, step by step, on the n itty-gritty appli- \ncation of the models. Part 3 goes even deeper, desc ribing the \nsubtler and more profound results you can expect wh en you incor- \nporate the methodologies and models into your work and your \nlife. \nI want you to hop in. I want you to test this stuff  out, even \nchallenge it. I want you to find out for yourself t hat what I prom- \nise is not only possible but instantly accessible t o you personally. \nAnd I want you to know that everything I propose is  easy to do. It \ninvolves no new skills at all. You already know how  to focus, how \nto write things down, how to decide on outcomes and  actions, and \nhow to review options and make choices. You'll vali date that \nmany of the things you've been doing instinctively and intuitively \nall along are right. I'll give you ways to leverage those basic skills \ninto new plateaus of effectiveness. I want to inspi re you to put all \nthis into a new behavior set that will blow your mi nd. \nThroughout the book I refer to my coaching and semi nars \non this material. I've worked as a \"management cons ultant\" for \nthe last two decades, alone and in small partnershi ps. My work \nhas consisted primarily of doing private productivi ty coaching \nand conducting seminars based on the methods presen ted here. I \n(and my colleagues) have coached more than a thousa nd indi- \nviduals, trained hundreds of thousands of professio nals, and deliv- \nered many hundreds of public seminars; This is the background \nfrom which I have drawn my experience and examples.\nThe promise here was well described by a client of mine who \nwrote, \"When I habitually applied the tenets of thi s program it \nsaved my life . . . when I faithfully applied them, it changed my life. \nThis is a vaccination against day-to-day fire-fight ing (the so- \ncalled urgent and crisis demands of any given workd ay) and an \nantidote for the imbalance many people bring upon t hemselves.\"",
