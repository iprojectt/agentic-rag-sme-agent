Hopkins was approached by an old friend with a new business idea. The friend had discovered an amazing product, he explained, that he was convinced would be a hit. It was a toothpaste, a minty, frothy concoction he called “Pepsodent.” There were some dicey investors  involved— one of them had a string of busted land deals; another, it  was rumored, was connected to the  mob— but this venture, the friend promised, was going to be huge. If, that is, Hop-kins would consent to help design a national promotional cam-paign.\nHopkins, at the time, was at the top of a booming industry that \nhad hardly existed a few decades earlier: advertising. Hopkins was the man who had convinced Americans to buy Schlitz beer by boast-ing that the company cleaned their bottles “with live steam,” while neglecting to mention that every other company used the exact same method. He had seduced millions of women into purchasing Pal-\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   31 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   31 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n32 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nmolive soap by proclaiming that Cleopatra had washed with it, de-\nspite the sputtering protests of outraged historians. He had made Puffed Wheat famous by saying that it was “shot from guns” until the grains puffed “to eight times normal size.” He had turned doz-ens of previously unknown  products— Quaker Oats, Goodyear tires, the Bissell carpet sweeper, Van Camp’s pork and  beans— into house-hold names. And in the process, he had made himself so rich that his  best- selling autobiography, My Life in Advertising,  devoted long \npassages to the difﬁ  culties of spending so much money.\nHowever, Claude Hopkins was best known for a series of rules \nhe coined explaining how to create new habits among consumers. These rules would transform industries and eventually became con-ventional wisdom among marketers, educational reformers, public health professionals, politicians, and CEOs. Even today, Hopkins’s rules inﬂ  uence everything from how we buy cleaning supplies to \nthe tools governments use for eradicating disease. They are funda-mental to creating any new routine.\nHowever, when his old friend approached Hopkins about Pepso-\ndent, the ad man expressed only mild interest. It was no secret that the health of Americans’ teeth was in steep decline. As the nation had become wealthier, people had started buying larger amounts of sugary, processed foods. When the government started drafting men for World War I, so many recruits had rotting teeth that ofﬁ  -\ncials said poor dental hygiene was a national security risk.\nYet as Hopkins knew, selling toothpaste was ﬁ  nancial suicide. \nThere was already an army of  door- to- door salesmen hawking dubi-ous tooth powders and elixirs, most of them going broke.\nThe problem was that hardly anyone bought toothpaste because, \ndespite the nation ’s dental problems, hardly anyone brushed their teeth.\nSo Hopkins gave his friend’s proposal a bit of thought, and then \ndeclined. He’d stick with soaps and cereals, he said. “I did not see a way to educate the laity in technical  tooth- paste theories,” Hopkins \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   32 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   32 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Craving Brain ● 33\nexplained in his autobiography. The friend, however, was persistent. \nHe came back again and again, appealing to Hopkins’s considerable ego until, eventually, the ad man gave in.\n“I ﬁ nally agreed to undertake the campaign if he gave me a six \nmonths’ option on a block of stock,” Hopkins wrote. The friend agreed.\nIt would be the wisest ﬁ  nancial decision of Hopkins’s life.\nWithin ﬁ  ve years of that partnership, Hopkins turned Pepsodent \ninto one of the  best- known products on earth and, in the process, helped create a toothbrushing habit that moved across America with startling speed. Soon, everyone from Shirley Temple to Clark Gable was bragging about their “Pepsodent smile.” By 1930, Pepsodent",

Hopkins was approached by an old friend with a new business idea. The friend had discovered an amazing product, he explained, that he was convinced would be a hit. It was a toothpaste, a minty, frothy concoction he called “Pepsodent.” There were some dicey investors  involved— one of them had a string of busted land deals; another, it  was rumored, was connected to the  mob— but this venture, the friend promised, was going to be huge. If, that is, Hop-kins would consent to help design a national promotional cam-paign.\nHopkins, at the time, was at the top of a booming industry that \nhad hardly existed a few decades earlier: advertising. Hopkins was the man who had convinced Americans to buy Schlitz beer by boast-ing that the company cleaned their bottles “with live steam,” while neglecting to mention that every other company used the exact same method. He had seduced millions of women into purchasing Pal-\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   31 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   31 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n32 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nmolive soap by proclaiming that Cleopatra had washed with it, de-\nspite the sputtering protests of outraged historians. He had made Puffed Wheat famous by saying that it was “shot from guns” until the grains puffed “to eight times normal size.” He had turned doz-ens of previously unknown  products— Quaker Oats, Goodyear tires, the Bissell carpet sweeper, Van Camp’s pork and  beans— into house-hold names. And in the process, he had made himself so rich that his  best- selling autobiography, My Life in Advertising,  devoted long \npassages to the difﬁ  culties of spending so much money.\nHowever, Claude Hopkins was best known for a series of rules \nhe coined explaining how to create new habits among consumers. These rules would transform industries and eventually became con-ventional wisdom among marketers, educational reformers, public health professionals, politicians, and CEOs",

    "text": ", Claude Hopkins was best known for a series of rules \nhe coined explaining how to create new habits among consumers. These rules would transform industries and eventually became con-ventional wisdom among marketers, educational reformers, public health professionals, politicians, and CEOs. Even today, Hopkins’s rules inﬂ  uence everything from how we buy cleaning supplies to \nthe tools governments use for eradicating disease. They are funda-mental to creating any new routine.\nHowever, when his old friend approached Hopkins about Pepso-\ndent, the ad man expressed only mild interest. It was no secret that the health of Americans’ teeth was in steep decline. As the nation had become wealthier, people had started buying larger amounts of sugary, processed foods. When the government started drafting men for World War I, so many recruits had rotting teeth that ofﬁ  -\ncials said poor dental hygiene was a national security risk.\nYet as Hopkins knew, selling toothpaste was ﬁ  nancial suicide. \nThere was already an army of  door- to- door salesmen hawking dubi-ous tooth powders and elixirs, most of them going broke.\nThe problem was that hardly anyone bought toothpaste because, \ndespite the nation ’s dental problems, hardly anyone brushed their teeth.\nSo Hopkins gave his friend’s proposal a bit of thought, and then \ndeclined. He’d stick with soaps and cereals, he said. “I did not see a way to educate the laity in technical  tooth- paste theories,” Hopkins \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   32 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   32 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Craving Brain ● 33\nexplained in his autobiography. The friend, however, was persistent. \nHe came back again and again, appealing to Hopkins’s considerable ego until, eventually, the ad man gave in.\n“I ﬁ nally agreed to undertake the campaign if he gave me a six \nmonths’ option on a block of stock,” Hopkins wrote. The friend agreed.\nIt would be the wisest ﬁ  nancial decision of Hopkins’s life.\nWithin ﬁ  ve years of that partnership, Hopkins turned Pepsodent \ninto one of the  best- known products on earth and,",

Soon, everyone from Shirley Temple to Clark Gable was bragging about their “Pepsodent smile.” By 1930, Pepsodent was sold in China, South Africa, Brazil, Germany, and almost any-where else Hopkins could buy ads. A decade after the ﬁ  rst Pepso-\ndent campaign, pollsters found that toothbrushing had become a daily ritual for more than half the American population. Hopkins had helped establish toothbrushing as a daily activity.\nThe secret to his success, Hopkins would later boast, was that he \nhad found a certain kind of cue and reward that fueled a particular habit. It’s an alchemy so powerful that even today the basic princi-ples are still used by consumer goods giants, video game designers, food companies, hospitals, and millions of salesmen around the world. Eugene Pauly taught us about the habit loop, but it was Claude Hopkins that showed how new habits can be cultivated and grown.\nSo what, exactly, did Hopkins do?He created a craving. And that craving, it turns out, is what \nmakes cues and rewards work. That craving is what powers the habit loop.\n● ● ●\nThroughout his career, one of Claude Hopkins’s signature tactics was to ﬁ  nd simple triggers to convince consumers to use his prod-\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   33 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   33 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n34 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nucts every day. He sold Quaker Oats, for instance, as a breakfast ce-\nreal that could provide energy for  twenty- four  hours— but only if you ate a bowl every morning. He hawked tonics that cured stom-achaches, joint pain, bad skin, and “womanly problems”—but only if you drank the medicine at symptoms’ ﬁ  rst appearance. Soon, peo-\nple were devouring oatmeal at daybreak and chugging from little brown bottles whenever they felt a hint of fatigue or indigestion, which, as luck would have it, often happened at least once a day.\nTo sell Pepsodent, then, Hopkins needed a trigger that would \njustify the toothpaste’s daily use. He sat down with a pile of dental textbooks. “It was dry reading,” he later wrote. “But in the middle of one book I found a reference to the mucin plaques on teeth, which I afterward called ‘the ﬁ  lm.’ That gave me an appealing idea. I re-\nsolved to advertise this toothpaste as a creator of beauty. To deal with that cloudy ﬁ  lm.”\nIn focusing on tooth ﬁ  lm, Hopkins was ignoring the fact that \nthis same ﬁ  lm has always covered people’s teeth and hadn ’t seemed \nto bother anyone. The ﬁ  lm is a naturally occurring membrane that \nbuilds up on teeth regardless of what you eat or how often you brush. People had never paid much attention to it, and there was little reason why they should: You can get rid of the ﬁ  lm by eating an \napple, running your ﬁ  nger over your teeth, brushing, or vigorously \nswirling liquid around your mouth. Toothpaste didn ’t do anything to help remove the ﬁ  lm. In fact, one of the leading dental researchers \nof the time said that all  toothpastes— particularly  Pepsodent— were worthless.\nThat didn ’t stop Hopkins from exploiting his discovery. Here, he \ndecided, was a cue that could trigger a habit. Soon, cities were plas-tered with Pepsodent ads.\n“Just run your tongue across your teeth,” read one. “ You’ll feel a \n ﬁ lm— that’s what makes your teeth look ‘off color’ and invites decay.”\n“Note how many pretty teeth are seen everywhere,” read another \nad, featuring smiling beauties. “Millions are using a new method of \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   34 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   34 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Craving Brain ● 35\nteeth cleansing. Why would any woman have dingy ﬁ  lm on her \nteeth?

Soon, everyone from Shirley Temple to Clark Gable was bragging about their “Pepsodent smile.” By 1930, Pepsodent was sold in China, South Africa, Brazil, Germany, and almost any-where else Hopkins could buy ads. A decade after the ﬁ  rst Pepso-\ndent campaign, pollsters found that toothbrushing had become a daily ritual for more than half the American population. Hopkins had helped establish toothbrushing as a daily activity.\nThe secret to his success, Hopkins would later boast, was that he \nhad found a certain kind of cue and reward that fueled a particular habit. It’s an alchemy so powerful that even today the basic princi-ples are still used by consumer goods giants, video game designers, food companies, hospitals, and millions of salesmen around the world. Eugene Pauly taught us about the habit loop, but it was Claude Hopkins that showed how new habits can be cultivated and grown.\nSo what, exactly, did Hopkins do?He created a craving.

He hawked tonics that cured stom-achaches, joint pain, bad skin, and “womanly problems”—but only if you drank the medicine at symptoms’ ﬁ  rst appearance. Soon, peo-\nple were devouring oatmeal at daybreak and chugging from little brown bottles whenever they felt a hint of fatigue or indigestion, which, as luck would have it, often happened at least once a day.\nTo sell Pepsodent, then, Hopkins needed a trigger that would \njustify the",

    "text": " in the process, helped create a toothbrushing habit that moved across America with startling speed. Soon, everyone from Shirley Temple to Clark Gable was bragging about their “Pepsodent smile.” By 1930, Pepsodent was sold in China, South Africa, Brazil, Germany, and almost any-where else Hopkins could buy ads. A decade after the ﬁ  rst Pepso-\ndent campaign, pollsters found that toothbrushing had become a daily ritual for more than half the American population. Hopkins had helped establish toothbrushing as a daily activity.\nThe secret to his success, Hopkins would later boast, was that he \nhad found a certain kind of cue and reward that fueled a particular habit. It’s an alchemy so powerful that even today the basic princi-ples are still used by consumer goods giants, video game designers, food companies, hospitals, and millions of salesmen around the world. Eugene Pauly taught us about the habit loop, but it was Claude Hopkins that showed how new habits can be cultivated and grown.\nSo what, exactly, did Hopkins do?He created a craving. And that craving, it turns out, is what \nmakes cues and rewards work. That craving is what powers the habit loop",

He sat down with a pile of dental textbooks. “It was dry reading,” he later wrote. “But in the middle of one book I found a reference to the mucin plaques on teeth, which I afterward called ‘the ﬁ  lm.’ That gave me an appealing idea. I re-\nsolved to advertise this toothpaste as a creator of beauty. To deal with that cloudy ﬁ  lm.”\nIn focusing on tooth ﬁ  lm, Hopkins was ignoring the fact that \nthis same ﬁ  lm has always covered people’s teeth and hadn ’t seemed \nto bother anyone. The ﬁ  lm is a naturally occurring membrane that \nbuilds up on teeth regardless of what you eat or how often you brush. People had never paid much attention to it, and there was little reason why they should: You can get rid of the ﬁ  lm by eating an \napple, running your ﬁ  nger over your teeth, brushing, or vigorously \nswirling liquid around your mouth. Toothpaste didn ’t do anything to help remove the ﬁ  lm. In fact, one of the leading dental researchers \nof the time said that all  toothpastes— particularly  Pepsodent— were worthless.\nThat didn ’t stop Hopkins from exploiting his discovery. Here, he \ndecided, was a cue that could trigger a habit. Soon, cities were plas-tered with Pepsodent ads.\n“Just run your tongue across your teeth,” read one. “ You’ll feel a \n ﬁ lm— that’s what makes your teeth look ‘off color’ and invites decay.”\n“Note how many pretty teeth are seen everywhere,” read another \nad, featuring smiling beauties. “Millions are using a new method of \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   34 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   34 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Craving Brain ● 35\nteeth cleansing.

He sat down with a pile of dental textbooks. “It was dry reading,” he later wrote. “But in the middle of one book I found a reference to the mucin plaques on teeth, which I afterward called ‘the ﬁ  lm.’ That gave me an appealing idea. I re-\nsolved to advertise this toothpaste as a creator of beauty. To deal with that cloudy ﬁ  lm.”\nIn focusing on tooth ﬁ  lm, Hopkins was ignoring the fact that \nthis same ﬁ  lm has always covered people’s teeth and hadn ’t seemed \nto bother anyone. The ﬁ  lm is a naturally occurring membrane that \nbuilds up on teeth regardless of what you eat or how often you brush. People had never paid much attention to it, and there was little reason why they should: You can get rid of the ﬁ  lm by eating an \napple, running your ﬁ  nger over your teeth, brushing, or vigorously",

Tell-\ning someone to run their tongue across their teeth, it turns out, is likely to cause them to run their tongue across their teeth. And when they did, they were likely to feel a ﬁ  lm. Hopkins had found a cue \nthat was simple, had existed for aeons, and was so easy to trigger that an advertisement could cause people to comply automatically.\nMoreover, the reward, as Hopkins envisioned it, was even more \nenticing. Who, after all, doesn ’t want to be more beautiful? Who doesn ’t want a prettier smile? Particularly when all it takes is a quick brush with Pepsodent?\nAfter the campaign launched, a quiet week passed. Then two. \nThen, in the third week, demand exploded. There were so many orders for Pepsodent that the company couldn ’t keep up. In three years, the product went international, and Hopkins was crafting ads in Spanish, German, and Chinese. Within a decade, Pepsodent was one of the  top- selling goods in the world. It would remain America’s  best- selling toothpaste for more than thirty years, earning billions.\nBefore Pepsodent appeared, only 7 percent of Americans had a \ntube of toothpaste in their medicine chests. A decade after Hop-Routine\nReward Cue\nHOPKINS’S CONCEPTION \nOF THE PEPSODENT HABIT LOOP\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   35 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   35 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n36 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nkins’s ad campaign went nationwide, that number had jumped to 65 \npercent. By the end of World War II, the military downgraded con-cerns about recruits’ teeth because so many soldiers were brushing every day.\n“I made for myself a million dollars on Pepsodent,” Hopkins \nwrote a few years after the product appeared on shelves. The key, he said, was that he had “learned the right human psychology.” That psychology was grounded in two basic rules:\nFirst, ﬁ  nd a simple and obvious cue.\nSecond, clearly deﬁ  ne the rewards.\nIf you get those elements right, Hopkins promised, it was like \nmagic. Look at Pepsodent: He had identiﬁ  ed a  cue— tooth  ﬁ  lm— and \na  reward— beautiful  teeth— that had persuaded millions to start a daily ritual. Even today, Hopkins’s rules are a staple of marketing textbooks and the foundation of millions of ad campaigns.\nAnd those same principles have been used to create thousands of \nother  habits— often without people realizing how closely they are hewing to Hopkins’s formula. Studies of people who have success-fully started new exercise routines, for instance, show they are more likely to stick with a workout plan if they choose a speciﬁ  c cue, such \nas running as soon as they get home from work, and a clear reward, such as a beer or an evening of  guilt- free television. Research on dieting says creating new food habits requires a predetermined  cue— such as planning menus in  advance— and simple rewards for dieters when they stick to their intentions.\n“The time has come when advertising has in some hands reached \nthe status of a science,” Hopkins wrote. “ Advertising, once a gam-ble, has thus become, under able direction, one of the safest of busi-ness ventures.”\nIt’s quite a boast. However, it turns out that Hopkins’s two rules \naren ’t enough. There’s also a third rule that must be fulﬁ  lled to cre-\nate a  habit— a rule so subtle that Hopkins himself relied on it with-out knowing it existed. It explains everything from why it’s so hard \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   36 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   36 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Craving Brain ● 37\nto ignore a box of doughnuts to how a morning jog can become a \nnearly effortless routine.\nII.\nThe scientists and marketing executives at Procter & Gamble were gathered around a  beat- up table in a small, windowless room, read-ing the transcript of an interview with a woman who owned nine cats, when one of them ﬁ  nally said what",

Tell-\ning someone to run their tongue across their teeth, it turns out, is likely to cause them to run their tongue across their teeth. And when they did, they were likely to feel a ﬁ  lm. Hopkins had found a cue \nthat was simple, had existed for aeons, and was so easy to trigger that an advertisement could cause people to comply automatically.\nMoreover, the reward, as Hopkins envisioned it, was even more \nenticing. Who, after all, doesn ’t want to be more beautiful? Who doesn ’t want a prettier smile? Particularly when all it takes is a quick brush with Pepsodent?\nAfter the campaign launched, a quiet week passed. Then two. \nThen, in the third week, demand exploded. There were so many orders for Pepsodent that the company couldn ’t keep up. In three years, the product went international, and Hopkins was crafting ads in Spanish, German, and Chinese.

By the end of World War II, the military downgraded con-cerns about recruits’ teeth because so many soldiers were brushing every day.\n“I made for myself a million dollars on Pepsodent,” Hopkins \nwrote a few years after the product appeared on shelves.

    "text": " dollars on Pepsodent,” Hopkins \nwrote a few years after the product appeared on shelves. The key, he said, was that he had “learned the right human psychology.” That psychology was grounded in two basic rules:\nFirst, ﬁ  nd a simple and obvious cue.\nSecond, clearly deﬁ  ne the rewards.\nIf you get those elements right, Hopkins promised, it was like \nmagic. Look at Pepsodent: He had identiﬁ  ed a  cue— tooth  ﬁ  lm— and \na  reward— beautiful  teeth— that had persuaded millions to start a daily ritual. Even today, Hopkins’s rules are a staple of marketing textbooks and the foundation of millions of ad campaigns.\nAnd those same principles have been used to create thousands of \nother  habits— often without people realizing how closely they are hewing to Hopkins’s formula. Studies of people who have success-fully started new exercise routines, for instance, show they are more likely to stick with a workout plan if they choose a speciﬁ  c cue, such \nas running as soon as they get home from work, and a clear reward, such as a beer or an evening of  guilt- free television. Research on dieting says creating new food habits requires a predetermined  cue— such as planning menus in  advance— and simple rewards for dieters when they stick to their intentions.\n“The time has come when advertising has in some hands reached \nthe status of a science,” Hopkins wrote. “ Advertising, once a gam-ble, has thus become, under able direction, one of the safest of busi-ness ventures.”\nIt’s quite a boast. However, it turns out that Hopkins’s two rules \naren ’t enough. There’s also a third rule that must be fulﬁ  lled to cre-\nate a  habit— a rule so subtle that Hopkins himself relied on it with-out knowing it existed. It explains everything from why it’s so hard \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   36 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   36 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Craving Brain ● 37\nto ignore a box of doughnuts to how a morning jog can become a \nnearly effortless routine.\nII.\nThe scientists and marketing",

    "text": " dollars on Pepsodent,” Hopkins \nwrote a few years after the product appeared on shelves. The key, he said, was that he had “learned the right human psychology.” That psychology was grounded in two basic rules:\nFirst, ﬁ  nd a simple and obvious cue.\nSecond, clearly deﬁ  ne the rewards.\nIf you get those elements right, Hopkins promised, it was like \nmagic. Look at Pepsodent: He had identiﬁ  ed a  cue— tooth  ﬁ  lm— and \na  reward— beautiful  teeth— that had persuaded millions to start a daily ritual. Even today, Hopkins’s rules are a staple of marketing textbooks and the foundation of millions of ad campaigns.\nAnd those same principles have been used to create thousands of \nother  habits— often without people realizing how closely they are hewing to Hopkins’s formula. Studies of people who have success-fully started new exercise routines, for instance, show they are more likely to stick with a workout plan if they choose a speciﬁ  c cue, such \nas running as soon as they get home from work, and a clear reward, such as a beer or an evening of  guilt- free television.",

    "text": " executives at Procter & Gamble were gathered around a  beat- up table in a small, windowless room, read-ing the transcript of an interview with a woman who owned nine cats, when one of them ﬁ  nally said what everyone was thinking.\n“If we get ﬁ  red, what exactly happens?” she asked. “Do security \nguards show up and walk us out, or do we get some kind of warning beforehand?”\nThe team ’s leader, a onetime rising star within the company \nnamed Drake Stimson, stared at her.\n“I don ’t know,” he said. His hair was a mess. His eyes were tired. \n“I never thought things would get this bad. They told me running this project was a promotion.”\nIt was 1996, and the group at the table was ﬁ  nding out, despite \nClaude Hopkins’s assertions, how utterly unscientiﬁ  c the process of \nselling something could become. They all worked for one of the largest consumer goods ﬁ  rms on earth, the company behind Prin-\ngles potato chips, Oil of Olay, Bounty paper towels, CoverGirl cos-metics, Dawn, Downy, and Duracell, as well as dozens of other brands. P&G collected more data than almost any other merchant on earth and relied on complex statistical methods to craft their marketing campaigns. The ﬁ  rm was incredibly good at ﬁ  guring out \nhow to sell things. In the  clothes- washing market alone, P&G’s products cleaned one out of every two laundry loads in America. Its revenues topped $35 billion per year.\nHowever, Stimson ’s team, which had been entrusted with de-\nsigning the ad campaign for one of P&G’s most promising new products, was on the brink of failure. The company had spent mil-lions of dollars developing a spray that could remove bad smells \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   37 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   37 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n38 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nfrom almost any fabric. And the researchers in that tiny, windowless \nroom had no idea how to get people to buy it.\nThe spray had been created about three years earlier, when one \nof P&G’s chemists was working with a substance called hydroxypro-pyl beta cyclodextrin, or HPBCD, in a laboratory. The chemist was a smoker. His clothes usually smelled like an ashtray. One day, after working with HPBCD, his wife greeted him at the door when he got home.\n“Did you quit smoking?” she asked him.“No,” he said. He was suspicious. She had been harassing him to \ngive up cigarettes for years. This seemed like some kind of reverse psychology trickery.\n“You don ’t smell like smoke, is all,” she said.The next day, he went back to the lab and started experimenting \nwith HPBCD and various scents. Soon, he had hundreds of vials containing fabrics that smelled like wet dogs, cigars, sweaty socks, Chinese food, musty shirts, and dirty towels. When he put HPBCD in water and sprayed it on the samples, the scents were drawn into the chemical’s molecules. After the mist dried, the smell was gone.\nWhen the chemist explained his ﬁ  ndings to P&G’s executives, they \nwere ecstatic. For years, market research had said that consumers were clamoring for something that could get rid of bad  smells— not mask them, but eradicate them altogether. When one team of re-searchers had interviewed customers in their homes, they found that many of them left their blouses or slacks outside after a night at a bar or party. “My clothes smell like cigarettes when I get home, but I don ’t want to pay for dry cleaning every time I go out,” one woman said.\nP&G, sensing an opportunity, launched a  top- secret project to \nturn HPBCD into a viable product. They spent millions perfecting the formula, ﬁ  nally producing a colorless, odorless liquid that could \nwipe out almost any foul odor. The science behind the spray was so advanced that NASA would eventually use it to clean the interiors of shuttles after they returned from space. The best part was that it was \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   38 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   38 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Craving Brain ● 39\ncheap to",

P&G collected more data than almost any other merchant on earth and relied on complex statistical methods to craft their marketing campaigns.

    "text": " executives at Procter & Gamble were gathered around a  beat- up table in a small, windowless room, read-ing the transcript of an interview with a woman who owned nine cats, when one of them ﬁ  nally said what everyone was thinking.\n“If we get ﬁ  red, what exactly happens?” she asked. “Do security \nguards show up and walk us out, or do we get some kind of warning beforehand?”\nThe team ’s leader, a onetime rising star within the company \nnamed Drake Stimson, stared at her.\n“I don ’t know,” he said. His hair was a mess. His eyes were tired. \n“I never thought things would get this bad. They told me running this project was a promotion.”\nIt was 1996, and the group at the table was ﬁ  nding out, despite \nClaude Hopkins’s assertions, how utterly unscientiﬁ  c the process of \nselling something could become. They all worked for one of the largest consumer goods ﬁ  rms on earth, the company behind Prin-\ngles potato chips, Oil of Olay, Bounty paper towels, CoverGirl cos-metics, Dawn, Downy, and Duracell, as well",

And the researchers in that tiny, windowless \nroom had no idea how to get people to buy it.\nThe spray had been created about three years earlier, when one \nof P&G’s chemists was working with a substance called hydroxypro-pyl beta cyclodextrin, or HPBCD, in a laboratory. The chemist was a smoker. His clothes usually smelled like an ashtray. One day, after working with HPBCD, his wife greeted him at the door when he got home.\n“Did you quit smoking?” she asked him.“No,” he said. He was suspicious. She had been harassing him to \ngive up cigarettes for years. This seemed like some kind of reverse psychology trickery.\n“You don ’t smell like smoke, is all,” she said.The next day, he went back to the lab and started experimenting \nwith HPBCD and various scents. Soon, he had hundreds of vials containing fabrics that smelled like wet dogs, cigars, sweaty socks, Chinese food, musty shirts, and dirty towels. When he put HPBCD in water and sprayed it on the samples, the scents were drawn into the chemical’s molecules. After the mist dried, the smell was gone.\nWhen the chemist explained his ﬁ  ndings to P&G’s executives, they \nwere ecstatic. For years, market research had said that consumers were clamoring for something that could get rid of bad  smells— not mask them, but eradicate them altogether. When one team of re-searchers had interviewed customers in their homes, they found that many of them left their blouses or slacks outside after a night at a bar or party. “My clothes smell like cigarettes when I get home, but I don ’t want to pay for dry cleaning every time I go out,” one woman said.\nP&G, sensing an opportunity, launched a  top- secret project to \nturn HPBCD into a viable product. They spent millions perfecting the formula, ﬁ  nally producing a colorless, odorless liquid that could \nwipe out almost any foul odor. The science behind the spray was so advanced that NASA would eventually use it to clean the interiors of shuttles after they returned from space. The best part was that it was \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   38 Duhi_978140",

The project had been a major gamble, but P&G was now poised to earn  billions— if they could come up with the right marketing campaign.\nThey decided to call it Febreze, and asked Stimson, a  thirty- \none- year- old wunderkind with a background in math and psychol-\nogy, to lead the marketing team. Stimson was tall and handsome, with a strong chin, a gentle voice, and a taste for  high- end meals. (“I’d rather my kids smoked weed than ate in McDonald’s,” he once told a colleague.) Before joining P&G, he had spent ﬁ  ve years on \nWall Street building mathematical models for choosing stocks. When he relocated to Cincinnati, where P&G was headquartered, he was tapped to help run important business lines, including Bounce fabric softener and Downy dryer sheets. But Febreze was different. It was a chance to launch an entirely new category of  product— to add something to a consumer’s shopping cart that had never been there before. All Stimson needed to do was ﬁ  gure out \nhow to make Febreze into a habit, and the product would ﬂ  y off the \nshelves. How tough could that be?\nStimson and his colleagues decided to introduce Febreze in a \nfew test  markets— Phoenix, Salt Lake City, and Boise. They ﬂ  ew in \nand handed out samples, and then asked people if they could come by their homes. Over the course of two months, they visited hun-dreds of households. Their ﬁ  rst big breakthrough came when they \nvisited a park ranger in Phoenix. She was in her late twenties and lived by herself. Her job was to trap animals that wandered out of the desert. She caught coyotes, raccoons, the occasional mountain lion. And skunks. Lots and lots of skunks. Which often sprayed her when they were caught.\n“I’m single, and I’d like to ﬁ  nd someone to have kids with,” the \nranger told Stimson and his colleagues while they sat in her living room. “I go on a lot of dates. I mean, I think I’m attractive, you know? I’m smart and I feel like I’m a good catch.”\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   39 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   39 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n40 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nBut her love life was crippled, she explained, because everything \nin her life smelled like skunk. Her house, her truck, her clothing, her boots, her hands, her curtains. Even her bed. She had tried all sorts of cures. She bought special soaps and shampoos. She burned candles and used expensive carpet shampooing machines. None of it worked.\n“When I’m on a date, I’ll get a whiff of something that smells \nlike skunk and I’ll start obsessing about it,” she told them. “I’ll start wondering, does he smell it? What if I bring him home and he wants to leave?\n“I went on four dates last year with a really nice guy, a guy I really \nliked, and I waited forever to invite him to my place. Eventually, he came over, and I thought everything was going really well. Then the next day, he said he wanted to ‘take a break.’ He was really polite about it, but I keep wondering, was it the smell?”\n“Well, I’m glad you got a chance to try Febreze,” Stimson said. \n“How’d you like it?”\nShe looked at him. She was crying.“I want to thank you,” she said. “This spray has changed my life.”After she had received samples of Febreze, she had gone home \nand sprayed her couch. She sprayed the curtains, the rug, the bed-spread, her jeans, her uniform, the interior of her car. The bottle ran out, so she got another one, and sprayed everything else.\n“I’ve asked all of my friends to come over,” the woman said. \n“They can ’t smell it anymore. The skunk is gone.”\nBy now, she was crying so hard that one of Stimson ’s colleagues \nwas patting her on the shoulder. “Thank you so much,” the",

The project had been a major gamble, but P&G was now poised to earn  billions— if they could come up with the right marketing campaign.\nThey decided to call it Febreze, and asked Stimson, a  thirty- \none- year- old wunderkind with a background in math and psychol-\nogy, to lead the marketing team. Stimson was tall and handsome, with a strong chin, a gentle voice, and a taste for  high- end meals. (“I’d rather my kids smoked weed than ate in McDonald’s,” he once told a colleague.) Before joining P&G, he had spent ﬁ  ve years on \nWall Street building mathematical models for choosing stocks. When he relocated to Cincinnati, where P&G was headquartered, he was tapped to help run important business lines, including Bounce fabric softener and Downy dryer sheets. But Febreze was different. It was a chance to launch an entirely new category of  product— to add something to a consumer’s shopping cart that had never been there before. All Stimson needed to do was ﬁ  gure out \nhow to make Febreze into a habit, and the product would ﬂ  y off the \nshelves. How tough could that be?\nStimson and his colleagues decided to introduce Febreze in a \nfew test  markets— Phoenix, Salt Lake City, and Boise. They ﬂ  ew in \nand handed out samples, and then asked people if they could come by their homes. Over the course of two months, they visited hun-dreds of households. Their ﬁ  rst big breakthrough came when they \nvisited a park ranger in Phoenix. She was in her late twenties and lived by herself. Her job was to trap animals that wandered out of the desert. She caught coyotes, raccoons, the occasional mountain lion. And skunks. Lots and lots of skunks. Which often sprayed her when they were caught.\n“I’m single, and I’d like to ﬁ  nd someone to have kids with,” the \nranger",

The skunk is gone.”\nBy now, she was crying so hard that one of Stimson ’s colleagues \nwas patting her on the shoulder. “Thank you so much,” the woman said. “I feel so free. Thank you. This product is so important.”\nStimson sniffed the air inside her living room. He couldn ’t smell \nanything. We’re going to make a fortune with this stuff, he thought.\n● ● ●\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   40 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   40 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Craving Brain ● 41\nStimson and his team went back to P&G headquarters and started \nreviewing the marketing campaign they were about to roll out. The key to selling Febreze, they decided, was conveying that sense of relief the park ranger felt. They had to position Febreze as some-thing that would allow people to rid themselves of embarrassing smells. All of them were familiar with Claude Hopkins’s rules, or the modern incarnations that ﬁ  lled business school textbooks. They \nwanted to keep the ads simple: Find an obvious cue and clearly de-ﬁ ne the reward.\nThey designed two television commercials. The ﬁ  rst showed a \nwoman talking about the smoking section of a restaurant. When-ever she eats there, her jacket smells like smoke. A friend tells her if she uses Febreze, it will eliminate the odor. The cue: the smell of cigarettes. The reward: odor eliminated from clothes. The second ad featured a woman worrying about her dog, Sophie, who always sits on the couch. “Sophie will always smell like Sophie,” she says, but with Febreze, “now my furniture doesn ’t have to.” The cue: pet smells, which are familiar to the seventy million households with animals. The reward: a house that doesn ’t smell like a kennel.\nStimson and his colleagues began airing the advertisements in \n1996 in the same test cities. They gave away samples, put advertise-ments in mailboxes, and paid grocers to build mountains of Febreze near cash registers. Then they sat back, anticipating how they would spend their bonuses.\nA week passed. Then two. A month. Two months. Sales started \n small— and got smaller. Panicked, the company sent researchers into stores to see what was happening. Shelves were ﬁ  lled with Fe-\nbreze bottles that had never been touched. They started visiting housewives who had received free bottles.\n“Oh, yes!” one of them told a P&G researcher. “The spray! I re-\nmember it. Let’s see.” The woman got down on her knees in the kitchen and started rooting through the cabinet underneath the \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   41 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   41 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n42 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nsink. “I used it for a while, but then I forgot about it. I think it’s back \nhere somewhere.” She stood up. “Maybe it’s in the closet?” She walked over and pushed aside some brooms. “Yes! Here it is! In the back! See? It’s still almost full. Did you want it back?”\nFebreze was a dud.For Stimson, this was a disaster. Rival executives in other divi-\nsions sensed an opportunity in his failure. He heard whispers that some people were lobbying to kill Febreze and get him reassigned to Nicky Clarke hair products, the consumer goods equivalent of Siberia.\nOne of P&G’s divisional presidents called an emergency meet-\ning and announced they had to cut their losses on Febreze before board members started asking questions. Stimson ’s boss stood up and made an impassioned plea. “There’s still a chance to turn every-thing around,” he said. “ At the very least, let’s ask the PhDs to ﬁ  gure \nout what’s going on.” P&G had recently snapped up scientists from Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, and elsewhere who were supposed ex-perts in consumer psychology. The division ’s president agreed to give the product a little more time.\nSo a new group of researchers joined Stimson ’s team and started \nconducting more interviews. Their ﬁ  rst inkling of why Febreze was \nfailing came when they visited a woman ’s home outside Phoenix. They could smell her nine cats before they went inside",

The skunk is gone.”\nBy now, she was crying so hard that one of Stimson ’s colleagues \nwas patting her on the shoulder. “Thank you so much,” the woman said. “I feel so free. Thank you. This product is so important.”\nStimson sniffed the air inside her living room. He couldn ’t smell \nanything. We’re going to make a fortune with this stuff, he thought.\n● ● ●\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   40 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   40 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Craving Brain ● 41\nStimson and his team went back to P&G headquarters and started \nreviewing the marketing campaign they were about to roll out. The key to selling Febreze, they decided, was conveying that sense of relief the park ranger felt. They had to position Febreze as some-thing that would allow people to rid themselves of embarrassing smells. All of them were familiar with Claude Hopkins’s rules, or the modern incarnations that ﬁ  lled business school textbooks. They \nwanted to keep the ads simple: Find an obvious cue and clearly de-ﬁ ne the reward.\nThey designed two television commercials. The ﬁ  rst showed a \nwoman talking about the smoking section of a restaurant. When-ever she eats there, her jacket smells like smoke. A friend tells her if she uses Febreze, it will eliminate the odor. The cue: the smell of cigarettes. The reward: odor eliminated from clothes. The second ad featured a woman worrying about her dog, Sophie, who always sits on the couch. “Sophie will always smell like Sophie,” she says, but with Febreze, “now my furniture doesn ’t have to.” The cue: pet smells, which are familiar to the seventy million households with animals. The reward: a house that doesn ’t smell like a kennel.\nStimson and his colleagues began airing the advertisements in \n1996 in the same test cities. They gave away samples, put advertise-ments in mailboxes, and paid grocers to build mountains of Febreze near cash registers. Then they sat back, anticipating how they would spend their bonuses.\nA week passed. Then",

He heard whispers that some people were lobbying to kill Febreze and get him reassigned to Nicky Clarke hair products, the consumer goods equivalent of Siberia.\nOne of P&G’s divisional presidents called an emergency meet-\ning and announced they had to cut their losses on Febreze before board members started asking questions. Stimson ’s boss stood up and made an impassioned plea. “There’s still a chance to turn every-thing around,” he said. “ At the very least, let’s ask the PhDs to ﬁ  gure \nout what’s going on.” P&G had recently snapped up scientists from Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, and elsewhere who were supposed ex-perts in consumer psychology.

They could smell her nine cats before they went inside. The house’s interior, however, was clean and organized. She was somewhat of a neat freak, the woman explained. She vacuumed every day and didn ’t like to open her windows, since the wind blew in dust. When Stimson and the scientists walked into her living room, where the cats lived, the scent was so overpowering that one of them gagged.\n“What do you do about the cat smell?” a scientist asked the \nwoman.\n“It’s usually not a problem,” she said.“How often do you notice a smell?”“Oh, about once a month,” the woman replied.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   42 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   42 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Craving Brain ● 43\nThe researchers looked at one another.\n“Do you smell it now?” a scientist asked.“No,” she said.The same pattern played out in dozens of other smelly homes \nthe researchers visited. People couldn ’t detect most of the bad smells in their lives. If you live with nine cats, you become desensitized to their scent. If you smoke cigarettes, it damages your olfactory ca-pacities so much that you can ’t smell smoke anymore. Scents are strange; even the strongest fade with constant exposure. That’s why no one was using Febreze, Stimson realized. The product’s  cue— the thing that was supposed to trigger daily  use— was hidden from the people who needed it most. Bad scents simply weren ’t noticed fre-quently enough to trigger a regular habit. As a result, Febreze ended up in the back of a closet. The people with the greatest proclivity to use the spray never smelled the odors that should have reminded them the living room needed a spritz.\nStimson ’s team went back to headquarters and gathered in the \nwindowless conference room, rereading the transcript of the woman with nine cats. The psychologist asked what happens if you get ﬁ  red. \nStimson put his head in his hands. If he couldn ’t sell Febreze to a woman with nine cats, he wondered, who could he sell it to? How do \nyou build a new habit when there’s no cue to trigger usage, and when the consumers who most need it don ’t appreciate the reward?\nIII.\nThe laboratory belonging to Wolfram Schultz, a professor of neu-roscience at the University of Cambridge, is not a pretty place. His desk has been alternately described by colleagues as a black hole where documents are lost forever and a petri dish where organ-isms can grow, undisturbed and in wild proliferation, for years. When Schultz needs to clean something, which is uncommon, he doesn ’t use sprays or cleansers. He wets a paper towel and wipes \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   43 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   43 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n44 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nhard. If his clothes smell like smoke or cat hair, he doesn ’t notice. \nOr care.\nHowever, the experiments that Schultz has conducted over the \npast twenty years have revolutionized our understanding of how cues, rewards, and habits interact. He has explained why some cues and rewards have more power than others, and has provided a sci-entiﬁ  c road map that explains why Pepsodent was a hit, how some \ndieters and exercise buffs manage to change their habits so quickly,  and— in the  end— what it took to make Febreze sell.\nIn the 1980s, Schultz was part of a group of scientists studying \nthe brains of monkeys as they learned to perform certain tasks, such as pulling on levers or opening clasps. Their goal was to ﬁ  gure out \nwhich parts of the brain were responsible for new actions.\n“One day, I noticed this thing that is interesting to me,” Schultz \ntold me. He was born in Germany and now, when he speaks English, sounds a bit like Arnold Schwarzenegger if the Terminator were a member of the Royal Society. “ A few of the monkeys we watched loved apple juice, and the other monkeys loved grape juice, and so I began to wonder, what is going on inside those little monkey heads? Why do different rewards affect",

They could smell her nine cats before they went inside. The house’s interior, however, was clean and organized. She was somewhat of a neat freak, the woman explained. She vacuumed every day and didn ’t like to open her windows, since the wind blew in dust. When Stimson and the scientists walked into her living room, where the cats lived, the scent was so overpowering that one of them gagged.\n“What do you do about the cat smell?” a scientist asked the \nwoman.\n“It’s usually not a problem,” she said.“How often do you notice a smell?”“Oh, about once a month,” the woman replied.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   42 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   42 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Craving Brain ● 43\nThe researchers looked at one another.\n“Do you smell it now?” a scientist asked.“No,” she said.The same pattern played out in dozens of other smelly homes \nthe researchers visited. People couldn ’t detect most of the bad smells in their lives. If you live with nine cats, you become desensitized to their scent. If you smoke cigarettes, it damages your olfactory ca-pacities so much that you can ’t smell smoke anymore. Scents are strange; even the strongest fade with constant exposure. That’s why no one was using Febreze, Stimson realized. The product’s  cue— the thing that was supposed to trigger daily  use— was hidden from the people who needed it most. Bad scents simply weren ’t noticed fre-quently enough to trigger a regular habit. As a result, Febreze ended up in the back of a closet. The people with the greatest proclivity to use the spray never smelled the odors that should have reminded them the living room needed a spritz.\nStimson ’s team went back to headquarters and gathered in the \nwindowless conference room, rereading the transcript of the woman with nine cats. The psychologist asked what happens if you get ﬁ  red. \nStimson put his head in his hands",

People couldn ’t detect most of the bad smells in their lives. If you live with nine cats, you become desensitized to their scent. If you smoke cigarettes, it damages your olfactory ca-pacities so much that you can ’t smell smoke anymore. Scents are strange; even the strongest fade with constant exposure. That’s why no one was using Febreze, Stimson realized. The product’s  cue— the thing that was supposed to trigger daily  use— was hidden from the people who needed it most. Bad scents simply weren ’t noticed fre-quently enough to trigger a regular habit. As a result, Febreze ended up in the back of a closet. The people with the greatest proclivity to use the spray never smelled the odors that should have reminded them the living room needed a spritz.\nStimson ’",

The psychologist asked what happens if you get ﬁ  red. \nStimson put his head in his hands. If he couldn ’t sell Febreze to a woman with nine cats, he wondered, who could he sell it to? How do \nyou build a new habit when there’s no cue to trigger usage, and when the consumers who most need it don ’t appreciate the reward?\nIII.\nThe laboratory belonging to Wolfram Schultz, a professor of neu-roscience at the University of Cambridge, is not a pretty place. His desk has been alternately described by colleagues as a black hole where documents are lost forever and a petri dish where organ-isms can grow, undisturbed and in wild proliferation, for years. When Schultz needs to clean something, which is uncommon, he doesn ’t use sprays or cleansers. He wets a paper towel and wipes \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   43 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   43 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n44 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nhard. If his clothes smell like smoke or cat hair, he doesn ’t notice. \nOr care.\nHowever, the experiments that Schultz has conducted over the \npast twenty years have revolutionized our understanding of how cues, rewards, and habits interact. He has explained why some cues and rewards have more power than others, and has provided a sci-entiﬁ  c road map that explains why Pepsodent was a hit, how some \ndieters and exercise buffs manage to change their habits so quickly,  and— in the  end— what it took to make Febreze sell.\nIn the 1980s, Schultz was part of a group of scientists studying \nthe brains of monkeys as they learned to perform certain tasks, such as pulling on levers or opening clasps. Their goal was to ﬁ  gure out \nwhich parts of the brain were responsible for new actions.\n“One day, I noticed this thing that is interesting to me,” Schultz \ntold me. He was born in Germany and now, when he speaks English, sounds a bit like Arnold Schwarzenegger if the Terminator",

Why do different rewards affect the brain in different ways?”\nSchultz began a series of experiments to decipher how rewards \nwork on a neurochemical level. As technology progressed, he gained access, in the 1990s, to devices similar to those used by the research-ers at MIT. Rather than rats, however, Schultz was interested in monkeys like Julio, an  eight- pound macaque with hazel eyes who had a very thin electrode inserted into his brain that allowed Schultz to observe neuronal activity as it occurred.\nOne day, Schultz positioned Julio on a chair in a dimly lit room \nand turned on a computer monitor. Julio’s job was to touch a lever whenever colored  shapes— small yellow spirals, red squiggles, blue  lines— appeared on the screen. If Julio touched the lever when a shape appeared, a drop of blackberry juice would run down a tube hanging from the ceiling and onto the monkey’s lips.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   44 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   44 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Craving Brain ● 45\nJulio liked blackberry juice.\nAt ﬁ rst, Julio was only mildly interested in what was happening \non the screen. He spent most of his time trying to squirm out of the chair. But once the ﬁ  rst dose of juice arrived, Julio became very fo-\ncused on the monitor. As the monkey came to understand, through dozens of repetitions, that the shapes on the screen were a cue for a routine (touch the lever) that resulted in a reward (blackberry juice), he started staring at the screen with a laserlike intensity. He didn ’t squirm. When a yellow squiggle appeared, he went for the lever. When a blue line ﬂ  ashed, he pounced. And when the juice arrived, \nJulio would lick his lips contentedly.\nAs Schultz monitored the activity within Julio’s brain, he saw a \npattern emerge. Whenever Julio received his reward, his brain activ-ity would spike in a manner that suggested he was experiencing happiness. A transcript of that neurological activity shows what it looks like when a monkey’s brain says, in essence, “I got a reward!”\nSchultz took Julio through the same experiment again and again, \nrecording the neurological response each time. Whenever Julio re-ceived his juice, the “I got a reward!” pattern appeared on the com-Shape\non Screen\nLever“I Got a Reward!”\nJuice\nJULIO’S REWARD RESPONSE WHEN\nHE RECEIVES THE JUICE\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   45 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   45 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n46 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nputer attached to the probe in the monkey’s head. Gradually, from a \nneurological perspective, Julio’s behavior became a habit.\nWhat was most interesting to Schultz, however, was how things \nchanged as the experiment proceeded. As the monkey became more and more practiced at the  behavior— as the habit became stronger and  stronger— Julio’s brain began anticipating the blackberry juice. \nSchultz’s probes started recording the “I got a reward!” pattern the instant Julio saw the shapes on the screen, before the juice arrived:\nIn other words, the shapes on the monitor had become a cue not \njust for pulling a lever, but also for a pleasure response inside the JULIO’S HABIT LOOPRoutine\nReward Cue\nShape\non ScreenLeverJuice\n“I Got a Reward!”\nNOW, JULIO’S REWARD RESPONSE\nOCCURS BEFORE THE JUICE ARRIVES\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   46 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   46 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Craving Brain ● 47\nmonkey’s brain. Julio started expecting his reward as soon as he saw \nthe yellow spirals and red squiggles.\nThen Schultz adjusted the experiment. Previously, Julio had re-\nceived juice as soon as he touched the lever. Now, sometimes, the juice didn ’t arrive at all, even if Julio performed correctly. Or it would",

Why do different rewards affect the brain in different ways?”\nSchultz began a series of experiments to decipher how rewards \nwork on a neurochemical level. As technology progressed, he gained access, in the 1990s, to devices similar to those used by the research-ers at MIT. Rather than rats, however, Schultz was interested in monkeys like Julio, an  eight- pound macaque with hazel eyes who had a very thin electrode inserted into his brain that allowed Schultz to observe neuronal activity as it occurred.\nOne day, Schultz positioned Julio on a chair in a dimly lit room \nand turned on a computer monitor. Julio’s job was to touch a lever whenever colored  shapes— small yellow spirals, red squiggles, blue  lines— appeared on the screen. If Julio touched the lever when a shape appeared, a drop of blackberry juice would run down a tube hanging from the ceiling and onto the monkey’s lips.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   44 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   44 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Craving Brain ● 45\nJulio liked blackberry juice.\nAt ﬁ rst, Julio was only mildly interested in what was happening \non the screen. He spent most of his time trying to squirm out of the chair. But once the ﬁ  rst dose of juice arrived, Julio became very fo-\ncused on the monitor. As the monkey came to understand, through dozens of repetitions, that the shapes on the screen were a cue for a routine (touch the lever) that resulted in a reward (blackberry juice), he started staring at the screen with a laserlike intensity. He didn ’t squirm. When a yellow squiggle appeared, he went for the lever. When a blue line ﬂ  ashed, he pounced. And when the juice arrived, \nJulio would lick his lips contentedly.\nAs Schultz monitored the activity within Julio’s brain, he saw a \npattern emerge. Whenever Julio received his reward, his brain activ-ity would spike in a manner that",

    "text": " were a member of the Royal Society. “ A few of the monkeys we watched loved apple juice, and the other monkeys loved grape juice, and so I began to wonder, what is going on inside those little monkey heads? Why do different rewards affect the brain in different ways?”\nSchultz began a series of experiments to decipher how rewards \nwork on a neurochemical level. As technology progressed, he gained access, in the 1990s, to devices similar to those used by the research-ers at MIT. Rather than rats, however, Schultz was interested in monkeys like Julio, an  eight- pound macaque with hazel eyes who had a very thin electrode inserted into his brain that allowed Schultz to observe neuronal activity as it occurred.\nOne day, Schultz positioned Julio on a chair in a dimly lit room \nand turned on a computer monitor. Julio’s job was to touch a lever whenever colored  shapes— small yellow spirals, red squiggles, blue  lines— appeared on the screen. If Julio touched the lever when a shape appeared, a drop of blackberry juice would run down a tube hanging from the ceiling and onto the monkey’s lips.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd  ",

He spent most of his time trying to squirm out of the chair. But once the ﬁ  rst dose of juice arrived, Julio became very fo-\ncused on the monitor. As the monkey came to understand, through dozens of repetitions, that the shapes on the screen were a cue for a routine (touch the lever) that resulted in a reward (blackberry juice), he started staring at the screen with a laserlike intensity. He didn ’t squirm. When a yellow squiggle appeared, he went for the lever. When a blue line ﬂ  ashed, he pounced.",

Now, sometimes, the juice didn ’t arrive at all, even if Julio performed correctly. Or it would arrive after a slight delay. Or it would be watered down until it was only half as sweet.\nWhen the juice didn ’t arrive or was late or diluted, Julio would get \nangry and make unhappy noises, or become mopey. And within Ju-lio’s brain, Schultz watched a new pattern emerge: craving. When Julio anticipated juice but didn ’t receive it, a neurological pattern as-sociated with desire and frustration erupted inside his skull. When Julio saw the cue, he started anticipating a  juice- fueled joy. But if the juice didn ’t arrive, that joy became a craving that, if unsatisﬁ  ed, \ndrove Julio to anger or depression.\nResearchers in other labs have found similar patterns. Other \nmonkeys were trained to anticipate juice whenever they saw a shape on a screen. Then, researchers tried to distract them. They opened the lab’s door, so the monkeys could go outside and play with their friends. They put food in a corner, so the monkeys could eat if they abandoned the experiment.\nFor those monkeys who hadn ’t developed a strong habit, the dis-\ntractions worked. They slid out of their chairs, left the room, and never looked back. They hadn ’t learned to crave the juice. However, once a monkey had developed a  habit— once its brain anticipated the \n reward— the distractions held no allure. The animal would sit there, watching the monitor and pressing the lever, over and over again, regardless of the offer of food or the opportunity to go outside. The anticipation and sense of craving was so overwhelming that the monkeys stayed glued to their screens, the same way a gambler will play slots long after he’s lost his winnings.\nThis explains why habits are so powerful: They create neurologi-\ncal cravings. Most of the time, these cravings emerge so gradually \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   47 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   47 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n48 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nthat we’re not really aware they exist, so we’re often blind to their \ninﬂ uence. But as we associate cues with certain rewards, a subcon-\nscious craving emerges in our brains that starts the habit loop spin-ning. One researcher at Cornell, for instance, found how powerfully food and scent cravings can affect behavior when he noticed how Cinnabon stores were positioned inside shopping malls. Most food sellers locate their kiosks in food courts, but Cinnabon tries to locate their stores away  from other food stalls. Why? Because Cinnabon \nexecutives want the smell of cinnamon rolls to waft down hallways and around corners uninterrupted, so that shoppers will start sub-consciously craving a roll. By the time a consumer turns a corner and sees the Cinnabon store, that craving is a roaring monster in-side his head and he’ll reach, unthinkingly, for his wallet. The habit loop is spinning because a sense of craving has emerged.\n“There is nothing programmed into our brains that makes us \nsee a box of doughnuts and automatically want a sugary treat,” Schultz told me. “But once our brain learns that a doughnut box contains yummy sugar and other carbohydrates, it will start antici-\npating the sugar high. Our brains will push us toward the box. Then, \nif we don ’t eat the doughnut, we’ll feel disappointed.”\nTo understand this process, consider how Julio’s habit emerged. \nFirst, he saw a shape on the screen:\nOver time, Julio learned that the appearance of the shape meant \nit was time to execute a routine. So he touched the lever:\nCue\nRoutine\nCue\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   48 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   48 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Craving Brain ● 49\nAs a result, Julio received a drop of blackberry juice.\nThat’s basic learning. The habit only emerges once Julio begins \ncraving the juice when he sees the cue. Once that craving exists, \nJulio will act automatically. He’ll follow the habit:\nThis is how new habits are created: by putting together a cue, a \nroutine, and a reward, and then cultivating a craving that drives the loop. Take, for instance, smoking.

Now, sometimes, the juice didn ’t arrive at all, even if Julio performed correctly. Or it would arrive after a slight delay. Or it would be watered down until it was only half as sweet.\nWhen the juice didn ’t arrive or was late or diluted, Julio would get \nangry and make unhappy noises, or become mopey. And within Ju-lio’s brain, Schultz watched a new pattern emerge: craving. When Julio anticipated juice but didn ’t receive it, a neurological pattern as-sociated with desire and frustration erupted inside his skull. When Julio saw the cue, he started anticipating a  juice- fueled joy. But if the juice didn ’t arrive, that joy became a craving that, if unsatisﬁ  ed, \ndrove Julio to anger or depression.\nResearchers in other labs have found similar patterns. Other \nmonkeys were trained to anticipate juice whenever they saw a shape on a screen. Then, researchers tried to distract them. They opened the lab’s door, so the monkeys could go outside and play with their friends. They put food in a corner, so the monkeys could eat if they abandoned the experiment.\nFor those monkeys who hadn ’t developed a strong habit, the dis-\ntractions worked. They slid out of their chairs, left the room, and never looked back. They hadn ’t learned to crave the juice. However, once a monkey had developed a  habit— once its brain anticipated the \n reward— the distractions held no allure. The animal would sit there, watching the monitor and pressing the lever, over and over again, regardless of the offer of food or the opportunity to go outside. The anticipation and sense of craving was so overwhelming that the monkeys stayed glued to their screens, the same way a gambler will play slots long after he’s lost his winnings.\nThis explains why habits are so powerful: They create neurologi-\ncal cravings. Most of the time, these cravings emerge so gradually \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   47 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   47 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n48 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nthat we’re not really aware they",

Now, sometimes, the juice didn ’t arrive at all, even if Julio performed correctly. Or it would arrive after a slight delay. Or it would be watered down until it was only half as sweet.\nWhen the juice didn ’t arrive or was late or diluted, Julio would get \nangry and make unhappy noises, or become mopey. And within Ju-lio’s brain, Schultz watched a new pattern emerge: craving. When Julio anticipated juice but didn ’t receive it, a neurological pattern as-sociated with desire and frustration erupted inside his skull. When Julio saw the cue, he started anticipating a  juice- fueled joy. But if the juice didn ’t arrive, that joy became a craving that, if unsatisﬁ  ed, \ndrove Julio to anger or depression.\nResearchers in other labs have found similar patterns. Other \nmonkeys were trained to anticipate juice whenever they saw a shape on a screen. Then, researchers tried to distract them. They opened the lab’s door, so the monkeys could go outside and play with their friends. They put food in a corner, so",

    "text": "keys were trained to anticipate juice whenever they saw a shape on a screen. Then, researchers tried to distract them. They opened the lab’s door, so the monkeys could go outside and play with their friends. They put food in a corner, so the monkeys could eat if they abandoned the experiment.\nFor those monkeys who hadn ’t developed a strong habit, the dis-\ntractions worked. They slid out of their chairs, left the room, and never looked back. They hadn ’t learned to crave the juice. However, once a monkey had developed a  habit— once its brain anticipated the \n reward— the distractions held no allure. The animal would sit there, watching the monitor and pressing the lever, over and over again, regardless of the offer of food or the opportunity to go outside. The anticipation and sense of craving was so overwhelming that the monkeys stayed glued to their screens, the same way a gambler will play slots long after he’s lost his winnings.\nThis explains why habits are so powerful: They create neurologi-\ncal cravings. Most of the time, these cravings emerge so gradually \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   47 Duhi_9781400069286_2p",

But as we associate cues with certain rewards, a subcon-\nscious craving emerges in our brains that starts the habit loop spin-ning. One researcher at Cornell, for instance, found how powerfully food and scent cravings can affect behavior when he noticed how Cinnabon stores were positioned inside shopping malls. Most food sellers locate their kiosks in food courts, but Cinnabon tries to locate their stores away  from other food stalls. Why? Because Cinnabon \nexecutives want the smell of cinnamon rolls to waft down hallways and around corners uninterrupted, so that shoppers will start sub-consciously craving a roll. By the time a consumer turns a corner and sees the Cinnabon store, that craving is a roaring monster in-side his head and he’ll reach, unthinkingly, for his wallet. The habit loop is spinning because a sense of craving has emerged.\n“There is nothing programmed into our brains that makes us \nsee a box of doughnuts and automatically want a sugary treat,” Schultz told me. “But once our brain learns that a doughnut box contains yummy sugar and other carbohydrates, it will start antici-\npating the sugar high. Our brains will push us toward the box. Then, \nif we don ’t eat the doughnut, we’ll feel disappointed.”\nTo understand this process, consider how Julio’s habit emerged. \nFirst, he saw a shape on the screen:\nOver time, Julio learned that the appearance of the shape meant \nit was time to execute a routine. So he touched the lever:\nCue\nRoutine\nCue\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   48 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   48 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Craving Brain ● 49\nAs a result, Julio received a drop of blackberry juice.\nThat’s basic learning. The habit only emerges once Julio begins \ncraving the juice when he sees the cue. Once that craving exists, \nJulio",

But as we associate cues with certain rewards, a subcon-\nscious craving emerges in our brains that starts the habit loop spin-ning. One researcher at Cornell, for instance, found how powerfully food and scent cravings can affect behavior when he noticed how Cinnabon stores were positioned inside shopping malls. Most food sellers locate their kiosks in food courts, but Cinnabon tries to locate their stores away  from other food stalls. Why? Because Cinnabon \nexecutives want the smell of cinnamon rolls to waft down hallways and around corners uninterrupted, so that shoppers will start sub-consciously craving a roll. By the time a consumer turns a corner and sees the Cinnabon store, that craving is a roaring monster in-side his head and he’ll reach, unthinkingly, for his wallet. The habit loop is spinning because a sense of craving has emerged.\n“There is nothing programmed into",

He’ll follow the habit:\nThis is how new habits are created: by putting together a cue, a \nroutine, and a reward, and then cultivating a craving that drives the loop. Take, for instance, smoking. When a smoker sees a  cue— say, a pack of  Marlboros— her brain starts anticipating a hit of nicotine.

If it doesn ’t arrive, the craving grows until the smoker reaches, unthinkingly, for a smoke.\nOr take email. When a computer chimes or a smartphone vi-\nbrates with a new message, the brain starts anticipating the mo-mentary distraction that opening an email provides. That expectation, if unsatisﬁ  ed, can build until a meeting is ﬁ  lled with antsy execu-\ntives checking their buzzing BlackBerrys under the table, even if they know it’s probably only their latest fantasy football results. (On the other hand, if someone disables the  buzzing— and, thus, re-moves the  cue— people can work for hours without thinking to check their  in- boxes.)\nScientists have studied the brains of alcoholics, smokers, and over-\neaters and have measured how their  neurology— the structures of their brains and the ﬂ  ow of neurochemicals inside their  skulls—\n changes as their cravings became ingrained. Particularly strong hab-its, wrote two researchers at the University of Michigan, produce  addiction- like reactions so that “wanting evolves into obsessive crav-ing” that can force our brains into autopilot, “even in the face of strong disincentives, including loss of reputation, job, home, and family.”\nHowever, these cravings don ’t have complete authority over us. \nAs the next chapter explains, there are mechanisms that can help us ignore the temptations. But to overpower the habit, we must recog-nize which craving is driving the behavior.

In 2002 researchers at New Mexico State University wanted to understand why people habitually exercise. They studied 266 individuals, most of whom worked out at least three times a week. What they found was that many of them had started running or lifting weights almost on a whim, or because they suddenly had free time or wanted to deal with unexpected stresses in their lives. However, the reason they  continued— why it became a \n habit— was because of a speciﬁ  c reward they started to crave.\nIn one group, 92 percent of people said they habitually exercised \nbecause it made them “feel good”—they grew to expect and crave the endorphins and other neurochemicals a workout provided. In another group, 67 percent of people said that working out gave them a sense of “accomplishment”—they had come to crave a regular sense of triumph from tracking their performances, and that  self- reward was enough to make the physical activity into a habit.\nIf you want to start running each morning, it’s essential that you \nchoose a simple cue (like always lacing up your sneakers before breakfast or leaving your running clothes next to your bed) and a clear reward (such as a midday treat, a sense of accomplishment from recording your miles, or the endorphin rush you get from a jog). But countless studies have shown that a cue and a reward, on their own, aren ’t enough for a new habit to last. Only when your brain starts expecting  the  reward— craving the endorphins or sense \nof  accomplishment— will it become automatic to lace up your jog-ging shoes each morning.

If it doesn ’t arrive, the craving grows until the smoker reaches, unthinkingly, for a smoke.\nOr take email. When a computer chimes or a smartphone vi-\nbrates with a new message, the brain starts anticipating the mo-mentary distraction that opening an email provides. That expectation, if unsatisﬁ  ed, can build until a meeting is ﬁ  lled with antsy execu-\ntives checking their buzzing BlackBerrys under the table, even if they know it’s probably only their latest fantasy football results. (On the other hand, if someone disables the  buzzing— and, thus, re-moves the  cue— people can work for hours without thinking to check their  in- boxes.)\nScientists have studied the brains of alcoholics, smokers, and over-\neaters and have measured how their  neurology— the structures of their brains and the ﬂ  ow of neurochemicals inside their  skulls—\n changes as their cravings became ingrained. Particularly strong hab-its, wrote two researchers at the University of Michigan, produce  addiction- like reactions so that “wanting evolves into obsessive crav-ing” that can force our brains into autopilot, “even in the face of strong disincentives, including loss of reputation, job, home, and family.”\nHowever, these cravings don ’t have complete authority over us. \nAs the next chapter explains, there are mechanisms that can help us ignore the tempt",

But to overpower the habit, we must recog-nize which craving is driving the behavior.

In 2002 researchers at New Mexico State University wanted to understand why people habitually exercise. They studied 266 individuals, most of whom worked out at least three times a week. What they found was that many of them had started running or lifting weights almost on a whim, or because they suddenly had free time or wanted to deal with unexpected stresses in their lives. However, the reason they  continued— why it became a \n habit— was because of a speciﬁ  c reward they started to crave.\nIn one group, 92 percent of people said they habitually exercised \nbecause it made them “feel good”—they grew to expect and crave the endorphins and other neurochemicals a workout provided. In another group, 67 percent of people said that working out gave them a sense of “accomplishment”—they had come to crave a regular sense of triumph from tracking their performances, and that  self- reward was enough to make the physical activity into a habit.\nIf you want to start running each morning, it’s essential that you \nchoose a simple cue (like always lacing up your sneakers before breakfast or leaving your running clothes next to your bed) and a clear reward (such as a midday treat, a sense of accomplishment from recording your miles, or the endorphin rush you get from a jog). But countless studies have shown that a cue and a reward, on their own, aren ’t enough for a new habit to last",

    "text": ". Only when your brain starts expecting  the  reward— craving the endorphins or sense \nof  accomplishment— will it become automatic to lace up your jog-ging shoes each morning. The cue, in addition to triggering a rou-tine, must also trigger a craving for the reward to come.\n“Let me ask you about a problem I have,” I said to Wolfram Schultz, \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   51 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   51 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n52 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nthe neuroscientist, after he explained to me how craving emerges. “I \nhave a  two- year- old, and when I’m home feeding him  dinner— chicken nuggets and stuff like  that— I’ll reach over and eat one myself without thinking about it. It’s a habit. And now I’m gaining weight.”\n“Everybody does that,” Schultz said. He has three children of his \nown, all adults now. When they were young, he would pick at their din-ners unthinkingly. “In some ways,” he told me, “we’re like the mon-keys. When we see the chicken or fries on the table, our brains begin anticipating that food, even if we’re not hungry. Our brains are craving them. Frankly, I don ’t even like this kind of food, but suddenly, it’s hard \nto ﬁ ght this urge. And as soon as I eat it, I feel this rush of pleasure as \nthe craving is satisﬁ  ed. It’s humiliating, but that’s how habits work.\n“I guess I should be thankful,” he said, “because the same pro-\ncess has let me create good habits. I work hard because I expect pride from a discovery. I exercise because I expect feeling good after-ward. I just wish I could pick and choose better.”\nIV.\nAfter their disastrous interview with the cat woman, Drake Stimson ’s team at P&G started looking outside the usual channels for help. They began reading up on experiments such as those conducted by Wol-fram Schultz. They asked a Harvard Business School professor to con-duct psychological tests of Febreze’s ad campaigns. They interviewed customer after customer, looking for something that would give them a clue as to how to make Febreze a regular part of consumers’ lives.Routine\nReward Cue SmokesCRAVING \nFOR ENDORPHIN\nRUSH OR \nACCOMPLISHMENT\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   52 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   52 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Craving Brain ● 53\nOne day, they went to speak with a woman in a suburb near \nScottsdale. She was in her forties with four kids. Her house was clean, but not compulsively tidy. To the surprise of the researchers, she loved Febreze.\n“I use it every day,” she told them.“You do?” Stimson said. The house didn ’t seem like the kind of \nplace with smelly problems. There weren ’t any pets. No one smoked. “How? What smells are you trying to get rid of?”\n“I don ’t really use it for speciﬁ  c smells,” the woman said. “I mean, \nyou know, I’ve got boys. They’re going through puberty, and if I don ’t clean their rooms, it smells like a locker. But I don ’t really use it that way. I use it for normal  cleaning— a couple of sprays when I’m done in a room. It’s a nice way to make everything smell good as a ﬁ  nal touch.”\nThey asked if they could watch her clean the house. In the bed-\nroom, she made her bed, plumped the pillows, tightened the sheet’s corners, and then took a Febreze bottle and sprayed the unwrinkled comforter. In the living room, she vacuumed, picked up the kids’ shoes, straightened the coffee table, and sprayed Febreze on the freshly cleaned carpet. “It’s nice, you know?” she said. “Spraying feels like a little  mini- celebration when I’m done with a room.” At the rate she was using Febreze, Stimson estimated, she would empty a bottle every two weeks.\nP&G had collected thousands of hours of videotapes of people \ncleaning their homes over the years. When the researchers got back to Cincinnati, some of them spent an evening looking through the tapes.",

The cue, in addition to triggering a rou-tine, must also trigger a craving for the reward to come.\n“Let me ask you about a problem I have,” I said to Wolfram Schultz, \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   51 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   51 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n52 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nthe neuroscientist, after he explained to me how craving emerges. “I \nhave a  two- year- old, and when I’m home feeding him  dinner— chicken nuggets and stuff like  that— I’ll reach over and eat one myself without thinking about it. It’s a habit. And now I’m gaining weight.”\n“Everybody does that,” Schultz said. He has three children of his \nown, all adults now. When they were young, he would pick at their din-ners unthinkingly. “In some ways,” he told me, “we’re like the mon-keys. When we see the chicken or fries on the table, our brains begin anticipating that food, even if we’re not hungry. Our brains are craving them. Frankly, I don ’t even like this kind of food, but suddenly, it’s hard \nto ﬁ ght this urge. And as soon as I eat it, I feel this rush of pleasure as \nthe craving is satisﬁ  ed. It’s humiliating, but that’s how habits work.\n“I guess I should be thankful,” he said, “because the same pro-\ncess has let me create good habits. I work hard because I expect pride from a discovery. I exercise because I expect feeling good after-ward. I just wish I could pick and choose better.”\nIV.\nAfter their disastrous interview with the cat woman, Drake Stimson ’s team at P&G started looking outside the usual channels for help. They began reading up on experiments such as those conducted by Wol-fram Schultz. They asked a Harvard Business School professor to con-duct psychological tests of Febreze’s ad campaigns. They interviewed customer after customer, looking for something that would give",

When they were young, he would pick at their din-ners unthinkingly. “In some ways,” he told me, “we’re like the mon-keys. When we see the chicken or fries on the table, our brains begin anticipating that food, even if we’re not hungry. Our brains are craving them. Frankly, I don ’t even like this kind of food, but suddenly, it’s hard \nto ﬁ ght this urge. And as soon as I eat it, I feel this rush of pleasure as \nthe craving is satisﬁ  ed. It’s humiliating, but that’s how habits work.\n“I guess I should be thankful,” he said, “because the same pro-\ncess has let me create good habits. I work hard because I expect pride from a discovery. I exercise because I expect feeling good after-ward. I just wish I could pick and choose better.”\nIV.\nAfter their disastrous interview with the cat woman, Drake Stimson ’s team at P&G started looking outside the usual channels for help",

They asked a Harvard Business School professor to con-duct psychological tests of Febreze’s ad campaigns. They interviewed customer after customer, looking for something that would give them a clue as to how to make Febreze a regular part of consumers’ lives.Routine\nReward Cue SmokesCRAVING \nFOR ENDORPHIN\nRUSH OR \nACCOMPLISHMENT\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   52 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   52 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Craving Brain ● 53\nOne day, they went to speak with a woman in a suburb near \nScottsdale.

To the surprise of the researchers, she loved Febreze.\n“I use it every day,” she told them.“You do?” Stimson said. The house didn ’t seem like the kind of \nplace with smelly problems. There weren ’t any pets. No one smoked. “How? What smells are you trying to get rid of?”\n“I don ’t really use it for speciﬁ  c smells,” the woman said. “I mean, \nyou know, I’ve got boys. They’re going through puberty, and if I don ’t clean their rooms, it smells like a locker. But I don ’t really use it that way. I use it for normal  cleaning— a couple of sprays when I’m done in a room. It’s a nice way to make everything smell good as a ﬁ  nal touch.”\nThey asked if they could watch her clean the house. In the bed-\nroom, she made her bed, plumped the pillows, tightened the sheet’s corners, and then took a Febreze bottle and sprayed the unwrinkled comforter. In the living room, she vacuumed, picked up the kids’ shoes, straightened the coffee table, and sprayed Febreze on the freshly cleaned carpet. “It’s nice, you know?” she said. “Spraying feels like a little  mini- celebration when I’m done with a room.” At the rate she was using Febreze, Stimson estimated,",

The house didn ’t seem like the kind of \nplace with smelly problems. There weren ’t any pets. No one smoked. “How? What smells are you trying to get rid of?”\n“I don ’t really use it for speciﬁ  c smells,” the woman said. “I mean, \nyou know, I’ve got boys. They’re going through puberty, and if I don ’t clean their rooms, it smells like a locker. But I don ’t really use it that way. I use it for normal  cleaning— a couple of sprays when I’m done in a room. It’s a nice way to make everything smell good as a ﬁ  nal touch.”\nThey asked if they could watch her clean the house. In the bed-\nroom, she made her bed, plumped the pillows, tightened the sheet’s corners, and then took a Febreze bottle and sprayed the unwrinkled comforter. In the living room, she vacuumed, picked up the kids’ shoes, straightened the coffee table, and sprayed Febreze",

    "text": " she would empty a bottle every two weeks.\nP&G had collected thousands of hours of videotapes of people \ncleaning their homes over the years. When the researchers got back to Cincinnati, some of them spent an evening looking through the tapes. The next morning, one of the scientists asked the entire Fe-breze team to join him in the conference room. He cued up the tape of one  woman— a  twenty- six- year- old with three  children— making a bed. She smoothed the sheets and adjusted a pillow. Then, she smiled and left the room.\n“Did you see that?” the researcher asked excitedly.He put on another clip. A younger, brunette woman spread out a \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   53 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   53 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n54 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\ncolorful bedspread, straightened a pillow, and then smiled at her \nhandiwork. “There it is again!” the researcher said. The next clip showed a woman in workout clothes tidying her kitchen and wiping the counter before easing into a relaxing stretch.\nThe researcher looked at his colleagues.“Do you see it?” he asked.“Each of them is doing something relaxing or happy when they \nﬁ nish cleaning,” he said. “We can build off that! What if Febreze \nwas something that happened at the end of the cleaning routine, \nrather than the beginning? What if it was the fun part of making something cleaner?”\nStimson ’s team ran one more test. Previously, the product’s ad-\nvertising had focused on eliminating bad smells. The company printed up new labels that showed open windows and gusts of fresh air. More perfume was added to the recipe, so that instead of merely neutralizing odors, Febreze had its own distinct scent. Television commercials were ﬁ  lmed of women spraying freshly made beds \nand spritzing  just- laundered clothing. The tagline had been “Gets bad smells out of fabrics.” It was rewritten as “Cleans life’s smells.”\nEach change was designed to appeal to a speciﬁ  c, daily cue: \nCleaning a room. Making a bed. Vacuuming a rug. In each one, Febreze was positioned as the reward: the nice smell that occurs at the end of a cleaning routine. Most important, each ad was cali-brated to elicit a craving: that things will smell as nice as they look when the cleaning ritual is done. The irony is that a product manu-factured to destroy odors was transformed into the opposite. Instead of eliminating scents on dirty fabrics, it became an air freshener used as the ﬁ  nishing touch, once things are already clean.\nWhen the researchers went back into consumers’ homes after \nthe new ads aired and the redesigned bottles were given away, they found that some housewives in the test market had started  expecting— craving— the Febreze scent. One woman said that when her bottle ran dry, she squirted diluted perfume on her laundry. “If \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   54 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   54 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Craving Brain ● 55\nI don ’t smell something nice at the end, it doesn ’t really seem clean \nnow,” she told them.\n“The park ranger with the skunk problem sent us in the wrong \ndirection,” Stimson told me. “She made us think that Febreze would succeed by providing a solution to a problem. But who wants to admit their house stinks?\n“We were looking at it all wrong. No one craves scentlessness. \nOn the other hand, lots of people crave a nice smell after they’ve spent thirty minutes cleaning.”\nThe Febreze relaunch took place in the summer of 1998. Within \ntwo months, sales doubled. Within a year, customers had spent more than $230 million on the product. Since then, Febreze has spawned dozens of  spin- offs— air fresheners, candles, laundry detergents, and kitchen  sprays— that, all told, now account for sales of more than $1 billion per year. Eventually, P&G began mentioning to customers that, in addition to smelling good, Febreze can also kill bad odors.\nStimson was promoted and his team received their bonuses. The \nformula had worked. They had found simple and obvious cues. They had clearly deﬁ  ned the reward.\nBut only once they",

When the researchers got back to Cincinnati, some of them spent an evening looking through the tapes. The next morning, one of the scientists asked the entire Fe-breze team to join him in the conference room. He cued up the tape of one  woman— a  twenty- six- year- old with three  children— making a bed. She smoothed the sheets and adjusted a pillow. Then, she smiled and left the room.\n“Did you see that?” the researcher asked excitedly.He put on another clip. A younger, brunette woman spread out a \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   53 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   53 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n54 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\ncolorful bedspread, straightened a pillow, and then smiled at her \nhandiwork. “There it is again!” the researcher said. The next clip showed a woman in workout clothes tidying her kitchen and wiping the counter before easing into a relaxing stretch.\nThe researcher looked at his colleagues.“Do you see it?” he asked.“Each of them is doing something relaxing or happy when they \nﬁ nish cleaning,” he said. “We can build off that! What if Febreze \nwas something that happened at the end of the cleaning routine, \nrather than the beginning? What if it was the fun part of making something cleaner?”\nStimson ’s team ran one more test. Previously, the product’s ad-\nvertising had focused on eliminating bad smells. The company printed up new labels that showed open windows and gusts of fresh air. More perfume was added to the recipe, so that instead of merely neutralizing odors, Febreze had its own distinct scent. Television commercials were ﬁ  lmed of women spraying freshly made beds \nand spritzing  just- laundered clothing. The tagline had been “Gets bad smells out of fabrics.” It was rewritten as “Cleans life’s smells.”\nEach change was designed to appeal to a speciﬁ  c, daily cue: \nCleaning a room. Making a bed. Vacuuming a rug. In each one, Febreze",

The next clip showed a woman in workout clothes tidying her kitchen and wiping the counter before easing into a relaxing stretch.\nThe researcher looked at his colleagues.“Do you see it?” he asked.“Each of them is doing something relaxing or happy when they \nﬁ nish cleaning,” he said. “We can build off that! What if Febreze \nwas something that happened at the end of the cleaning routine, \nrather than the beginning? What if it was the fun part of making something cleaner?”\nStimson ’s team ran one more test. Previously, the product’s ad-\nvertising had focused on eliminating bad smells. The company printed up new labels that showed open windows and gusts of fresh air. More perfume was added to the recipe, so that instead of merely neutralizing odors, Febreze had its own distinct scent. Television commercials were ﬁ  lmed of women spraying freshly made beds \nand spritzing  just- laundered clothing. The tagline had been “Gets bad smells out of fabrics.”",

    "text": " It was rewritten as “Cleans life’s smells.”\nEach change was designed to appeal to a speciﬁ  c, daily cue: \nCleaning a room. Making a bed. Vacuuming a rug. In each one, Febreze was positioned as the reward: the nice smell that occurs at the end of a cleaning routine. Most important, each ad was cali-brated to elicit a craving: that things will smell as nice as they look when the cleaning ritual is done. The irony is that a product manu-factured to destroy odors was transformed into the opposite. Instead of eliminating scents on dirty fabrics, it became an air freshener used as the ﬁ  nishing touch, once things are already clean.\nWhen the researchers went back into consumers’ homes after \nthe new ads aired and the redesigned bottles were given away, they found that some housewives in the test market had started  expecting— craving— the Febreze scent. One woman said that when her bottle ran dry, she squirted diluted perfume on her laundry. “If \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   54 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   54 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Craving Brain ● 55\nI don ’t smell something nice at the end, it doesn ’t really seem clean \nnow,” she told them.\n“The park ranger with the skunk problem sent us in the wrong \ndirection,” Stimson told me. “She made us think that Febreze would succeed by providing a solution to a problem. But who wants to admit their house stinks?\n“We were looking at it all wrong. No one craves scentlessness. \nOn the other hand, lots of people crave a nice smell after they’ve spent thirty minutes cleaning.”\nThe Febreze relaunch took place in the summer of 1998. Within \ntwo months, sales doubled. Within a year, customers had spent more than $230 million on the product. Since then, Febreze has spawned dozens of  spin- offs— air fresheners, candles, laundry detergents, and kitchen  sprays— that, all told, now account for sales of more than $1 billion per year. Eventually, P&G began mentioning to customers that, in addition to smelling good,",

    "text": " It was rewritten as “Cleans life’s smells.”\nEach change was designed to appeal to a speciﬁ  c, daily cue: \nCleaning a room. Making a bed. Vacuuming a rug. In each one, Febreze was positioned as the reward: the nice smell that occurs at the end of a cleaning routine. Most important, each ad was cali-brated to elicit a craving: that things will smell as nice as they look when the cleaning ritual is done. The irony is that a product manu-factured to destroy odors was transformed into the opposite. Instead of eliminating scents on dirty fabrics, it became an air freshener used as the ﬁ  nishing touch, once things are already clean.\nWhen the researchers went back into consumers’ homes after \nthe new ads aired and the redesigned bottles were given away, they found that some housewives in the test market had started  expecting— craving— the Febreze scent. One woman said that when her bottle ran dry, she squirted diluted perfume on her laundry. “If \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   54 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j",

They had clearly deﬁ  ned the reward.\nBut only once they created a sense of  craving— the desire to make \neverything smell as nice as it  looked— did Febreze become a hit. That craving is an essential part of the formula for creating new habits that Claude Hopkins, the Pepsodent ad man, never recognized.CRAVING \nFOR A CLEAN \nSCENT\nTHE FEBREZE HABIT LOOPRoutine\nReward Cue\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   55 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   55 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n56 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nV.\nIn his ﬁ  nal years of life, Hopkins took to the lecture circuit. His talks \non the “Laws of Scientiﬁ  c Advertising” attracted thousands of peo-\nple. From stages, he often compared himself to Thomas Edison and George Washington and spun out wild forecasts about the future (ﬂ ying automobiles featured prominently). But he never mentioned \ncravings or the neurological roots of the habit loop. After all, it would be another seventy years before the MIT scientists and Wolfram Schultz conducted their experiments.\nSo how did Hopkins manage to build such a powerful tooth-\nbrushing habit without the beneﬁ  t of those insights?\nWell, it turns out that he actually did take advantage of the prin-\nciples eventually discovered at MIT and inside Schultz’s laboratory, even if nobody knew it at the time.\nHopkins’s experiences with Pepsodent weren ’t quite as straight-\nforward as he portrays them in his memoirs. Though he boasted that he discovered an amazing cue in tooth ﬁ  lm, and bragged that \nhe was the ﬁ  rst to offer consumers the clear reward of beautiful \nteeth, it turns out that Hopkins wasn ’t the originator of those tactics. Not by a long shot. Consider, for instance, some of the advertise-ments for other toothpastes that ﬁ  lled magazines and newspapers \neven before Hopkins knew that Pepsodent existed.\n“The ingredients of this preparation are especially intended to \nprevent deposits of tartar  from accumulating around the necks of \nthe teeth,” read an ad for Dr. Shefﬁ  eld’s Crème Dentifrice that pre-\ndated Pepsodent. “Clean that dirty layer!”\n“Your white enamel is only hidden by a coating of ﬁ  lm,” read an \nadvertisement that appeared while Hopkins was looking through his dental textbooks. “Sanitol Tooth Paste quickly restores the origi-nal whiteness by removing ﬁ  lm.”\n“The charm of a lovely smile depends upon the beauty of your \nteeth,” proclaimed a third ad. “Beautiful, satin smooth teeth are \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   56 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   56 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Craving Brain ● 57\noften the secret of a pretty girl’s attractiveness. Use S.S. White Tooth-\npaste!”\nDozens of other advertising men had used the same language as \nPepsodent years before  Hopkins jumped in the game. All of their \nads had promised to remove tooth ﬁ  lm and had offered the reward \nof beautiful, white teeth. None of them had worked.\nBut once Hopkins launched his campaign, sales of Pepsodent \nexploded. Why was Pepsodent different?\nBecause Hopkins’s success was driven by the same factors that \ncaused Julio the monkey to touch the lever and housewives to spray Febreze on freshly made beds. Pepsodent created a craving.\nHopkins doesn ’t spend any of his autobiography discussing the \ningredients in Pepsodent, but the recipe listed on the toothpaste’s patent application and company records reveals something inter-esting: Unlike other pastes of the period, Pepsodent contained citric acid, as well as doses of mint oil and other chemicals. Pepso-dent’s inventor used those ingredients to make the toothpaste taste fresh, but they had another, unanticipated effect as well. They’re irritants that create a cool, tingling sensation on the tongue and gums.\nAfter Pepsodent started dominating the marketplace, research-\ners at competing companies scrambled to ﬁ  gure out why. What they \nfound was that customers said that if they forgot to use Pepsodent",

They had clearly deﬁ  ned the reward.\nBut only once they created a sense of  craving— the desire to make \neverything smell as nice as it  looked— did Febreze become a hit. That craving is an essential part of the formula for creating new habits that Claude Hopkins, the Pepsodent ad man, never recognized.CRAVING \nFOR A CLEAN \nSCENT\nTHE FEBREZE HABIT LOOPRoutine\nReward Cue\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   55 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   55 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n56 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nV.\nIn his ﬁ  nal years of life, Hopkins took to the lecture circuit. His talks \non the “Laws of Scientiﬁ  c Advertising” attracted thousands of peo-\nple. From stages, he often compared himself to Thomas Edison and George Washington and spun out wild forecasts about the future (ﬂ ying automobiles featured prominently). But he never mentioned \ncravings or the neurological roots of the habit loop. After all, it would be another seventy years before the MIT scientists and Wolfram Schultz conducted their experiments.\nSo how did Hopkins manage to build such a powerful tooth-\nbrushing habit without the beneﬁ  t of those insights?\nWell, it turns out that he actually did take advantage of the prin-\nciples eventually discovered at MIT and inside Schultz’s laboratory, even if nobody knew it at the time.\nHopkins’s experiences with Pepsodent weren ’t quite as straight-\nforward as he portrays them in his memoirs. Though he boasted that he discovered an amazing cue in tooth ﬁ  lm, and bragged that \nhe was the ﬁ  rst to offer consumers the clear reward of beautiful \nteeth, it turns out that Hopkins wasn ’t the originator of those tactics. Not by a long shot. Consider, for instance, some of the advertise-ments for other toothpastes that ﬁ  lled magazines and newspapers \neven before Hopkins knew that Pepsodent existed.\n“The ingredients of this preparation are especially intended",

    "text": "V.\nIn his ﬁ  nal years of life, Hopkins took to the lecture circuit. His talks \non the “Laws of Scientiﬁ  c Advertising” attracted thousands of peo-\nple. From stages, he often compared himself to Thomas Edison and George Washington and spun out wild forecasts about the future (ﬂ ying automobiles featured prominently). But he never mentioned \ncravings or the neurological roots of the habit loop. After all, it would be another seventy years before the MIT scientists and Wolfram Schultz conducted their experiments.\nSo how did Hopkins manage to build such a powerful tooth-\nbrushing habit without the beneﬁ  t of those insights?\nWell, it turns out that he actually did take advantage of the prin-\nciples eventually discovered at MIT and inside Schultz’s laboratory, even if nobody knew it at the time.\nHopkins’s experiences with Pepsodent weren ’t quite as straight-\nforward as he portrays them in his memoirs. Though he boasted that he discovered an amazing cue in tooth ﬁ  lm, and bragged that \nhe was the ﬁ  rst to offer consumers the clear reward of beautiful \nteeth, it turns out that Hopkins wasn ’t the originator of those tactics.

Consider, for instance, some of the advertise-ments for other toothpastes that ﬁ  lled magazines and newspapers \neven before Hopkins knew that Pepsodent existed.\n“The ingredients of this preparation are especially intended to \nprevent deposits of tartar  from accumulating around the necks of \nthe teeth,” read an ad for Dr. Shefﬁ  eld’s Crème Dentifrice that pre-\ndated Pepsodent. “Clean that dirty layer!”\n“Your white enamel is only hidden by a coating of ﬁ  lm,” read an \nadvertisement that appeared while Hopkins was looking through his dental textbooks. “Sanitol Tooth Paste quickly restores the origi-nal whiteness by removing ﬁ  lm.”\n“The charm of a lovely smile depends upon the beauty of your \nteeth,” proclaimed a third ad. “Beautiful, satin smooth teeth are \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   56 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   56 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Craving Brain ● 57\noften the secret of a pretty girl’s attractiveness. Use S.S. White Tooth-\npaste!”\nDozens of other advertising men had used the same language as \nPepsodent years before  Hopkins jumped in the game. All of their \nads had promised to remove tooth ﬁ  lm and had offered the reward \nof beautiful, white teeth. None of them had worked.\nBut once Hopkins launched his campaign, sales of Pepsodent \nexploded. Why was Pepsodent different?\nBecause Hopkins’s success was driven by the same factors that \ncaused Julio the monkey to touch the lever and housewives to spray Febreze on freshly made beds. Pepsodent created a craving.\nHopkins doesn ’t spend any of his autobiography discussing the \ningredients in Pepsodent, but the recipe listed on the toothpaste’s patent application and company records reveals something inter-esting: Unlike other pastes of the period, Pepsodent contained citric acid, as well as doses of mint oil and other chemicals. Pepso-dent’s inventor used those ingredients to make the toothpaste taste fresh, but they had another, unanticipated effect as well. They’re irritants that create a cool, tingling sensation",

What they \nfound was that customers said that if they forgot to use Pepsodent, they realized their mistake because they missed that cool, tingling sensation in their mouths. They  expected— they  craved— that slight \nirritation. If it wasn ’t there, their mouths didn ’t feel clean.\nClaude Hopkins wasn ’t selling beautiful teeth. He was selling a \nsensation. Once people craved that cool  tingling— once they equated it with  cleanliness— brushing became a habit.\nWhen other companies discovered what Hopkins was really sell-\ning, they started imitating him. Within a few decades, almost every toothpaste contained oils and chemicals that caused gums to tingle. Soon, Pepsodent started getting outsold. Even today, almost all \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   57 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   57 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n58 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\ntoothpastes contain additives with the sole job of making your \nmouth tingle after you brush.\n“Consumers need some kind of signal that a product is working,” \nTracy Sinclair, who was a brand manager for  Oral- B and Crest Kids Toothpaste, told me. “We can make toothpaste taste like  anything— blueberries, green  tea— and as long as it has a cool tingle, people feel like their mouth is clean. The tingling doesn ’t make the toothpaste work any better. It just convinces people it’s doing the job.”\nAnyone can use this basic formula to create habits of her or his \nown. Want to exercise more? Choose a cue, such as going to the gym as soon as you wake up, and a reward, such as a smoothie after each workout. Then think about that smoothie, or about the endorphin rush you’ll feel. Allow yourself to anticipate the reward. Eventually, that craving will make it easier to push through the gym doors every day.\nWant to craft a new eating habit? When researchers afﬁ  liated \nwith the National Weight Control  Registry— a project involving more than six thousand people who have lost more than thirty  pounds— looked at the habits of successful dieters, they found that 78 percent of them ate breakfast every morning, a meal cued by a time of day. But most of the successful dieters also envisioned a spe-\nciﬁ c reward for sticking with their  diet— a bikini they wanted to \nwear or the sense of pride they felt when they stepped on the scale each  day— something they chose carefully and really wanted. They focused on the craving for that reward when temptations arose, cul-Routine\nReward CueCRAVING \nFOR TINGLING\nSENSATION\nTHE REAL PEPSODENT HABIT LOOP\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   58 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   58 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Craving Brain ● 59\ntivated the craving into a mild obsession. And their cravings for that \nreward, researchers found, crowded out the temptation to drop the diet. The craving drove the habit loop.\nFor companies, understanding the science of cravings is revolu-\ntionary. There are dozens of daily rituals we ought  to perform each \nday that never become habits. We should watch our salt and drink more water. We should eat more vegetables and fewer fats. We should take vitamins and apply sunscreen. The facts could not be more clear on this last front: Dabbing a bit of sunscreen on your face each morning signiﬁ  cantly lowers the odds of skin cancer. Yet, \nwhile everyone brushes their teeth, fewer than 10 percent of Ameri-cans apply sunscreen each day. Why?\nBecause there’s no craving that has made sunscreen into a daily \nhabit. Some companies are trying to ﬁ  x that by giving sunscreens a \ntingling sensation or something that lets people know they’ve applied it to their skin. They’re hoping it will cue an expectation the same way the craving for a tingling mouth reminds us to brush our teeth. They’ve already used similar tactics in hundreds of other products.\n“Foaming is a huge reward,” said Sinclair, the brand manager. \n“Shampoo doesn ’t have to foam, but we add foaming chemicals be-cause people expect it each time they wash their hair.

What they \nfound was that customers said that if they forgot to use Pepsodent, they realized their mistake because they missed that cool, tingling sensation in their mouths. They  expected— they  craved— that slight \nirritation. If it wasn ’t there, their mouths didn ’t feel clean.\nClaude Hopkins wasn ’t selling beautiful teeth. He was selling a \nsensation.

Want to exercise more? Choose a cue, such as going to the gym as soon as you wake up, and a reward, such as a smoothie after each workout. Then think about that smoothie, or about the endorphin rush you’ll feel. Allow yourself to anticipate the reward.

The tingling doesn ’t make the toothpaste work any better. It just convinces people it’s doing the job.”\nAnyone can use this basic formula to create habits of her or his \nown. Want to exercise more? Choose a cue, such as going to the gym as soon as you wake up, and a reward, such as a smoothie after each workout. Then think about that smoothie, or about the endorphin rush you’ll feel. Allow yourself",

When researchers afﬁ  liated \nwith the National Weight Control  Registry— a project involving more than six thousand people who have lost more than thirty  pounds— looked at the habits of successful dieters, they found that 78 percent of them ate breakfast every morning, a meal cued by a time of day. But most of the successful dieters also envisioned a spe-\nciﬁ c reward for sticking with their  diet— a bikini they wanted to \nwear or the sense of pride they felt when they stepped on the scale each  day— something they chose carefully and really wanted.

There are dozens of daily rituals we ought  to perform each \nday that never become habits. We should watch our salt and drink more water. We should eat more vegetables and fewer fats. We should take vitamins and apply sunscreen. The facts could not be more clear on this last front: Dabbing a bit of sunscreen on your face each morning signiﬁ  cantly lowers the odds of skin cancer. Yet, \nwhile everyone brushes their teeth, fewer than 10 percent of Ameri-cans apply sunscreen each day. Why?\nBecause there’s no craving that has made sunscreen into a daily \nhabit. Some companies are trying to ﬁ  x that by giving sunscreens a \ntingling sensation or something that lets people know they’ve applied it to their skin. They’re hoping it will cue an expectation the same way the craving for a tingling mouth reminds us to brush our teeth. They’ve already used similar tactics in hundreds of other",
