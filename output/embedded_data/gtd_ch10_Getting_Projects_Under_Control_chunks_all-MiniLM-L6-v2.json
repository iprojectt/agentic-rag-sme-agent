That's the horizontal level—what needs you r attention \nand action across the horizontal landscape of your life. The last \npiece of the puzzle is the vertical level—the diggi ng deep and pie- \nin-the-sky thinking that can leverage your creative  brainpower. \nThat gets us back to refining and energizing our pr oject planning. \nThe Need for More Informal Planning \nAfter years of working with thousands of profession als down in \nthe trenches, I can safely say that virtually all o f us could be doing \nmore planning, more informally and more often, abou t our proj- \nects and our lives. And if we did, it would relieve  a lot of pressure \non our psyches and produce an enormous amount of cr eative out- \nput with minimal effort. \nI've discovered that the biggest improvement opport unity in \nplanning does not consist of techniques for the hig hly elaborate \nand complex kinds of project organizing that profes sional project \nmanagers sometimes use (like GANTT charts). Most of  the peo- \nple who need those already have them, or at least h ave access to \nthe training and software required to learn about t hem. The real \nneed is to capture and utilize more of the creative , proactive \nthinking we do—or could do. \n211 \nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  |  PART TWO \nThe major reason for the lack of this kind of effec tive value- \nadded thinking is the dearth of systems for managin g the poten- \ntially infinite amount of detail that could show up\nas a result. This is why my approach tends to be \nbottom-up. If you feel out of control with your cur - \nrent actionable commitments, you'll resist focused \nplanning. An unconscious pushback occurs. As you \nbegin to apply these methods, however, you may find\nthat they free up enormous creative and constructiv e \nthinking. If you have systems and habits ready to \nleverage your ideas, your productivity can expand e xponentially. \nIn chapter 3, I covered in some detail the five pha ses of proj- \nect planning that take something from the idea stag e into physical \nreality. \nWhat follows is a compilation of practical tips \nand techniques to facilitate the natural, informal \nplanning processes I recommend. Although these \nsuggestions are all based on common sense, they're \nnot followed nearly as frequently as they could be.\nPut them to use whenever and as often as you can, \ninstead of saving up your thinking for big formal \nmeetings. \n212 Which Projects Should You Be Planning? \nMost of the outcomes you have identified for your \" Projects\" list \nwill not need any kind of front-end planning, other  than the sort \nyou do in your head, quickly and naturally, to come  up with a next \naction on them. The only planning needed for \"Get c ar \ninspected,\" for example, would be to decide to chec k the phone \nbook for the nearest inspection location and call a nd set up a time. \nThere are two types of projects, however, that dese rve at least \nsome sort of planning activity: (1) those that stil l have your atten- \ntion even after you've determined their next action s, and (2) those The middle of \nevery successful \nproject looks like a \ndisaster. \n—Rosabeth \nMoss \nYou need to set up \nsystems and tricks \nthat get you to think \nabout your projects \nand situations more \nfrequently, more \neasily, and in more \ndepth. \nCHAPTER 10  |  GETTING PROJECTS UNDER CONTROL \nabout which potentially useful ideas and supportive  detail just \nshow up. \nThe first type—the projects that you know have othe r things \nabout them that must be decided on and organized—wi ll need a \nmore detailed approach than just identifying a next  action. For \nthese you'll need a more specific application of on e or more of the \nother four phases of the natural planning model: pu rpose and \nprinciples, vision/outcome, brainstorming, and/or o rganizing. \nThe second type—the projects for which ideas just s how up, \nad hoc, on a beach or in a car or in a meeting—need  to have an \nappropriate place into which these associated ideas  can be cap- \ntured. Then they can reside there for later use as needed. \nProjects That Need Next Actions About Planning \nThere are probably a few projects you can think of right now, off \nthe top of your head, that you know you want to get ",

    "text": "Getting Projects Under Control \nCHAPTERS 4 THROUGH 9 have given you all the tricks and methods you \nneed to clear your head and make intuitive choices about what to \ndo when. That's the horizontal level—what needs you r attention \nand action across the horizontal landscape of your life. The last \npiece of the puzzle is the vertical level—the diggi ng deep and pie- \nin-the-sky thinking that can leverage your creative  brainpower. \nThat gets us back to refining and energizing our pr oject planning. \nThe Need for More Informal Planning \nAfter years of working with thousands of profession als down in \nthe trenches, I can safely say that virtually all o f us could be doing \nmore planning, more informally and more often, abou t our proj- \nects and our lives. And if we did, it would relieve  a lot of pressure \non our psyches and produce an enormous amount of cr eative out- \nput with minimal effort. \nI've discovered that the biggest improvement opport unity in \nplanning does not consist of techniques for the hig hly elaborate \nand complex kinds of project organizing that profes sional project \nmanagers sometimes use (like GANTT charts). Most of  the peo- \nple who need those already have them, or at least h ave access to \nthe training and software required to learn about t hem. The real \nneed is to capture and utilize more of the creative , proactive \nthinking we do—or could do. \n211 \nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  |  PART TWO \nThe major reason for the lack of this kind of effec tive value- \nadded thinking is the dearth of systems for managin g the poten- \ntially infinite amount of detail that could show up\nas a result. This is why my approach tends to be \nbottom-up. If you feel out of control with your cur - \nrent actionable commitments, you'll resist focused \nplanning. An unconscious pushback occurs. As you \nbegin to apply these methods, however, you may find\nthat they free up enormous creative and constructiv e \nthinking. If you have systems and habits ready to \nleverage your ideas, your productivity can expand e xponentially. \nIn chapter 3, I covered in some detail the five pha ses of proj- \nect planning that take something from the idea stag e into physical \nreality. \n",

The last \npiece of the puzzle is the vertical level—the diggi ng deep and pie- \nin-the-sky thinking that can leverage your creative  brainpower. \nThat gets us back to refining and energizing our pr oject planning. \nThe Need for More Informal Planning \nAfter years of working with thousands of profession als down in \nthe trenches, I can safely say that virtually all o f us could be doing \nmore planning, more informally and more often, abou t our proj- \nects and our lives. And if we did, it would relieve  a lot of pressure \non our psyches and produce an enormous amount of cr eative out- \nput with minimal effort. \nI've discovered that the biggest improvement opport unity in \nplanning does not consist of techniques for the hig hly elaborate \nand complex kinds of project organizing that profes sional project \nmanagers sometimes use (like GANTT charts).",

Although these \nsuggestions are all based on common sense, they're \nnot followed nearly as frequently as they could be.\nPut them to use whenever and as often as you can, \ninstead of saving up your thinking for big formal \nmeetings. \n212 Which Projects Should You Be Planning? \nMost of the outcomes you have identified for your \" Projects\" list \nwill not need any kind of front-end planning, other  than the sort \nyou do in your head, quickly and naturally, to come  up with a next \naction on them. The only planning needed for \"Get c ar \ninspected,\" for example, would be to decide to chec k the phone \nbook for the nearest inspection location and call a nd set up a time. \nThere are two types of projects, however, that dese rve at least \nsome sort of planning activity: (1) those that stil l have your atten- \ntion even after you've determined their next action s, and (2) those The middle of \nevery successful \nproject looks like a \ndisaster. \n—Rosabeth \nMoss \nYou need to set up \nsystems and tricks \nthat get you to think \nabout your projects \nand situations more \nfrequently, more \neasily, and in more \ndepth. \nCHAPTER 10  |  GETTING PROJECTS UNDER CONTROL \nabout which potentially useful ideas and supportive  detail just \nshow up. \nThe first type—the projects that you know have othe r things \nabout them that must be decided on and organized—wi ll need a \nmore detailed approach than just identifying a next  action. For \nthese you'll need a more specific application of on e or more of the \nother four phases of the natural planning model: pu rpose and \nprinciples, vision/outcome, brainstorming, and/or o rganizing. \nThe second type—the projects for which ideas just s how up, \nad hoc, on a beach or in a car or in a meeting—need  to have an \nappropriate place into which these associated ideas  can be cap- \ntured",

Then they can reside there for later use as needed. \nProjects That Need Next Actions About Planning \nThere are probably a few projects you can think of right now, off \nthe top of your head, that you know you want to get  more objecti- \nfied, fleshed out, and under control. Perhaps you h ave an impor- \ntant meeting coming up and you know you have to pre pare an \nagenda and materials for it. Or you've just inherit ed the job of \ncoordinating the annual associates' conference, and  you've got to \nget it organized as soon as possible so you can sta rt delegating sig- \nnificant pieces. Or you've got to clarify a job des cription for a new \nposition on your team to give to Human Resources. I f you haven't \ndone it already, get a next action now that will start the planning \nprocess for each of these, and put it on the approp riate action list. \nThen proceed with further planning steps. \nTypical Planning Steps \nThe most common types of planning-oriented actions will be \nyour own brainstorming and organizing, setting up m eetings, and \ngathering information. \nBrainstorming Some of the projects that have your attention \nright now will require you to do your own free-form  thinking; this \nis especially true of those for which you were not clear about what \n213 \nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY | PART TWO \nthe next action would be when you made that decisio n. These \nshould all have a next action, such as \"Draft ideas  re X.\" \nYou need to decide where and how you want to do tha t \naction, in order to know which action list to put i t on. Do you do \nthis kind of thinking best on a computer, or by han d-writing your \nthoughts on paper? I may choose either medium, depe nding on \nwhat my intuition tells me. For me this next action  would go \neither on my \"At Computer\" list or on \"Anywhere\" (b ecause I can \ndraw mind-maps wherever I am, as long as I have pen  and paper). \nOrganizing You may have some projects for which you have \nalready collected notes and miscellaneous support m aterials, and \nyou just need to sort through them and get them int o a more struc- \ntured form. In this case, your next action would li kely be \"Organize \nProject X notes.\" If you have to be in your office to do that \n(because that's where the files are, and you don't want to carry \nthem around), that action should go on your \"At Off ice\" action list. \nIf you're carrying the project notes around with yo u in a folder, or \nin a portable organizer or on a laptop, then the \"O rganize ...\" \naction would go on an \"Anywhere\" or \"Misc.\" action list if you're \ngoing to do it by hand, or on \"At Computer\" if you' re going to use a \nword processor, outliner, or project-planning softw are. \nOne of the greatest \nblocks to organi- \nzational productivity \nis the lack of \ndecision by a senior \nperson about the \nnecessity of a meet- \ning, and with whom, \nto move an im- \nportant issue \nforward. Setting Up Meetings Often, progress will be made \non project thinking when you set up a meeting with \nthe people you'd like to have involved in the brain - \nstorming. That usually means sending an e-mail to \nthe whole group or to an assistant to get it calen-\ndared, or making a phone call to the first person t o \nnail down a time. \nGathering Information Sometimes the next task on \nproject thinking is to gather more data. Maybe you \nneed to talk to someone to get his or her input (\"C all \nBill re his thoughts on the managers' meeting\"). Or\n214 \nCHAPTER 10  |  GETTING PROJECTS UNDER CONTROL \nyou need to look through the files you just inherit ed from last \nyear's conference (\"Review Associate Conference arc hive files\"). \nOr you want to surf the Web to get a sense of what' s happening \n\"out there\" on a new topic you're exploring (\"R&D s earch firms \nfor sales executives\"). \nRandom Project Thinking \nDon't lose any ideas about projects that could pote ntially be use- \nful. Many times you'll think of something you don't  want to forget \nwhen you're a place that has nothing to do with the  project. You're \ndriving to the store, for example, and you think of  a great way that \nyou might want to start off the next staff meeting.  Or you're stir-",

Then they can reside there for later use as needed. \nProjects That Need Next Actions About Planning \nThere are probably a few projects you can think of right now, off \nthe top of your head, that you know you want to get  more objecti- \nfied, fleshed out, and under control. Perhaps you h ave an impor- \ntant meeting coming up and you know you have to pre pare an \nagenda and materials for it. Or you've just inherit ed the job of \ncoordinating the annual associates' conference, and  you've got to \nget it organized as soon as possible so you can sta rt delegating sig- \nnificant pieces. Or you've got to clarify a job des cription for a new \nposition on your team to give to Human Resources. I f you haven't \ndone it already, get a next action now that will start the planning \nprocess for each of these, and put it on the approp riate action list. \nThen proceed with further planning steps. \nTypical Planning Steps \nThe most common types of planning-oriented actions will be \nyour own brainstorming and organizing, setting up m eetings, and \ngathering information. \nBrainstorming Some of the projects that have your attention \nright now will require you to do your own free-form  thinking; this \nis especially true of those for which you were not clear about what \n213 \nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY | PART TWO \nthe next action would be when you made that decisio n. These \nshould all have a next action, such as \"Draft ideas  re X.\" \nYou need to decide where and how you want to do tha t \naction, in order to know which action list to put i t on. Do you do \nthis kind of thinking best on a computer, or by han d-writing your \nthoughts on paper? I may choose either medium, depe nding on \nwhat my intuition tells me. For me this next action  would go \neither on my \"At Computer\" list or on \"Anywhere\" (b ecause I can \ndraw mind-maps wherever I am, as long as I have pen  and paper). \nOrganizing You may have some projects for which you have \nalready collected notes and miscellaneous support m aterials, and \nyou just need to sort through them and get them int o a more struc- \ntured form.

    "text": " place that has nothing to do with the  project. You're \ndriving to the store, for example, and you think of  a great way that \nyou might want to start off the next staff meeting.  Or you're stir- \nring the spaghetti sauce in the kitchen and it occu rs to you that \nyou might want to give out nice tote bags to partic ipants in the \nupcoming conference. Or you're watching the evening  news when \nyou suddenly remember another key person you might want to \ninclude in the advisory council you're putting toge ther. \nIf these aren't specifically next actions that can go directly on \nyour action lists, you'll still need to capture and  organize them \nsomewhere that makes sense. Of course the most crit ical tools for \nensuring that nothing gets lost is your collection system—your \nin-basket, pad, and paper (or equivalents) at work and at home, \nand in a portable version (an index card) while you 're out and \nabout. You need to hold all your ideas until you la ter decide what \nto do with them. \nTools and Structures That Support \nProject Thinking \nNo matter at what level project ideas show up, it's  great to have \ngood tools always close at hand for capturing them as they occur. \nOnce they've been captured, it's useful to have acc ess to them \nwhenever you need to refer to them. \n215 \nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY I  PART TWO \nThinking Tools \nOne of the great secrets to getting ideas and incre asing your pro- \nductivity is utilizing the function-follows-form ph enomenon—\ngreat tools can trigger good thinking. (I've come u p \nwith some of my most productive thoughts when \nplaying with my Palm organizer in an airport, wait-\ning for a flight!) \nIf you aren't writing anything down, it's \nextremely difficult to stay focused on anything for\nmore than a few minutes, especially if you're by yo ur- \nself. But when you utilize physical tools to keep y our \nthinking anchored, you can stay engaged construc- \ntively for hours. \nWriting Instruments \nKeep good writing tools around all the time so you never have any \nunconscious resistance to thinking due to not havin g \nanything to capture it with. If I don't have some- \nthing to write with, I can sense that I'm not as co m- \nfortable letting myself think about projects and \nsituations. \nConversely, I have done some great thinking \nand planning at times just because I wanted to use \nmy nice-looking, smooth-writing ballpoint pen! You \nmay not be inspired by cool gear like I am, but if you \nare, do yourself a favor and invest in quality writ ing \ntools. \nI also suggest that you keep nice ballpoint pens at  the sta- \ntions where you're likely to want to take notes—par ticularly near \nthe phones around your house. \n216 Luck affects \neverything. Let \nyour hook always \nbe cast; in the \nstream where you \nleast expect it there \nwill be a fish. \n—\nFunction often \nfollows form. Give \nyourself a context \nfor capturing \nthoughts, and \nthoughts will occur \nthat you don't yet \nknow you have. \nCHAPTER 10  |  GETTING PROJECTS UNDER CONTROL \nPaper and Pads \nIn addition to writing tools, you should always hav e functional \npads of paper close at hand. Legal pads work well b ecause you can \neasily tear off pages with ideas and notes and toss\nthem into your in-basket until you get a chance to \nprocess them. Also you will often want to keep some\nof your informal mind-maps, and you can put those \nseparate pieces of paper in appropriate file folder s \nwithout having to rewrite them. \nEasels and Whiteboards \nIf you have room for them, whiteboards and/or easel  pads are very \nfunctional thinking tools to use from time to time.  They give you \nplenty of space on which to jot down ideas, and it can be useful to \nkeep them up in front of you for while, as you incu - \nbate on a topic. Whiteboards are great to have on a\nwall in your office and in meeting rooms, and the \nbigger the better. If you have children, I recommen d \nthat you install one in their bedrooms (I wish I'd \ngrown up with the encouragement to have as many \nideas as I could!). Be sure to keep plenty of fresh  markers on hand; \nit's frustrating to want to start writing on a whit eboard and find \nthat all the markers are dry and useless. \nWhenever two or more people are gathered for a meet ing, \nsomeone should start",

    "text": " good writing tools around all the time so you never have any \nunconscious resistance to thinking due to not havin g \nanything to capture it with. If I don't have some- \nthing to write with, I can sense that I'm not as co m- \nfortable letting myself think about projects and \nsituations. \nConversely, I have done some great thinking \nand planning at times just because I wanted to use \nmy nice-looking, smooth-writing ballpoint pen! You \nmay not be inspired by cool gear like I am, but if you \nare, do yourself a favor and invest in quality writ ing \ntools. \nI also suggest that you keep nice ballpoint pens at  the sta- \ntions where you're likely to want to take notes—par ticularly near \nthe phones around your house. \n216 Luck affects \neverything. Let \nyour hook always \nbe cast; in the \nstream where you \nleast expect it there \nwill be a fish. \n—\nFunction often \nfollows form. Give \nyourself a context \nfor capturing \nthoughts, and \nthoughts will occur \nthat you don't yet \nknow you have. \nCHAPTER 10  |  GETTING PROJECTS UNDER CONTROL \nPaper and Pads \nIn addition to writing tools, you should always hav e functional \npads of paper close at hand. Legal pads work well b ecause you can \neasily tear off pages with ideas and notes and toss\nthem into your in-basket until you get a chance to \nprocess them. Also you will often want to keep some\nof your informal mind-maps, and you can put those \nseparate pieces of paper in appropriate file folder s \nwithout having to rewrite them. \nEasels and Whiteboards \nIf you have room for them, whiteboards and/or easel  pads are very \nfunctional thinking tools to use from time to time.  They give you \nplenty of space on which to jot down ideas, and it can be useful to \nkeep them up in front of you for while, as you incu - \nbate on a topic. Whiteboards are great to have on a\nwall in your office and in meeting rooms, and the \nbigger the better. If you have children, I recommen d \nthat you install one in their bedrooms (I wish I'd \ngrown up with the encouragement to have as many \nideas as I could!). Be sure to keep plenty",

    "text": " good writing tools around all the time so you never have any \nunconscious resistance to thinking due to not havin g \nanything to capture it with. If I don't have some- \nthing to write with, I can sense that I'm not as co m- \nfortable letting myself think about projects and \nsituations. \nConversely, I have done some great thinking \nand planning at times just because I wanted to use \nmy nice-looking, smooth-writing ballpoint pen! You \nmay not be inspired by cool gear like I am, but if you \nare, do yourself a favor and invest in quality writ ing \ntools. \nI also suggest that you keep nice ballpoint pens at  the sta- \ntions where you're likely to want to take notes—par ticularly near \nthe phones around your house. \n216 Luck affects \neverything. Let \nyour hook always \nbe cast; in the \nstream where you \nleast expect it there \nwill be a fish. \n—\nFunction often \nfollows form. Give \nyourself a context \nfor capturing \nthoughts, and \nthoughts will occur \nthat you don't yet \nknow you have. \nCHAPTER 10  |  GETTING",

Legal pads work well b ecause you can \neasily tear off pages with ideas and notes and toss\nthem into your in-basket until you get a chance to \nprocess them. Also you will often want to keep some\nof your informal mind-maps, and you can put those \nseparate pieces of paper in appropriate file folder s \nwithout having to rewrite them. \nEasels and Whiteboards \nIf you have room for them, whiteboards and/or easel  pads are very \nfunctional thinking tools to use from time to time.  They give you \nplenty of space on which to jot down ideas, and it can be useful to \nkeep them up in front of you for while, as you incu - \nbate on a topic.

    "text": " of fresh  markers on hand; \nit's frustrating to want to start writing on a whit eboard and find \nthat all the markers are dry and useless. \nWhenever two or more people are gathered for a meet ing, \nsomeone should start writing somewhere where the ot her(s) can \nsee. Even if you erase your thoughts after a few mi nutes, just the \nact of writing them down facilitates a constructive  thinking \nprocess like nothing else. (I've found it immensely  helpful at times \nto draw informal diagrams and notes on paper tablec loths, place \nmats, or even napkins in restaurants, if I didn't h ave my own pad \nof paper at hand.) \n217 Where is your \nclosest pad? Keep it\ncloser.\nHow do I know \nwhat I think, until \nI hear what I say? \n—E. M. Forster \nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY I  PART TWO \nThe Computer \nMany times I like to think on my laptop, in my word  processor. \nThere are so many things I might want to do later o n with my \nthinking, and it feels terrific to already have it in some digital \nform for later editing and cutting and pasting into\nvarious other applications. Once I've booted up and\nthe screen is ready in front of me, I find that thi nking \njust automatically starts to happen. This is anothe r \ngood reason to ensure that your typing and keyboard\nskills are sufficient to make engaging with the com puter at least \neasy, if not downright fun. \nThe Support Structures \nIn addition to good tools ubiquitously at hand, it is productive to \nhave accessible formats into which project thinking  can be cap- \ntured. Much as a pen and paper in front of you supp orts brain- \nstorming, having good tools and places for organizi ng project \ndetails facilitates the more linear planning that m any projects \nneed. \nCreate File Folders or Loose-Leaf Pages as Needed \nA good general-reference filing system, right at ha nd and easy to \nuse, is not only critical to manage the general wor kflow process, \nbut highly functional for project thinking as well.  Often a project \nbegins to emerge when it's triggered by relevant da ta, notes, and \nmiscellaneous materials, and for this reason, you'l l want to create \na folder for a topic as soon as you have something to put in it. If \nyour filing system is too formal (or nonexistent), you'll probably \nmiss many opportunities to generate a project focus  sufficiently \nearly. As soon as you return from that first meetin g with your ini- \ntial notes about a topic that has just emerged on t he horizon, cre- \nate a file and store them in it right away (after y ou have gleaned \nany next actions, of course). \nMany times, in coaching clients, I find that the me re act of \n218 Leverage your \ncomputer as a think \nstation. \nCHAPTER 10  |  GETTING PROJECTS UNDER CONTROL \ncreating a file for a topic into which we can organ ize random \nnotes and potentially relevant materials gives them  a significantly \nimproved sense of control. It's a way of physically , visibly, and psy- \nchologically getting their \"arms around it.\" \nIf you like to work with a loose-leaf notebook or \nplanner, it's good to keep an inventory of fresh no te \npaper or graph paper that you can use to set up a p age \non a theme or project as it shows up. While some \nprojects may later deserve a whole tabbed section o r \neven an entire notebook of their own, they don't st art \nout that way. And most of your projects may need \nonly a page or two to hold the few ideas you need t o \ntrack. \nSoftware Tools \nSoftware is in one sense a dark black hole to explo re in search of \ngood \"project management\" tools. For the most part,  the applica- \ntions that are specifically designed for project or ganizing are way \ntoo complex, with too much horsepower to really be functional for \n98 percent of what most people need to manage. They 're appro- \npriate only for the very small percentage of the pr ofessional world \nthat actually needs them. The rest of us usually fi nd bits and \npieces of applications more informal and project-fr iendly. As I've \nnoted, I have never seen any two projects that need ed the same \namount of detailing and structure to get them under  control. So it \nwould be difficult to create any one application th at would suffice \nfor the majority. \nDigital Outlining Most of what anyone needs to structure his \nor her thinking about projects can be found in any kind of ap- \nplication that",

    "text": " of fresh  markers on hand; \nit's frustrating to want to start writing on a whit eboard and find \nthat all the markers are dry and useless. \nWhenever two or more people are gathered for a meet ing, \nsomeone should start writing somewhere where the ot her(s) can \nsee. Even if you erase your thoughts after a few mi nutes, just the \nact of writing them down facilitates a constructive  thinking \nprocess like nothing else. (I've found it immensely  helpful at times \nto draw informal diagrams and notes on paper tablec loths, place \nmats, or even napkins in restaurants, if I didn't h ave my own pad \nof paper at hand.) \n217 Where is your \nclosest pad? Keep it\ncloser.\nHow do I know \nwhat I think, until \nI hear what I say? \n—E. M. Forster \nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY I  PART TWO \nThe Computer \nMany times I like to think on my laptop, in my word  processor. \nThere are so many things I might want to do later o n with my \nthinking, and it feels terrific to already have it in some digital \nform for later editing and cutting and pasting into\nvarious other applications. Once I've booted up and\nthe screen is ready in front of me, I find that thi nking \njust automatically starts to happen. This is anothe r \ngood reason to ensure that your typing and keyboard\nskills are sufficient to make engaging with the com puter at least \neasy, if not downright fun. \nThe Support Structures \nIn addition to good tools ubiquitously at hand, it is productive to \nhave accessible formats into which project thinking  can be cap- \ntured. Much as a pen and paper in front of you supp orts brain- \nstorming, having good tools and places for organizi ng project \ndetails facilitates the more linear planning that m any projects \nneed. \nCreate File Folders or Loose-Leaf Pages as Needed \nA good general-reference filing system, right at ha nd and easy to \nuse, is not only critical to manage the general wor kflow process, \nbut highly functional for project thinking as well.  Often a project \nbegins to emerge when it's triggered by relevant da ta, notes, and \nmiscellaneous materials, and for this reason, you'l l want to create \na folder for a topic as soon",

    "text": " project thinking as well.  Often a project \nbegins to emerge when it's triggered by relevant da ta, notes, and \nmiscellaneous materials, and for this reason, you'l l want to create \na folder for a topic as soon as you have something to put in it. If \nyour filing system is too formal (or nonexistent), you'll probably \nmiss many opportunities to generate a project focus  sufficiently \nearly. As soon as you return from that first meetin g with your ini- \ntial notes about a topic that has just emerged on t he horizon, cre- \nate a file and store them in it right away (after y ou have gleaned \nany next actions, of course). \nMany times, in coaching clients, I find that the me re act of \n218 Leverage your \ncomputer as a think \nstation. \nCHAPTER 10  |  GETTING PROJECTS UNDER CONTROL \ncreating a file for a topic into which we can organ ize random \nnotes and potentially relevant materials gives them  a significantly \nimproved sense of control. It's a way of physically , visibly, and psy- \nchologically getting their \"arms around it.\" \nIf you like to work with a loose-leaf notebook or \nplanner, it's good to keep an inventory of fresh no te \npaper or graph paper that you can use to set up a p age \non a theme or project as it shows up. While some \nprojects may later deserve a whole tabbed section o r \neven an entire notebook of their own, they don't st art \nout that way. And most of your projects may need \nonly a page or two to hold the few ideas you need t o \ntrack. \nSoftware Tools \nSoftware is in one sense a dark black hole to explo re in search of \ngood \"project management\" tools. For the most part,  the applica- \ntions that are specifically designed for project or ganizing are way \ntoo complex, with too much horsepower to really be functional for \n98 percent of what most people need to manage. They 're appro- \npriate only for the very small percentage of the pr ofessional world \nthat actually needs them. The rest of us usually fi nd bits and \npieces of applications more informal and project-fr iendly. As I've \nnoted, I have never seen any two projects that need ed the same \namount of detailing and structure to get them under  control. So",

Often a project \nbegins to emerge when it's triggered by relevant da ta, notes, and \nmiscellaneous materials, and for this reason, you'l l want to create \na folder for a topic as soon as you have something to put in it. If \nyour filing system is too formal (or nonexistent), you'll probably \nmiss many opportunities to generate a project focus  sufficiently \nearly. As soon as you return from that first meetin g with your ini- \ntial notes about a topic that has just emerged on t he horizon, cre- \nate a file and store them in it right away (after y ou have gleaned \nany next actions, of course). \nMany times, in coaching clients, I find that the me re act of \n218 Leverage your \ncomputer as a think \nstation. \nCHAPTER 10  |  GETTING PROJECTS UNDER CONTROL \ncreating a file for a topic into which we can organ ize random \nnotes and potentially relevant materials gives them  a significantly \nimproved sense of control.

    "text": " it \nwould be difficult to create any one application th at would suffice \nfor the majority. \nDigital Outlining Most of what anyone needs to structure his \nor her thinking about projects can be found in any kind of ap- \nplication that has a simple hierarchical outlining function. I \nused to use a Symantec program called Grandview, an d now I \noften use Microsoft Word for just this kind of proj ect planning. \nHere's a piece of an outline I created for one of o ur own planning \nsessions: \n219 If you don't have a \ngood system for \nfiling bad ideas, you \nprobably don't have \none for filing good \nones, either.\n220 \nThe great thing about outlining applications is tha t they can \nbe as complex or as simple as required. There are n umerous soft- \nware programs that provide this kind of basic hiera rchical struc- \nturing. The trick is to find one that you feel comf ortable with, so \nyou can rapidly get familiar with how to insert hea dings and sub- \nheadings and move them around as needed. Until you can stop \nfocusing on how to use the program, you'll resist b ooting it up and \nusing it to think and organize. \nIt doesn't really matter where you put this kind of  thinking, \nso long as it's easily accessible so you can input and review it as \nneeded. \nBrainstorming Applications Several applications have been \ndeveloped specifically to facilitate the brainstorm ing process. \n\"Inspiration\" was one, based on the mind-mapping te chniques of PRACTICIN \nCHAPTER 10  I  GETTING PROJECTS UNDER CONTROL \nTony Buzan. It had some useful features, but me, I' ve gone back \nto paper and cool pen for the kind of rapid, inform al thinking I \nusually need to do. \nThe problem with digitizing brainstorming is that f or the \nmost part we don't need to save what we brainstorm in the way we \nbrainstormed it—the critical thing is the conclusio ns we \ndevelop \nfrom that raw thinking. The slick brainstorming-cap ture tools, \nlike electronic whiteboards and digital handwriting -copying gear, \nultimately will probably not be as successful as th e manufacturers \nhoped. We don't need to save creative thinking so m uch as we do \nthe structures we generate from it. There are signi ficant differ- \nences among collecting and processing and organizin g, and dif- \nferent tools are usually required for them. You mig ht as well dump \nideas into a word processor. \nProject-Planning Applications As I've mentioned, most project- \nplanning software is too rigorous for the majority of the project \nthinking and planning we need to do. Over the years  I've seen \nthese programs more often tried and discontinued th an utilized as \na consistent tool. When they're used successfully, they're usually \nhighly customized to fit very specific requirements  for the com- \npany or the industry. \nI anticipate that less structured and more function al appli- \ncations will emerge in the coming years, based on t he ways we \nnaturally think and plan. Until then, best stick wi th some good \nand simple outliner. \nAttaching Digital Notes \nIf you are using a digital organizer, much of the p roject planning \nyou need to capture outside your head can in fact b e satisfactorily \nmanaged in an attached note field. If you have the project itself as \nan item on a list on a Palm, or as a task in Micros oft Outlook, you \ncan open the accompanying \"Note\" section and jot id eas, bullet \npoints, and subcomponents of the project. Just ensu re that you \nreview the attachment appropriately to make it usef ul. \n221 \nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  |  PART TWO \nHow Do I Apply All This in My World? \nJust as your \"Next Actions\" lists need to be up-to- date, so, \ntoo, does your \"Projects\" list. That done, give you rself a block of \ntime, ideally between one and three hours, to handl e \nas much of the \"vertical\" thinking about each proje ct \nas you can. \nAt the very least, right now or as soon as possi- \nble, take those few of your projects that you have the \nmost attention on or interest in right now and do \nsome thinking and collecting and organizing on \nthem, using whatever tools seem most appropriate. \nFocus on each one, one at a time, top to bottom. \nAs you do, ask yourself, \"What about this do I want  to know, cap- \nture, or remember?\" \nYou may just want to mind-map some thoughts",

I \nused to use a Symantec program called Grandview, an d now I \noften use Microsoft Word for just this kind of proj ect planning. \nHere's a piece of an outline I created for one of o ur own planning \nsessions: \n219 If you don't have a \ngood system for \nfiling bad ideas, you \nprobably don't have \none for filing good \nones, either.\n220 \nThe great thing about outlining applications is tha t they can \nbe as complex or as simple as required. There are n umerous soft- \nware programs that provide this kind of basic hiera rchical struc- \nturing. The trick is to find one that you feel comf ortable with, so \nyou can rapidly get familiar with how to insert hea dings and sub- \nheadings and move them around as needed. Until you can stop \nfocusing on how to use the program, you'll resist b ooting it up and \nusing it to think and organize. \nIt doesn't really matter where you put this kind of  thinking, \nso long as it's easily accessible so you can input and review it as \nneeded. \nBrainstorming Applications Several applications have been \ndeveloped specifically to facilitate the brainstorm ing process. \n\"Inspiration\" was one, based on the mind-mapping te chniques of PRACTICIN \nCHAPTER 10  I  GETTING PROJECTS UNDER CONTROL \nTony Buzan. It had some useful features, but me, I' ve gone back \nto paper and cool pen for the kind of rapid, inform al thinking I \nusually need to do. \nThe problem with digitizing brainstorming is that f or the \nmost part we don't need to save what we brainstorm in the way we \nbrainstormed it—the critical thing is the conclusio ns we \ndevelop \nfrom that raw thinking. The slick brainstorming-cap ture tools, \nlike electronic whiteboards and digital handwriting -copying gear, \nultimately will probably not be as successful as th e manufacturers \nhoped. We don't need to save creative thinking so m uch as we do \nthe structures we generate from",

We don't need to save creative thinking so m uch as we do \nthe structures we generate from it. There are signi ficant differ- \nences among collecting and processing and organizin g, and dif- \nferent tools are usually required for them. You mig ht as well dump \nideas into a word processor. \nProject-Planning Applications As I've mentioned, most project- \nplanning software is too rigorous for the majority of the project \nthinking and planning we need to do. Over the years  I've seen \nthese programs more often tried and discontinued th an utilized as \na consistent tool. When they're used successfully, they're usually \nhighly customized to fit very specific requirements  for the com- \npany or the industry. \nI anticipate that less structured and more function al appli- \ncations will emerge in the coming years, based on t he ways we \nnaturally think and plan. Until then, best stick wi th some good \nand simple outliner. \nAttaching Digital Notes \nIf you are using a digital organizer, much of the p roject planning \nyou need to capture outside your head can in fact b e satisfactorily \nmanaged in an attached note field. If you have the project itself as \nan item on a list on a Palm, or as a task in Micros oft Outlook, you \ncan open the accompanying \"Note\" section and jot id eas, bullet \npoints, and subcomponents of the project. Just ensu re that you \nreview the attachment appropriately to make it usef ul. \n221 \nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  |  PART TWO \nHow Do I Apply All This in My World? \nJust as your \"Next Actions\" lists need to be up-to- date, so, \ntoo, does your \"Projects\" list. That done, give you rself a block of \ntime, ideally between one and three hours, to handl e \nas much of the \"vertical\" thinking about each proje ct \nas you can. \nAt the very least, right now or as soon as possi- \nble, take those few of your projects that you have the \nmost attention on or interest in right now and do \nsome thinking and collecting and organizing on \nthem, using whatever tools seem most appropriate. \nFocus",

You  may come up \nwith some simple bullet-point headings to attach as  a \n\"note\" in your software organizer. Or you could cre - \nate a Word file and start an outline on it. \nThe key is to get comfortable with having and \nusing your ideas. And to acquire the habit of focus ing \nyour energy constructively, on intended outcomes \nand open loops, before you have to. \n222 Clear the deck, \ncreate a context, \nand do some \ncreative project \nthinking. You'll then \nbe way ahead of \nmost people. \nLet our advance \nworrying become \nadvance thinking \nand planning. \n—\nWinston",

You  may come up \nwith some simple bullet-point headings to attach as  a \n\"note\" in your software organizer. Or you could cre - \nate a Word file and start an outline on it. \nThe key is to get comfortable with having and \nusing your ideas. And to acquire the habit of focus ing \nyour energy constructively, on intended outcomes \nand open loops, before you have to. \n222 Clear the deck, \ncreate a context, \nand do some \ncreative project \nthinking. You'll then \nbe way ahead of \nmost people. \nLet our advance \nworrying become \nadvance thinking \nand planning. \n—\nWinston",

You  may come up \nwith some simple bullet-point headings to attach as  a \n\"note\" in your software organizer. Or you could cre - \nate a Word file and start an outline on it. \nThe key is to get comfortable with having and \nusing your ideas. And to acquire the habit of focus ing \nyour energy constructively, on intended outcomes \nand open loops, before you have to. \n222 Clear the deck, \ncreate a context, \nand do some \ncreative project \nthinking. You'll then \nbe way ahead of \nmost people. \nLet our advance \nworrying become \nadvance thinking \nand planning. \n—\nWinston",
