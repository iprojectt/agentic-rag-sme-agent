She believed\nshe could improve the eating habits of thousands of\nhospital staﬀ and visitors without changing their willpower\nor motivation in the slightest way . In fact, she didn’t plan\non talking to them at all.\nThorndike and her colleagues designed a six -month study\nto alter the “choice architecture” of the hospital cafeteria.\nThey started by changing how drinks were arranged in the\nroom. Originally , the refrigerators located next to the cash\nregisters in the cafeteria were ﬁlled with only soda. The\nresearchers added water as an option to each one.\nAdditionally , they placed baskets of bottled water next to\nthe food stations throughout the room. Soda was still in the\nprimary refrigerators, but water was now available at all\ndrink locations.\nOver the next three months, the number of soda sales at\nthe hospital dropped by 11.4 percent. Meanwhile, sales of\nbottled water increased by 25.8 percent. They made similar\nadjustments—and saw similar results—with the food in the\ncafeteria. Nobody had said a word to anyone eating there.\nAFTER BEFORE\nFIGURE 8:  Here is a r epresentation of what the cafeteria look ed\nlike befor e the envir onment design changes wer e made (lef t)\nand af ter (right). The shaded bo xes indicate ar eas wher e bottled\nwater was available in each instance. Because the amount of\nwater in the envir onment was incr eased, behavior shif ted\nnaturally and without additional motivation.\nPeople often choose products not because of what  they\nare, but because of where  they are. If I walk into the\nkitchen and see a plate of cookies on the counter , I’ll pick\nup half a dozen and start eating, even if I hadn’t been\nthinking about them beforehand and didn’t necessarily feel\nhungry . If the communal table at the oﬀice is always ﬁlled\nwith doughnuts and bagels, it’s going to be hard not to\ngrab one every now and then. Y our habits change\ndepending on the room you are in and the cues in front of\nyou.\nEnvironment is the invisible hand that shapes human\nbehavior . Despite our unique personalities, certain\nbehaviors tend to arise again and again under certain\nenvironmental conditions. In church, people tend to talk in\nwhispers. On a dark street, people act wary and guarded.\nIn this way , the most common form of change is not\ninternal, but external: we are changed by the world around\nus. Every habit is context dependent.\nIn 1936, psychologist K urt Lewin wrote a simple\nequation that makes a powerful statement: Behavior is a\nfunction of the P erson in their Environment, or B = f (P,E).\nIt didn’t take long for Lewin’s Equation to be tested in\nbusiness. In 1952, the economist Hawkins Stern described\na phenomenon he called Suggestion Impulse Buying , which\n“is triggered when a shopper sees a product for the ﬁrst\ntime and visualizes a need for it.” In other words,\ncustomers will occasionally buy products not because they\nwant  them but because of how they are presented  to them.\nFor example, items at eye level tend to be purchased\nmore than those down near the ﬂoor . For this reason, you’ll\nﬁnd expensive brand names featured in easy-to-reach\nlocations on store shelves because they drive the most\nproﬁt, while cheaper alternatives are tucked away in\nharder-to-reach spots. The same goes for end caps, which\nare the units at the end of aisles. End caps are\nmoneymaking machines for retailers because they are\nobvious locations that encounter a lot of foot traﬀic. F or\nexample, 45 percent of Coca-Cola sales come speciﬁcally\nfrom end-of -the-aisle racks.\nThe more obviously available a product or service is, the\nmore likely you are to try it. People drink Bud Light\nbecause it is in every bar and visit Starbucks because it is\non every corner . We like to think that we are in control. If\nwe choose water over soda, we assume it is because we\nwanted to do so . The truth, however , is that many of the\nactions we take each day are shaped not by purposeful\ndrive and choice but by the most obvious option.\nEvery living being has its own methods for sensing and\nunderstanding the world. Eagles have remarkable long-\ndistance vision. Snakes can smell by “tasting the air” with\ntheir highly sensitive",

    "text": "6\nMotivation Is Over rated; Envir onment Of ten Matters\nMore\nANNE THORNDIKE , A primary care physician at Massachusetts\nGeneral Hospital in Boston, had a crazy idea. She believed\nshe could improve the eating habits of thousands of\nhospital staﬀ and visitors without changing their willpower\nor motivation in the slightest way . In fact, she didn’t plan\non talking to them at all.\nThorndike and her colleagues designed a six -month study\nto alter the “choice architecture” of the hospital cafeteria.\nThey started by changing how drinks were arranged in the\nroom. Originally , the refrigerators located next to the cash\nregisters in the cafeteria were ﬁlled with only soda. The\nresearchers added water as an option to each one.\nAdditionally , they placed baskets of bottled water next to\nthe food stations throughout the room. Soda was still in the\nprimary refrigerators, but water was now available at all\ndrink locations.\nOver the next three months, the number of soda sales at\nthe hospital dropped by 11.4 percent. Meanwhile, sales of\nbottled water increased by 25.8 percent. They made similar\nadjustments—and saw similar results—with the food in the\ncafeteria. Nobody had said a word to anyone eating there.\nAFTER BEFORE\nFIGURE 8:  Here is a r epresentation of what the cafeteria look ed\nlike befor e the envir onment design changes wer e made (lef t)\nand af ter (right). The shaded bo xes indicate ar eas wher e bottled\nwater was available in each instance. Because the amount of\nwater in the envir onment was incr eased, behavior shif ted\nnaturally and without additional motivation.\nPeople often choose products not because of what  they\nare, but because of where  they are. If I walk into the\nkitchen and see a plate of cookies on the counter , I’ll pick\nup half a dozen and start eating, even if I hadn’t been\nthinking about them beforehand and didn’t necessarily feel\nhungry . If the communal table at the oﬀice is always ﬁlled\nwith doughnuts and bagels, it’s going to be hard not to\ngrab one every now and then. Y our habits change\ndepending on the room you are in and the cues in front of\nyou.\nEnvironment is the invisible hand that shapes human\nbehavior .",

    "text": "els, it’s going to be hard not to\ngrab one every now and then. Y our habits change\ndepending on the room you are in and the cues in front of\nyou.\nEnvironment is the invisible hand that shapes human\nbehavior . Despite our unique personalities, certain\nbehaviors tend to arise again and again under certain\nenvironmental conditions. In church, people tend to talk in\nwhispers. On a dark street, people act wary and guarded.\nIn this way , the most common form of change is not\ninternal, but external: we are changed by the world around\nus. Every habit is context dependent.\nIn 1936, psychologist K urt Lewin wrote a simple\nequation that makes a powerful statement: Behavior is a\nfunction of the P erson in their Environment, or B = f (P,E).\nIt didn’t take long for Lewin’s Equation to be tested in\nbusiness. In 1952, the economist Hawkins Stern described\na phenomenon he called Suggestion Impulse Buying , which\n“is triggered when a shopper sees a product for the ﬁrst\ntime and visualizes a need for it.” In other words,\ncustomers will occasionally buy products not because they\nwant  them but because of how they are presented  to them.\nFor example, items at eye level tend to be purchased\nmore than those down near the ﬂoor . For this reason, you’ll\nﬁnd expensive brand names featured in easy-to-reach\nlocations on store shelves because they drive the most\nproﬁt, while cheaper alternatives are tucked away in\nharder-to-reach spots. The same goes for end caps, which\nare the units at the end of aisles. End caps are\nmoneymaking machines for retailers because they are\nobvious locations that encounter a lot of foot traﬀic. F or\nexample, 45 percent of Coca-Cola sales come speciﬁcally\nfrom end-of -the-aisle racks.\nThe more obviously available a product or service is, the\nmore likely you are to try it. People drink Bud Light\nbecause it is in every bar and visit Starbucks because it is\non every corner . We like to think that we are in control. If\nwe choose water over soda, we assume it is because we\nwanted to do so . The truth, however , is that many of the\nactions we take each day are shaped not by purposeful\n",

    "text": "drive and choice but by the most obvious option.\nEvery living being has its own methods for sensing and\nunderstanding the world. Eagles have remarkable long-\ndistance vision. Snakes can smell by “tasting the air” with\ntheir highly sensitive tongues. Sharks can detect small\namounts of electricity and vibrations in the water caused by\nnearby ﬁsh. Even bacteria have chemoreceptors—tiny\nsensory cells that allow them to detect toxic chemicals in\ntheir environment.\nIn humans, perception is directed by the sensory nervous\nsystem. W e perceive the world through sight, sound, smell,\ntouch, and taste. But we also have other ways of sensing\nstimuli. Some are conscious, but many are nonconscious.\nFor instance, you can “notice” when the temperature drops\nbefore a storm, or when the pain in your gut rises during a\nstomachache, or when you fall oﬀ balance while walking on\nrocky ground. Receptors in your body pick up on a wide\nrange of internal stimuli, such as the amount of salt in your\nblood or the need to drink when thirsty .\nThe most powerful of all human sensory abilities,\nhowever , is vision. The human body has about eleven\nmillion sensory receptors. Approximately ten million of\nthose are dedicated to sight. Some experts estimate that\nhalf of the brain’s resources are used on vision. Given that\nwe are more dependent on vision than on any other sense,\nit should come as no surprise that visual cues are the\ngreatest catalyst of our behavior . For this reason, a small\nchange in what you see can lead to a big shift in what you\ndo. As a result, you can imagine how important it is to live\nand work in environments that are ﬁlled with productive\ncues and devoid of unproductive ones.\nThankfully , there is good news in this respect. Y ou don’t\nhave to be the victim of your environment. Y ou can also be\nthe architect of it.\nHOW TO DESIGN Y OUR ENVIRONMENT FOR SUCCES S\nDuring the energy crisis and oil embargo of the 1970s,\nDutch researchers began to pay close attention to the\ncountry’s energy usage. In one suburb near Amsterdam,\nthey found that some homeowners used 30 percent less\nenergy than their neighbors—despite the homes being of\nsimilar size and getting electricity for the same price.\nIt turned out the houses in this neighborhood were\nnearly identical except for one feature: the location of the\nelectrical meter . Some had one in the basement. Others\nhad the electrical meter upstairs in the main hallway . As\nyou may guess, the homes with the meters located in the\nmain hallway used less electricity . When their energy use\nwas obvious and easy to track, people changed their\nbehavior .\nEvery habit is initiated by a cue, and we are more likely\nto notice cues that stand out. Unfortunately , the\nenvironments where we live and work often make it easy\nnot to do certain actions because there is no obvious cue to\ntrigger the behavior . It’s easy not to practice the guitar\nwhen it’s tucked away in the closet. It’s easy not to read a\nbook when the bookshelf is in the corner of the guest room.\nIt’s easy not to take your vitamins when they are out of\nsight in the pantry . When the cues that spark a habit are\nsubtle or hidden, they are easy to ignore.\nBy comparison, creating obvious visual cues can draw\nyour attention toward a desired habit. In the early 1990s,\nthe cleaning staﬀ at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam\ninstalled a small sticker that looked like a ﬂy near the\ncenter of each urinal. Apparently , when men stepped up to\nthe urinals, they aimed for what they thought was a bug.\nThe stickers improved their aim and signiﬁcantly reduced\n“spillage” around the urinals. Further analysis determined\nthat the stickers cut bathroom cleaning costs by 8 percent\nper year .\nI’ve experienced the power of obvious cues in my own\nlife. I used to buy apples from the store, put them in the\ncrisper in the bottom of the refrigerator , and forget all\nabout them. By the time I remembered, the apples would\nhave gone bad. I never saw them, so I never ate them.\nEventually , I took my own advice and redesigned my\nenvironment. I bought a large display bowl and placed it in\nthe middle of the kitchen counter . The next time I bought\napples, that was where they went—out in the open where I\ncould see them. Almost like magic, I began eating a few\napples each day simply because they were obvious rather\nthan out of sight.\nHere are a few ways you can redesign your environment\nand make the cues for your preferred habits more obvious:\nIf you want to remember to take your",

Snakes can smell by “tasting the air” with\ntheir highly sensitive tongues. Sharks can detect small\namounts of electricity and vibrations in the water caused by\nnearby ﬁsh. Even bacteria have chemoreceptors—tiny\nsensory cells that allow them to detect toxic chemicals in\ntheir environment.\nIn humans, perception is directed by the sensory nervous\nsystem. W e perceive the world through sight, sound, smell,\ntouch, and taste. But we also have other ways of sensing\nstimuli. Some are conscious, but many are nonconscious.\nFor instance, you can “notice” when the temperature drops\nbefore a storm, or when the pain in your gut rises during a\nstomachache, or when you fall oﬀ balance while walking on\nrocky ground. Receptors in your body pick up on a wide\nrange of internal stimuli, such as the amount of salt in your\nblood or the need to drink when thirsty .\nThe most powerful of all human sensory abilities,\nhowever , is vision. The human body has about eleven\nmillion sensory receptors. Approximately ten million of\nthose are dedicated to sight. Some experts estimate that\nhalf of the brain’s resources are used on vision. Given that\nwe are more dependent on vision than on any other sense,\nit should come as no surprise that visual cues are the\ngreatest catalyst of our behavior . For this reason, a small\nchange in what you see can lead to a big shift in what you\ndo. As a result, you can imagine how important it is to live\nand work in environments that are ﬁlled with productive\ncues and devoid of unproductive ones.\nThankfully , there is good news in this respect. Y ou don’t\nhave to be the victim of your environment. Y ou can also be\nthe architect of it.\nHOW TO DESIGN Y OUR ENVIRONMENT FOR SUCCES S\nDuring the energy crisis and oil embargo of the 1970s,\nDutch researchers began to pay close attention to the\ncountry’s energy usage. In one suburb near Amsterdam,\nthey found that some homeowners used 30 percent less\nenergy than their neighbors—despite the homes being of\nsimilar size and getting electricity for the same price.\nIt turned out the houses in this neighborhood were\nnearly",

Even bacteria have chemoreceptors—tiny\nsensory cells that allow them to detect toxic chemicals in\ntheir environment.\nIn humans, perception is directed by the sensory nervous\nsystem.

Some are conscious, but many are nonconscious.\nFor instance, you can “notice” when the temperature drops\nbefore a storm, or when the pain in your gut rises during a\nstomachache, or when you fall oﬀ balance while walking on\nrocky ground. Receptors in your body pick up on a wide\nrange of internal stimuli, such as the amount of salt in your\nblood or the need to drink when thirsty .\nThe most powerful of all human sensory abilities,\nhowever , is vision.

The human body has about eleven\nmillion sensory receptors. Approximately ten million of\nthose are dedicated to sight. Some experts estimate that\nhalf of the brain’s resources are used on vision. Given that\nwe are more dependent on vision than on any other sense,\nit should come as no surprise that visual cues are the\ngreatest catalyst of our behavior . For this reason, a small\nchange in what you see can lead to a big shift in what you\ndo. As a result, you can imagine how important it is to live\nand work in environments that are ﬁlled with productive\ncues and devoid of unproductive ones.\nThankfully , there is good news in this respect. Y ou don’t\nhave to be the victim of your environment. Y ou can also be\nthe architect of it.\nHOW TO DESIGN Y OUR ENVIRONMENT FOR SUCCES S\nDuring the energy crisis and oil embargo of the 1970s,\nDutch researchers began to pay close attention to the\ncountry’s energy usage.

    "text": " one suburb near Amsterdam,\nthey found that some homeowners used 30 percent less\nenergy than their neighbors—despite the homes being of\nsimilar size and getting electricity for the same price.\nIt turned out the houses in this neighborhood were\nnearly identical except for one feature: the location of the\nelectrical meter . Some had one in the basement. Others\nhad the electrical meter upstairs in the main hallway . As\nyou may guess, the homes with the meters located in the\nmain hallway used less electricity . When their energy use\nwas obvious and easy to track, people changed their\nbehavior .\nEvery habit is initiated by a cue, and we are more likely\nto notice cues that stand out. Unfortunately , the\nenvironments where we live and work often make it easy\nnot to do certain actions because there is no obvious cue to\ntrigger the behavior . It’s easy not to practice the guitar\nwhen it’s tucked away in the closet. It’s easy not to read a\nbook when the bookshelf is in the corner of the guest room.\nIt’s easy not to take your vitamins when they are out of\nsight in the pantry . When the cues that spark a habit are\nsubtle or hidden, they are easy to ignore.\nBy comparison, creating obvious visual cues can draw\nyour attention toward a desired habit. In the early 1990s,\nthe cleaning staﬀ at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam\ninstalled a small sticker that looked like a ﬂy near the\ncenter of each urinal. Apparently , when men stepped up to\nthe urinals, they aimed for what they thought was a bug.\nThe stickers improved their aim and signiﬁcantly reduced\n“spillage” around the urinals. Further analysis determined\nthat the stickers cut bathroom cleaning costs by 8 percent\nper year .\nI’ve experienced the power of obvious cues in my own\nlife. I used to buy apples from the store, put them in the\ncrisper in the bottom of the refrigerator , and forget all\nabout them. By the time I remembered, the apples would\nhave gone bad. I never saw them, so I never ate them.\nEventually , I took my own advice and redesigned my\nenvironment. I bought a large display bowl and placed it in\nthe middle of the kitchen counter . The next time I bought\napples, that was where they went—out in the open where I\ncould see them. Almost like magic, I began",

    "text": " one suburb near Amsterdam,\nthey found that some homeowners used 30 percent less\nenergy than their neighbors—despite the homes being of\nsimilar size and getting electricity for the same price.\nIt turned out the houses in this neighborhood were\nnearly identical except for one feature: the location of the\nelectrical meter . Some had one in the basement. Others\nhad the electrical meter upstairs in the main hallway . As\nyou may guess, the homes with the meters located in the\nmain hallway used less electricity . When their energy use\nwas obvious and easy to track, people changed their\nbehavior .\nEvery habit is initiated by a cue, and we are more likely\nto notice cues that stand out. Unfortunately , the\nenvironments where we live and work often make it easy\nnot to do certain actions because there is no obvious cue to\ntrigger the behavior . It’s easy not to practice the guitar\nwhen it’s tucked away in the closet. It’s easy not to read a\nbook when the bookshelf is in the corner of the guest room.\nIt’s easy not to take your vitamins when they are out of\nsight in the pantry . When the cues that spark a habit are\nsubtle or hidden, they are easy to ignore.\n",

When the cues that spark a habit are\nsubtle or hidden, they are easy to ignore.\nBy comparison, creating obvious visual cues can draw\nyour attention toward a desired habit. In the early 1990s,\nthe cleaning staﬀ at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam\ninstalled a small sticker that looked like a ﬂy near the\ncenter of each urinal. Apparently , when men stepped up to\nthe urinals, they aimed for what they thought was a bug.\nThe stickers improved their aim and signiﬁcantly reduced\n“spillage” around the urinals. Further analysis determined\nthat the stickers cut bathroom cleaning costs by 8 percent\nper year .\nI’ve experienced the power of obvious cues in my own\nlife. I used to buy apples from the store, put them in the\ncrisper in the bottom of the refrigerator , and forget all\nabout them. By the time I remembered, the apples would\nhave gone bad. I never saw them, so I never ate them.\nEventually , I took my own advice and redesigned my\nenvironment.",

    "text": " eating a few\napples each day simply because they were obvious rather\nthan out of sight.\nHere are a few ways you can redesign your environment\nand make the cues for your preferred habits more obvious:\nIf you want to remember to take your medication each\nnight, put your pill bottle directly next to the faucet on\nthe bathroom counter .\nIf you want to practice guitar more frequently , place\nyour guitar stand in the middle of the living room.\nIf you want to remember to send more thank -you notes,\nkeep a stack of stationery on your desk.\nIf you want to drink more water , ﬁll up a few water\nbottles each morning and place them in common\nlocations around the house.\nIf you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make\nthe cue a big part of your environment. The most persistent\nbehaviors usually have multiple cues. Consider how many\ndiﬀerent ways a smoker could be prompted to pull out a\ncigarette: driving in the car , seeing a friend smoke, feeling\nstressed at work, and so on.\nThe same strategy can be employed for good habits. By\nsprinkling triggers throughout your surroundings, you\nincrease the odds that you’ll think about your habit\nthroughout the day . Make sure the best choice is the most\nobvious one. Making a better decision is easy and natural\nwhen the cues for good habits are right in front of you.\nEnvironment design is powerful not only because it\ninﬂuences how we engage with the world but also because\nwe rarely do it. Most people live in a world others have\ncreated for them. But you can alter the spaces where you\nlive and work to increase your exposure to positive cues\nand reduce your exposure to negative ones. Environment\ndesign allows you to take back control and become the\narchitect of your life. Be the designer of your world and not\nmerely the consumer of it.\nTHE CONTEXT IS THE CUE\nThe cues that trigger a habit can start out very speciﬁc, but\nover time your habits become associated not with a single\ntrigger but with the entire context  surrounding the\nbehavior .\nFor example, many people drink more in social situations\nthan they would ever drink alone. The trigger is rarely a\nsingle cue, but rather the whole situation: watching your\nfriends order drinks, hearing the music at the bar , seeing\nthe beers on tap.\nWe mentally assign our habits to the locations in which\nthey occur: the home, the oﬀice, the gym. Each location\ndevelops a connection to certain habits and routines. Y ou\nestablish a particular relationship with the objects on your\ndesk, the items on your kitchen counter , the things in your\nbedroom.\nOur behavior is not deﬁned by the objects in the\nenvironment but by our relationship to them. In fact, this is\na useful way to think about the inﬂuence of the\nenvironment on your behavior . Stop thinking about your\nenvironment as ﬁlled with objects. Start thinking about it\nas ﬁlled with relationships. Think in terms of how you\ninteract with the spaces around you. F or one person, her\ncouch is the place where she reads for an hour each night.\nFor someone else, the couch is where he watches television\nand eats a bowl of ice cream after work. Diﬀerent people\ncan have diﬀerent memories—and thus diﬀerent habits—\nassociated with the same place.\nThe good news? Y ou can train yourself to link a\nparticular habit with a particular context.\nIn one study , scientists instructed insomniacs to get into\nbed only when they were tired. If they couldn’t fall asleep,\nthey were told to sit in a diﬀerent room until they became\nsleepy . Over time, subjects began to associate the context\nof their bed with the action of sleeping, and it became\neasier to quickly fall asleep when they climbed in bed.\nTheir brains learned that sleeping—not browsing on their\nphones, not watching television, not staring at the clock—\nwas the only action that happened in that room.\nThe power of context also reveals an important strategy:\nhabits can be easier to change in a new environment. It\nhelps to escape the subtle triggers and cues that nudge you\ntoward your current habits. Go to a new place—a diﬀerent\ncoﬀee shop, a bench in the park, a corner of your room you\nseldom use—and create a new routine there.\nIt is easier to associate a new habit with a new context\nthan to build a new habit in the face of competing cues. It\ncan be diﬀicult to go to bed early if you watch television in\nyour bedroom each night.",

    "text": " eating a few\napples each day simply because they were obvious rather\nthan out of sight.\nHere are a few ways you can redesign your environment\nand make the cues for your preferred habits more obvious:\nIf you want to remember to take your medication each\nnight, put your pill bottle directly next to the faucet on\nthe bathroom counter .\nIf you want to practice guitar more frequently , place\nyour guitar stand in the middle of the living room.\nIf you want to remember to send more thank -you notes,\nkeep a stack of stationery on your desk.\nIf you want to drink more water , ﬁll up a few water\nbottles each morning and place them in common\nlocations around the house.\nIf you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make\nthe cue a big part of your environment. The most persistent\nbehaviors usually have multiple cues. Consider how many\ndiﬀerent ways a smoker could be prompted to pull out a\ncigarette: driving in the car , seeing a friend smoke, feeling\nstressed at work, and so on.\nThe same strategy can be employed for good habits. By\nsprinkling triggers throughout your surroundings, you\nincrease the odds that you’ll think about your habit\nthroughout the day . Make sure the best choice is the most\nobvious one. Making a better decision is easy and natural\nwhen the cues for good habits are right in front of you.\nEnvironment design is powerful not only because it\ninﬂuences how we engage with the world but also because\nwe rarely do it. Most people live in a world others have\ncreated for them. But you can alter the spaces where you\nlive and work to increase your exposure to positive cues\nand reduce your exposure to negative ones. Environment\ndesign allows you to take back control and become the\narchitect of your life. Be the designer of your world and not\nmerely the consumer of it.\nTHE CONTEXT IS THE CUE\nThe cues that trigger a habit can start out very speciﬁc, but\nover time your habits become associated not with a single\ntrigger but with the entire context  surrounding the\nbehavior .\nFor example, many people drink more in social situations\nthan they would ever drink alone. The trigger is rarely a\nsingle cue, but rather the whole situation: watching your\nfriends order drinks, hearing the music at the bar , seeing\nthe beers on tap.\nWe mentally",

    "text": " more in social situations\nthan they would ever drink alone. The trigger is rarely a\nsingle cue, but rather the whole situation: watching your\nfriends order drinks, hearing the music at the bar , seeing\nthe beers on tap.\nWe mentally assign our habits to the locations in which\nthey occur: the home, the oﬀice, the gym. Each location\ndevelops a connection to certain habits and routines. Y ou\nestablish a particular relationship with the objects on your\ndesk, the items on your kitchen counter , the things in your\nbedroom.\nOur behavior is not deﬁned by the objects in the\nenvironment but by our relationship to them. In fact, this is\na useful way to think about the inﬂuence of the\nenvironment on your behavior . Stop thinking about your\nenvironment as ﬁlled with objects. Start thinking about it\nas ﬁlled with relationships. Think in terms of how you\ninteract with the spaces around you. F or one person, her\ncouch is the place where she reads for an hour each night.\nFor someone else, the couch is where he watches television\nand eats a bowl of ice cream after work. Diﬀerent people\ncan have diﬀerent memories—and thus diﬀerent habits—\nassociated with the same place.\nThe good news? Y ou can train yourself to link a\nparticular habit with a particular context.\nIn one study , scientists instructed insomniacs to get into\nbed only when they were tired. If they couldn’t fall asleep,\nthey were told to sit in a diﬀerent room until they became\nsleepy . Over time, subjects began to associate the context\nof their bed with the action of sleeping, and it became\neasier to quickly fall asleep when they climbed in bed.\nTheir brains learned that sleeping—not browsing on their\nphones, not watching television, not staring at the clock—\nwas the only action that happened in that room.\nThe power of context also reveals an important strategy:\nhabits can be easier to change in a new environment. It\nhelps to escape the subtle triggers and cues that nudge you\ntoward your current habits. Go to a new place—a diﬀerent\ncoﬀee shop, a bench in the park, a corner of your room you\nseldom use—and create a new routine there.\nIt",

The trigger is rarely a\nsingle cue, but rather the whole situation: watching your\nfriends order drinks, hearing the music at the bar , seeing\nthe beers on tap.\nWe mentally assign our habits to the locations in which\nthey occur: the home, the oﬀice, the gym. Each location\ndevelops a connection to certain habits and routines. Y ou\nestablish a particular relationship with the objects on your\ndesk, the items on your kitchen counter , the things in your\nbedroom.\nOur behavior is not deﬁned by the objects in the\nenvironment but by our relationship to them. In fact, this is\na useful way to think about the inﬂuence of the\nenvironment on your behavior . Stop thinking about your\nenvironment as ﬁlled with objects. Start thinking about it\nas ﬁlled with relationships. Think in terms of how you\ninteract with the spaces around you.

    "text": " around you. F or one person, her\ncouch is the place where she reads for an hour each night.\nFor someone else, the couch is where he watches television\nand eats a bowl of ice cream after work. Diﬀerent people\ncan have diﬀerent memories—and thus diﬀerent habits—\nassociated with the same place.\nThe good news? Y ou can train yourself to link a\nparticular habit with a particular context.\nIn one study , scientists instructed insomniacs to get into\nbed only when they were tired. If they couldn’t fall asleep,\nthey were told to sit in a diﬀerent room until they became\nsleepy . Over time, subjects began to associate the context\nof their bed with the action of sleeping, and it became\neasier to quickly fall asleep when they climbed in bed.\nTheir brains learned that sleeping—not browsing on their\nphones, not watching television, not staring at the clock—\nwas the only action that happened in that room.\nThe power of context also reveals an important strategy:\nhabits can be easier to change in a new environment. It\nhelps to escape the subtle triggers and cues that nudge you\n",

    "text": " is easier to associate a new habit with a new context\nthan to build a new habit in the face of competing cues. It\ncan be diﬀicult to go to bed early if you watch television in\nyour bedroom each night. It can be hard to study in the\nliving room without getting distracted if that’s where you\nalways play video games. But when you step outside your\nnormal environment, you leave your behavioral biases\nbehind. You aren’t battling old environmental cues, which\nallows new habits to form without interruption.\nWant to think more creatively? Move to a bigger room, a\nrooftop patio, or a building with expansive architecture.\nTake a break from the space where you do your daily work,\nwhich is also linked to your current thought patterns.\nTrying to eat healthier? It is likely that you shop on\nautopilot at your regular supermarket. Try a new grocery\nstore. Y ou may ﬁnd it easier to avoid unhealthy food when\nyour brain doesn’t automatically know where it is located in\nthe store.\nWhen you can’t manage to get to an entirely new\nenvironment, redeﬁne or rearrange your current one.\nCreate a separate space for work, study , exercise,\nentertainment, and cooking. The mantra I ﬁnd useful is\n“One space, one use.”\nWhen I started my career as an entrepreneur , I would\noften work from my couch or at the kitchen table. In the\nevenings, I found it very diﬀicult to stop working. There\nwas no clear division between the end of work time and the\nbeginning of personal time. W as the kitchen table my oﬀice\nor the space where I ate meals? W as the couch where I\nrelaxed or where I sent emails? Everything happened in the\nsame place.\nA few years later , I could ﬁnally aﬀord to move to a home\nwith a separate room for my oﬀice. Suddenly , work was\nsomething that happened “in here” and personal life was\nsomething that happened “out there.” It was easier for me\nto turn oﬀ the professional side of my brain when there was\na clear dividing line between work life and home life. Each\nroom had one primary use. The kitchen was for cooking.\nThe oﬀice was for working.\nWhenever possible, avoid mixing the context of one habit\nwith another . When you start mixing contexts, you’ll start\nmixing habits—and the easier ones will usually win out.\nThis is one reason why the versatility of modern technology\nis both a strength and a weakness. Y ou can use your phone\nfor all sorts of tasks, which makes it a powerful device. But\nwhen you can use your phone to do nearly anything, it\nbecomes hard to associate it with one task. Y ou want to be\nproductive, but you’re also conditioned to browse social\nmedia, check email, and play video games whenever you\nopen your phone. It’s a mishmash of cues.\nYou may be thinking, “ You don’t understand. I live in\nNew Y ork City . My apartment is the size of a smartphone. I\nneed each room to play multiple roles.” F air enough. If your\nspace is limited, divide your room into activity zones: a\nchair for reading, a desk for writing, a table for eating. Y ou\ncan do the same with your digital spaces. I know a writer\nwho uses his computer only for writing, his tablet only for\nreading, and his phone only for social media and texting.\nEvery habit should have a home.\nIf you can manage to stick with this strategy , each\ncontext will become associated with a particular habit and\nmode of thought. Habits thrive under predictable\ncircumstances like these. F ocus comes automatically when\nyou are sitting at your work desk. Relaxation is easier when\nyou are in a space designed for that purpose. Sleep comes\nquickly when it is the only thing that happens in your\nbedroom. If you want behaviors that are stable and\npredictable, you need an environment that is stable and\npredictable.\nA stable environment where everything has a place and a\npurpose is an environment where habits can easily form.\nChapter Summary\nSmall changes in context can lead to large changes in\nbehavior over time.\nEvery habit is initiated by a cue. W e are more likely to\nnotice cues that stand out.\nMake the cues of good habits obvious in your\nenvironment.\nGradually , your habits become associated not with a\nsingle trigger but with the entire context surrounding\nthe behavior . The context becomes the cue.\nIt is easier to build new habits in a new environment\nbecause you are not ﬁghting against old cues.",

It\ncan be diﬀicult to go to bed early if you watch television in\nyour bedroom each night. It can be hard to study in the\nliving room without getting distracted if that’s where you\nalways play video games. But when you step outside your\nnormal environment, you leave your behavioral biases\nbehind. You aren’t battling old environmental cues, which\nallows new habits to form without interruption.\nWant to think more creatively? Move to a bigger room, a\nrooftop patio, or a building with expansive architecture.\nTake a break from the space where you do your daily work,\nwhich is also linked to your current thought patterns.\nTrying to eat healthier? It is likely that you shop on\nautopilot at your regular supermarket. Try a new grocery\nstore. Y ou may ﬁnd it easier to avoid unhealthy food when\nyour brain doesn’t automatically know where it is located in\nthe store.\nWhen you can’t manage to get to an entirely new\nenvironment, redeﬁne or rearrange your current one.\nCreate a separate space for work, study , exercise,\nentertainment, and cooking. The mantra I ﬁnd useful is\n“One space, one use.”\nWhen I started my career as an entrepreneur , I would\noften work from my couch or at the kitchen table. In the\nevenings, I found it very diﬀicult to stop working. There\nwas no clear division between the end of work time and the\nbeginning of personal time. W as the kitchen table my oﬀice\nor the space where I ate meals? W as the couch where I\nrelaxed or where I sent emails? Everything happened in the\nsame place.\nA few years later , I could ﬁnally aﬀord to move to a home\nwith a separate room for my oﬀice. Suddenly , work was\nsomething that happened “in here” and personal life was\nsomething that happened “out there.” It was easier for me\nto turn oﬀ the professional side of my brain when there was\na clear dividing line between work life and home life. Each\nroom had one primary use. The kitchen was for cooking.\nThe oﬀice was for working.\nWhenever possible, avoid mixing the context of one habit\nwith another . When you start",

It\ncan be diﬀicult to go to bed early if you watch television in\nyour bedroom each night. It can be hard to study in the\nliving room without getting distracted if that’s where you\nalways play video games. But when you step outside your\nnormal environment, you leave your behavioral biases\nbehind. You aren’t battling old environmental cues, which\nallows new habits to form without interruption.\nWant to think more creatively? Move to a bigger room, a\nrooftop patio, or a building with expansive architecture.\nTake a break from the space where you do your daily work,\nwhich is also linked to your current thought patterns.\nTrying to eat healthier? It is likely that you shop on\nautopilot at your regular supermarket. Try a new grocery\nstore. Y ou may ﬁnd it easier to avoid unhealthy food when\nyour brain doesn’t automatically know where it is located in\nthe store.\nWhen you can’t manage to get to an entirely new\nenvironment, redeﬁne or rearrange your current one.\nCreate a separate space for work, study , exercise,\nentertainment,",

    "text": " dividing line between work life and home life. Each\nroom had one primary use. The kitchen was for cooking.\nThe oﬀice was for working.\nWhenever possible, avoid mixing the context of one habit\nwith another . When you start mixing contexts, you’ll start\nmixing habits—and the easier ones will usually win out.\nThis is one reason why the versatility of modern technology\nis both a strength and a weakness. Y ou can use your phone\nfor all sorts of tasks, which makes it a powerful device. But\nwhen you can use your phone to do nearly anything, it\nbecomes hard to associate it with one task. Y ou want to be\nproductive, but you’re also conditioned to browse social\nmedia, check email, and play video games whenever you\nopen your phone. It’s a mishmash of cues.\nYou may be thinking, “ You don’t understand. I live in\nNew Y ork City . My apartment is the size of a smartphone. I\nneed each room to play multiple roles.” F air enough. If your\nspace is limited, divide your room into activity zones: a\nchair for reading, a desk for writing, a table for eating. Y ou\ncan do the same with your digital spaces. I know a writer\nwho uses his computer only for writing, his tablet only for\nreading, and his phone only for social media and texting.\nEvery habit should have a home.\nIf you can manage to stick with this strategy , each\ncontext will become associated with a particular habit and\nmode of thought. Habits thrive under predictable\ncircumstances like these. F ocus comes automatically when\nyou are sitting at your work desk. Relaxation is easier when\nyou are in a space designed for that purpose. Sleep comes\nquickly when it is the only thing that happens in your\nbedroom. If you want behaviors that are stable and\npredictable, you need an environment that is stable and\npredictable.\nA stable environment where everything has a place and a\npurpose is an environment where habits can easily form.\nChapter Summary\nSmall changes in context can lead to large changes in\nbehavior over time.\nEvery habit is initiated by a cue. W e are more likely to\nnotice cues that stand out.\nMake the cues of good habits obvious in your\nenvironment.\nGradually , your habits become associated not with a\nsingle trigger but with the entire context surrounding\nthe behavior . The context becomes the cue.\nIt",

Y ou\ncan do the same with your digital spaces. I know a writer\nwho uses his computer only for writing, his tablet only for\nreading, and his phone only for social media and texting.\nEvery habit should have a home.\nIf you can manage to stick with this strategy , each\ncontext will become associated with a particular habit and\nmode of thought. Habits thrive under predictable\ncircumstances like these. F ocus comes automatically when\nyou are sitting at your work desk. Relaxation is easier when\nyou are in a space designed for that purpose. Sleep comes\nquickly when it is the only thing that happens in your\nbedroom. If you want behaviors that are stable and\npredictable, you need an environment that is stable and\npredictable.\nA stable environment where everything has a place and a\npurpose is an environment where habits can easily form.\nChapter Summary\nSmall changes in context can lead to large changes in\nbehavior over time.\nEvery habit is initiated by a cue.
