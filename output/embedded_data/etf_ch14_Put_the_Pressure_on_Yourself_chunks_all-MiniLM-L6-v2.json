The problem is that, \"No one is coming to the rescue.\"\nThese people are waiting for a bus on a street where no busses pass.\nAs a result, if they don't take charge of their lives and put the\npressure on themselves, they can end up waiting forever. And that is\nwhat most people do.\nOnly about 2% of people can work entirely without supervision. We\ncall these people \"leaders.\" This is the kind of person you are meant\nto be, and which you may be, it you decide to.\nTo reach your full potential, you must form the habit of putting the\npressure on yourself, and not waiting for someone else to come along\nand do it for you. You must choose your own frogs and then make\nyourself eat them in their order of importance.\nLead the Field\nSee yourself as a role model for others. Raise the bar on yourself. The\nstandards you set for your own work and behavior should be higher\nthan anyone else could set for you.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 85Make it a game with yourself to start a little earlier, work a little\nharder and stay a little later. Always look for ways to go the extra\nmile, to do more than you are paid for.\nYour self-esteem, the core of your personality, has been defined by\npsychologist Nathaniel Brandon as “your reputation with yourself.\"\nYou build up or pull down your reputation with yourself with\neverything you do, or fail to do. The good news is that you feel betterabout yourself whenever you push yourself to do your best. You\nincrease your own self esteem whenever you go beyond where the\naverage person would normally quit.\nCreate Imaginary Deadlines\nOne of the best ways for you to overcome procrastination is by\nworking as though you only had one day to get your most important\njobs done before you left for a month or went on vacation.\nImagine each day that you have just received an emergency message\nand that you will have to leave town tomorrow for a month. If you\nhad to leave town for a month, what would you absolutely make sure\nthat you got done before you left? Whatever your answer, go to work\non that task right now.\nAnother way to put pressure on yourself is to imagine that you just\nreceived all-expenses paid one-week vacation in a beautiful resort as\na prize, but you will have to leave tomorrow morning on the vacation\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 86or it will be given to someone else. What would you be determined to\nget finished before you left so that you could take that vacation?\nWhatever it is, start on that one job immediately.\nSuccessful people continually put the pressure on themselves to\nperform at high levels. Unsuccessful people have to be instructed and\nsupervised and pressured by others.\nBy putting the pressure on yourself, you accomplish more and better\ntasks, faster than ever before. You become a high performance, high-\nachieving personality. You feel terrific about yourself, and bit by bit,\nyou build up the habit of rapid task completion that then goes on toserve you all the days of your life.\nEat That Frog!\n1.   Set deadlines and sub-deadlines on every task and activity. Create\nyour own “forcing system.” Raise the bar on yourself and don’t let\nyourself off the hook. Once you’ve set yourself a deadline, stick to it\nand even try to beat it.\n2.  Write out every step of a major job or project before you begin.\nDetermine how many minutes and hours you will require to\ncomplete each phase. Then race against your own clock. Beat your\nown deadlines. Make it a game, and resolve to win!",

The problem is that, \"No one is coming to the rescue.\"\nThese people are waiting for a bus on a street where no busses pass.\nAs a result, if they don't take charge of their lives and put the\npressure on themselves, they can end up waiting forever. And that is\nwhat most people do.\nOnly about 2% of people can work entirely without supervision. We\ncall these people \"leaders.\" This is the kind of person you are meant\nto be, and which you may be, it you decide to.\nTo reach your full potential, you must form the habit of putting the\npressure on yourself, and not waiting for someone else to come along\nand do it for you. You must choose your own frogs and then make\nyourself eat them in their order of importance.\nLead the Field\nSee yourself as a role model for others. Raise the bar on yourself. The\nstandards you set for your own work and behavior should be higher\nthan anyone else could set for you.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 85Make it a game with yourself to start a little earlier, work a little\nharder and stay a little later. Always look for ways to go the extra\nmile, to do more than you are paid for.\nYour self-esteem, the core of your personality, has been defined by\npsychologist Nathaniel Brandon as “your reputation with yourself.\"\nYou build up or pull down your reputation with yourself with\neverything you do, or fail to do. The good news is that you feel betterabout yourself whenever you push yourself to do your best. You\nincrease your own self esteem whenever you go beyond where the\naverage person would normally quit.\nCreate Imaginary Deadlines\nOne of the best ways for you to overcome procrastination is by\nworking as though you only had one day to get your most important\njobs done before you left for a month or went on vacation.\nImagine each day that you have just received an emergency message\nand that you will have to leave town tomorrow for a month. If you\nhad to leave town for a month, what",

The problem is that, \"No one is coming to the rescue.\"\nThese people are waiting for a bus on a street where no busses pass.\nAs a result, if they don't take charge of their lives and put the\npressure on themselves, they can end up waiting forever. And that is\nwhat most people do.\nOnly about 2% of people can work entirely without supervision. We\ncall these people \"leaders.\" This is the kind of person you are meant\nto be, and which you may be, it you decide to.\nTo reach your full potential, you must form the habit of putting the\npressure on yourself, and not waiting for someone else to come along\nand do it for you. You must choose your own frogs and then make\nyourself eat them in their order of importance.\nLead the Field\nSee yourself as a role model for others",

If you\nhad to leave town for a month, what would you absolutely make sure\nthat you got done before you left? Whatever your answer, go to work\non that task right now.\nAnother way to put pressure on yourself is to imagine that you just\nreceived all-expenses paid one-week vacation in a beautiful resort as\na prize, but you will have to leave tomorrow morning on the vacation\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 86or it will be given to someone else. What would you be determined to\nget finished before you left so that you could take that vacation?\nWhatever it is, start on that one job immediately.\nSuccessful people continually put the pressure on themselves to\nperform at high levels. Unsuccessful people have to be instructed and\nsupervised and pressured by others.\nBy putting the pressure on yourself, you accomplish more and better\ntasks, faster than ever before. You become a high performance, high-\nachieving personality. You feel terrific about yourself, and bit by bit,\nyou build up the habit of rapid task completion that then goes on toserve you all the days of your life.\nEat That Frog!\n1.   Set deadlines and sub-deadlines on every task and activity. Create\nyour own “forcing system.” Raise the bar on yourself and don’t let\nyourself off the hook. Once you’ve set yourself a deadline, stick to it\nand even try to beat it.\n2.  Write out every step of a major job or project before you begin.\nDetermine how many minutes and hours you will require to\ncomplete each phase. Then race against your own clock. Beat your\nown deadlines. Make it a game, and resolve to win!",
