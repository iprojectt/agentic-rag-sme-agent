Her husband, a land surveyor, often left for work at eight and didn ’t get home until six. The house was empty except for Bachmann. It was the ﬁ  rst time in almost two \n decades— since she had gotten married at nineteen and pregnant by twenty, and her days had become crowded with packing school lunches, playing princess, and basically running a family car shuttle  service— that she felt genuinely alone. In high school, her friends told her she should become a  model— she had been that  pretty— but when she dropped out and then married a guitar player who eventu-\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   245 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   245 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n246 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nally got a real job, she settled on being a mom instead. Now it was \nten-thirty in the morning, her three daughters were gone, and Bach-mann had  resorted— again— to taping a piece of paper over the kitchen clock to stop herself from looking at it every three minutes.\nShe had no idea what to do next.That day, she made a deal with herself: If she could make it until \nnoon without going crazy or eating the cake in the fridge, she would leave the house and do something fun. She spent the next ninety minutes trying to ﬁ  gure out what exactly that would be. When the \nclock hit twelve o’clock, she put on some makeup and a nice dress and drove to a riverboat casino about twenty minutes away from her house. Even at noon on a Thursday, the casino was ﬁ  lled with people \ndoing things besides watching soap operas and folding the laundry. There was a band playing near the entrance. A woman was handing out free cocktails. Bachmann ate shrimp from a buffet. The whole experience felt luxurious, like playing hooky. She made her way to a blackjack table where a dealer patiently explained the rules. When her forty dollars of chips were gone, she glanced at her watch and saw two hours had ﬂ  own by and she needed to hurry home to pick \nup her youngest daughter. That night at dinner, for the ﬁ  rst time in \na month, she had something to talk about besides outguessing a contestant on The Price Is Right .\nAngie Bachmann ’s father was a truck driver who had remade \nhimself, midlife, into a  semi- famous songwriter. Her brother had become a songwriter, too, and had won awards. Bachmann, on the other hand, was often introduced by her parents as “the one who became a mom.”\n“I always felt like the untalented one,” she told me. “I think I’m \nsmart, and I know I was a good mom. But there wasn ’t a lot I could point to and say, that’s why I’m special.”\nAfter that ﬁ  rst trip to the casino, Bachmann started going to the \nriverboat once a week, on Friday afternoons. It was a reward for \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   246 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   246 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Neurology of Free Will ● 247\nmaking it through empty days, keeping the house clean, staying \nsane. She knew gambling could lead to trouble, so she set strict rules for herself. No more than one hour at the blackjack table per trip, and she only gambled what was in her wallet. “I considered it kind of like a job,” she told me. “I never left the house before noon, and I was always home in time to pick up my daughter. I was very disciplined.”\nAnd she got good. At ﬁ  rst, she could hardly make her money last \nan hour. Within six months, however, she had picked up enough tricks that she adjusted her rules to allow for two- or  three- hour shifts, and she would still have cash",

Her husband, a land surveyor, often left for work at eight and didn ’t get home until six. The house was empty except for Bachmann. It was the ﬁ  rst time in almost two \n decades— since she had gotten married at nineteen and pregnant by twenty, and her days had become crowded with packing school lunches, playing princess, and basically running a family car shuttle  service— that she felt genuinely alone. In high school, her friends told her she should become a  model— she had been that  pretty— but when she dropped out and then married a guitar player who eventu-\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   245 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   245 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n246 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nally got a real job, she settled on being a mom instead.

She spent the next ninety minutes trying to ﬁ  gure out what exactly that would be. When the \nclock hit twelve o’clock, she put on some makeup and a nice dress and drove to a riverboat casino about twenty minutes away from her house. Even at noon on a Thursday, the casino was ﬁ  lled with people \ndoing things besides watching soap operas and folding",

Even at noon on a Thursday, the casino was ﬁ  lled with people \ndoing things besides watching soap operas and folding the laundry. There was a band playing near the entrance. A woman was handing out free cocktails. Bachmann ate shrimp from a buffet. The whole experience felt luxurious, like playing hooky. She made her way to a blackjack table where a dealer patiently explained the rules. When her forty dollars of chips were gone, she glanced at her watch and saw two hours had ﬂ  own by and she needed to hurry home to pick \nup her youngest daughter.

She knew gambling could lead to trouble, so she set strict rules for herself. No more than one hour at the blackjack table per trip, and she only gambled what was in her wallet. “I considered it kind of like a job,” she told me. “I never left the house before noon, and I was always home in time to pick up my daughter.

Even at noon on a Thursday, the casino was ﬁ  lled with people \ndoing things besides watching soap operas and folding the laundry. There was a band playing near the entrance. A woman was handing out free cocktails. Bachmann ate shrimp from a buffet. The whole experience felt luxurious, like playing hooky. She made her way to a blackjack table where a dealer patiently explained the rules. When her forty dollars of chips were gone, she glanced at her watch and saw two hours had ﬂ  own by and she needed to hurry home to pick \nup her youngest daughter. That night at dinner, for the ﬁ  rst time in \na month, she had something to talk about besides outguessing a contestant on The Price Is Right .\nAngie Bachmann ’s father was a truck driver who had remade \nhimself, midlife, into a  semi- famous songwriter. Her brother had become a songwriter, too, and had won awards. Bachmann, on the other hand, was often introduced by her parents as “the one who became a mom.”\n“I always felt like the untalented one,”",

Within six months, however, she had picked up enough tricks that she adjusted her rules to allow for two- or  three- hour shifts, and she would still have cash in her pocket when she walked away. One afternoon, she sat down at the blackjack table with $80 in her purse and left with $530—enough to buy groceries, pay the phone bill, and put a bit in the rainy day fund. By then, the company that owned the  casino— Harrah ’s  Entertainment— was sending her coupons for free buffets. She would treat the family to dinner on Saturday nights.\nThe state where Bachmann was gambling, Iowa, had legalized \ngambling only a few years earlier. Prior to 1989, the state’s lawmak-ers worried that the temptations of cards and dice might be difﬁ  cult \nfor some citizens to resist. It was a concern as old as the nation it-self. Gambling “is the child of avarice, the brother of iniquity and the father of mischief,” George Washington wrote in 1783. “This is a vice which is productive of every possible evil. . . . In a word, few gain by this abominable practice, while thousands are injured.” Pro-tecting people from their bad  habits— in fact, deﬁ  ning which habits \nshould be considered “bad” in the ﬁ  rst  place— is a prerogative law-\nmakers have eagerly seized. Prostitution, gambling, liquor sales on the Sabbath, pornography, usurious loans, sexual relations outside of marriage (or, if your tastes are unusual, within marriage), are all habits that various legislatures have regulated, outlawed, or tried to discourage with strict (and often ineffective) laws.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   247 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   247 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n248 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nWhen Iowa legalized casinos, lawmakers were sufﬁ  ciently con-\ncerned that they limited the activity to riverboats and mandated that no one could wager more than $5 per bet, with a maximum loss of $200 per person per cruise. Within a few years, however, after some of the state’s casinos moved to Mississippi where  no- limit gaming was allowed, the Iowa legislature lifted those restrictions. In 2010, the state’s coffers swelled by more than $269 million from taxes on gambling.\n● ● ●\nIn 2000, Angie Bachmann ’s parents, both longtime smokers, started showing signs of lung disease. She began ﬂ  ying to Tennessee to see \nthem every other week, buying groceries and helping to cook din-ner. When she came back home to her husband and daughters, the stretches seemed even lonelier now. Sometimes, the house was empty all day long; it was as if, in her absence, her friends had for-gotten to invite her to things and her family had ﬁ  gured out how to \nget by on their own.\nBachmann was worried about her parents, upset that her husband \nseemed more interested in his work than her anxieties, and resentful of her kids who didn ’t realize she needed them  now, after all the sac-\nriﬁ ces she had made while they were growing up. But whenever she \nhit the casino, those tensions would ﬂ  oat away. She started going a \ncouple times a week when she wasn ’t visiting her parents, and then every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. She still had  rules— but she’d been gambling for years by now, and knew the axioms that serious players lived by. She never put down less than $25 a hand and always played two hands at once. “You have better odds at a higher limit table than at a lower limit table,” she told me. “You have to be able to play through the rough patches until your luck turns. I’ve seen people walk in with $150 and win $10,000. I knew I could do this if I followed \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   248 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   248 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/11   12:02 PM\nThe Neurology of Free Will ● 249\nmy rules.

Within six months, however, she had picked up enough tricks that she adjusted her rules to allow for two- or  three- hour shifts, and she would still have cash in her pocket when she walked away. One afternoon, she sat down at the blackjack table with $80 in her purse and left with $530—enough to buy groceries, pay the phone bill, and put a bit in the rainy day fund. By then, the company that owned the  casino— Harrah ’s  Entertainment— was sending her coupons for free buffets. She would treat the family to dinner on Saturday nights.\nThe state where Bachmann was gambling, Iowa, had legalized \ngambling only a few years earlier. Prior to 1989, the state’s lawmak-ers worried that the temptations of cards and dice might be difﬁ  cult \nfor some citizens to resist. It was a concern as old as the nation it-self. Gambling “is the child of avarice, the brother of iniquity and the father of mischief,” George Washington wrote in 1783. “This is a vice which is productive of every possible evil. . . . In a word, few gain by this abominable practice, while thousands are injured.” Pro-tecting people from their bad  habits— in fact, deﬁ  ning which habits \nshould be considered “bad” in the ﬁ  rst  place— is a prerogative law-\nmakers have eagerly seized. Prostitution, gambling, liquor sales on the Sabbath, pornography, usurious loans, sexual relations outside of marriage (or, if your tastes are unusual, within marriage), are all habits that various legislatures have regulated, outlawed, or tried to discourage with strict (and often ineffective) laws.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   247 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   247 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n248 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nWhen Iowa legalized casinos, lawmakers were sufﬁ  ciently con-\ncerned that they limited the activity to riverboats and mandated that no one could wager more than $5 per bet, with a maximum loss of $200 per person per cruise.

I was in control.”* By then, she didn ’t have to think about \nwhether to take another card or double her  bet— she acted automati-cally, just as Eugene Pauly, the amnesiac, had eventually learned to always choose the right cardboard rectangle.\nOne day in 2000, Bachmann went home from the casino with \n$6,000—enough to pay rent for two months and wipe out the credit card bills that were piling up by the front door. Another time, she walked away with $2,000. Sometimes she lost, but that was part of the game. Smart gamblers knew you had to go down to go up. Even-tually, Harrah ’s gave her a line of credit so she wouldn ’t have to carry so much cash. Other players sought her out and sat at her table be-cause she knew what she was doing. At the buffet, the hosts would let her go to the front of the line. “I know how to play,” she told me. “I know that sounds like somebody who’s got a problem not recog-nizing their problem, but the only mistake I made was not quitting. There wasn ’t anything wrong with how I played.”\nBachmann ’s rules gradually became more ﬂ  exible as the size of \nher winnings and losses expanded. One day, she lost $800 in an hour, and then earned $1,200 in forty minutes. Then her luck turned again and she walked away down $4,000. Another time, she lost $3,500 in the morning, earned $5,000 by 1 \nP.M., and lost another \n$3,000 in the afternoon. The casino had records of how much she owed and what she’d earned; she’d stopped keeping track herself. Then, one month, she didn ’t have enough in her bank account for the electricity bill. She asked her parents for a small loan, and then another. She borrowed $2,000 one month, $2,500 the next. It wasn ’t a big deal; they had the money.\n*It may seem irrational for anyone to believe they can beat the house in a casino. However, as \nregular gamblers know, it is possible to consistently win, particularly at games such as blackjack. Don Johnson of Bensalem, Pennsylvania, for instance, won a reported $15.1 million at blackjack over a six-month span starting in 2010. The house always wins in the aggregate because so many gamblers bet in a manner that doesn ’t maximize their odds, and most people do not have enough money to see themselves through losses. A gambler can consistently win over time, though, if he or she has memorized the complicated formulas and odds that guide how each hand should be played. Most players, however, don ’t have the discipline or mathematical skills to beat the house.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   249 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   249 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/11   12:02 PM\n250 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nBachmann had never had problems with drinking or drugs or \novereating. She was a normal mom, with the same highs and lows as everyone else. So the compulsion she felt to  gamble— the insis-tent pull that made her feel distracted or irritable on days when she didn ’t visit the casino, the way she found herself thinking about it all the time, the rush she felt on a good  run— caught her completely off guard. It was a new sensation, so unexpected that she hardly knew it was a problem until it had taken hold of her life. In retrospect, it seemed like there had been no dividing line. One day it was fun, and the next it was uncontrollable.\nBy 2001, she was going to the casino every day. She went when-\never she fought with her husband or felt unappreciated by her kids. At the tables she was numb and excited, all at once, and her anxi-eties grew so faint she couldn ’t hear them anymore. The high of winning was so immediate. The pain of losing passed so fast.\n“You want to be a big shot,” her mother told her when Bach-\nmann called to borrow more money. “You keep gambling because you want the attention.”\nThat wasn ’t it, though. “I just wanted to feel good at something,” \nshe said to me. “This was the only thing I’d ever done where it seemed like I had a skill.”\nBy the summer of 2001, Bachmann ’s debts to Harrah ’s hit \n$20,000. She had been keeping the losses secret from her husband, but when her",

I was in control.”* By then, she didn ’t have to think about \nwhether to take another card or double her  bet— she acted automati-cally, just as Eugene Pauly, the amnesiac, had eventually learned to always choose the right cardboard rectangle.\nOne day in 2000, Bachmann went home from the casino with \n$6,000—enough to pay rent for two months and wipe out the credit card bills that were piling up by the front door. Another time, she walked away with $2,000. Sometimes she lost, but that was part of the game. Smart gamblers knew you had to go down to go up. Even-tually, Harrah ’s gave her a line of credit so she wouldn ’t have to carry so much cash. Other players sought her out and sat at her table be-cause she knew what she was doing. At the buffet, the hosts would let her go to the front of the line. “I know how to play,” she told me. “I know that sounds like somebody who’s got a problem not recog-nizing their problem, but the only mistake I made was not quitting. There wasn ’t anything wrong with how I played.”\nBachmann ’s rules gradually became more ﬂ  exible as the size of \nher winnings and losses expanded. One day, she lost $800 in an hour, and then earned $1,200 in forty minutes. Then her luck turned again and she walked away down $4,000. Another time, she lost $3,500 in the morning, earned $5,000 by 1 \nP.M., and lost another \n$3,000 in the afternoon. The casino had records of how much she owed and what she’d earned; she’d stopped keeping track herself. Then, one month, she didn ’t have enough in her bank account for the electricity bill. She asked her parents for a small loan, and then another. She borrowed $2,000 one month, $2,500 the next. It wasn ’t a big deal; they had the money.\n*It may seem irrational for anyone to believe they can beat the house in a casino. However, as \nregular gamblers know, it is possible to consistently win, particularly at games such as blackjack. Don Johnson of Bensalem, Pennsylvania, for instance, won a reported $15.1 million at blackjack over a six",

Don Johnson of Bensalem, Pennsylvania, for instance, won a reported $15.1 million at blackjack over a six-month span starting in 2010. The house always wins in the aggregate because so many gamblers bet in a manner that doesn ’t maximize their odds, and most people do not have enough money to see themselves through losses. A gambler can consistently win over time, though, if he or she has memorized the complicated formulas and odds that guide how each hand should be played. Most players, however, don ’t have the discipline or mathematical skills to beat the house.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   249 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   249 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/11   12:02 PM\n250 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nBachmann had never had problems with drinking or drugs or \novereating. She was a normal mom, with the same highs and lows as everyone else.

It was a new sensation, so unexpected that she hardly knew it was a problem until it had taken hold of her life. In retrospect, it seemed like there had been no dividing line. One day it was fun, and the next it was uncontrollable.\nBy 2001, she was going to the casino every day. She went when-\never she fought with her husband or felt unappreciated by her kids. At the tables she was numb and excited, all at once, and her anxi-eties grew so faint she couldn ’t hear them anymore. The high of winning was so immediate. The pain of losing passed so fast.\n“You want to be a big shot,” her mother told her when Bach-\nmann called to borrow more money. “You keep gambling because you want the attention.”\nThat wasn ’t it, though. “I just wanted to feel good at something,” \nshe said to me. “This was the only thing I’d",

She had been keeping the losses secret from her husband, but when her mother ﬁ  nally cut off the stipends, she broke down Routine\nReward CueCRAVING \nFOR \nNUMBNESS\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   250 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   250 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/11   12:02 PM\nThe Neurology of Free Will ● 251\nand confessed. They hired a bankruptcy attorney, cut up her credit \ncards, and sat at the kitchen table to write out a plan for a more aus-tere, responsible life. She took her dresses to a used clothing store and withstood the humiliation of a  nineteen- year- old turning down almost all of them because, she said, they were out of style.\nEventually, it started to feel like the worst was over. Finally, she \nthought, the compulsion was gone.\nBut, of course, it wasn ’t even close to the end. Years later, after \nshe had lost everything and had ruined her life and her husband’s, after she had thrown away hundreds of thousands of dollars and her lawyer had argued before the state’s highest court that Angie Bach-mann gambled not by choice, but out of habit, and thus shouldn ’t bear culpability for her losses, after she had become an object of scorn on the Internet, where people compared her to Jeffrey Dah-mer and parents who abuse their kids, she would wonder: How much responsibility do I actually bear?\n“I honestly believe anyone in my shoes would have done the \nsame things,” Bachmann told me.\nII.\nOn a July morning in 2008, a desperate man vacationing along the west coast of Wales picked up the phone and called an emergency operator.\n“I think I’ve killed my wife,” he said. “Oh my God. I thought \nsomeone had broken in. I was ﬁ  ghting with those boys but it was \nChristine. I must have been dreaming or something. What have I done? What have I done?”\nTen minutes later, police ofﬁ  cers arrived to ﬁ  nd Brian Thomas \ncrying next to his camper van. The previous night, he explained, he and his wife had been sleeping in the van when young men racing around the parking lot had awoken them. They moved their camper to the edge of the lot and went back to sleep. Then, a few hours later, \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   251 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   251 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/11   12:02 PM\n252 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nThomas woke to ﬁ  nd a man in jeans and a black  ﬂ  eece— one of the \nracers, he  thought— lying on top of his wife. He screamed at the man, grabbed him by the throat, and tried to pull him off. It was as if he was reacting automatically, he told the police. The more the man struggled, the harder Thomas squeezed. The man scratched at Thomas’s arm and tried to ﬁ  ght back, but Thomas choked, tighter \nand tighter, and eventually the man stopped moving. Then, Thomas realized it wasn ’t a man in his hands, but his wife. He dropped her body and began gently nudging her shoulder, trying to wake her, asking if she was all right. It was too late.\n“I thought somebody had broken in and I strangled her,” Thomas \ntold the police, sobbing. “She’s my world.”\nFor the next ten months, as Thomas sat in prison awaiting trial, \na portrait of the murderer emerged. As a child, Thomas had started sleepwalking, sometimes multiple times each night. He would get out of bed, walk around the house and play with toys or ﬁ  x himself \nsomething to eat and, the next morning, remember nothing about what he had done. It became a family joke. Once a week, it seemed, he would wander into the yard or someone else’s room, all while asleep. It was a habit, his mother would explain when neighbors asked why her son was walking across their lawns, barefoot and in his pajamas. As he grew older, he would wake up with cuts on his feet and no memories of where they had come from. He once swam in a canal in his sleep. After he married, his wife grew so concerned about the possibility that he",

What have I done?”\nTen minutes later, police ofﬁ  cers arrived to ﬁ  nd Brian Thomas \ncrying next to his camper van. The previous night, he explained, he and his wife had been sleeping in the van when young men racing around the parking lot had awoken them. They moved their camper to the edge of the lot and went back to sleep. Then, a few hours later, \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   251 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   251 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/11   12:02 PM\n252 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nThomas woke to ﬁ  nd a man in jeans and a black  ﬂ  eece— one of the \nracers, he  thought— lying on top of his wife. He screamed at the man, grabbed him by the throat, and tried to pull him off. It was as if he was reacting automatically, he told the police. The more the man struggled, the harder Thomas squeezed. The man scratched at Thomas’s arm and tried to ﬁ  ght back, but Thomas choked, tighter \nand tighter, and eventually the man stopped moving. Then, Thomas realized it wasn ’t a man in his hands, but his wife. He dropped her body and began gently nudging her shoulder, trying to wake her, asking if she was all right. It was too late.\n“I thought somebody had broken in and I strangled her,” Thomas \ntold the police, sobbing. “She’s my world.”\nFor the next ten months, as Thomas sat in prison awaiting trial, \na portrait of the murderer emerged. As a child, Thomas had started sleepwalking, sometimes multiple times each night. He would get out of bed, walk around the house and play with toys or ﬁ  x himself \nsomething to eat and, the next morning, remember nothing about what he had done. It became a family joke. Once a week, it seemed, he would wander into the yard or someone else’s room, all while asleep. It was a habit, his mother would explain when neighbors asked why her son was walking across their lawns, barefoot and in his pajamas",

After he married, his wife grew so concerned about the possibility that he might stumble out of the house and into trafﬁ  c that she locked the door and slept with the keys under \nher pillow. Every night, the couple would crawl into bed and “have a kiss and a cuddle,” Thomas later said, and then he would go to his own room and sleep in his own bed. Otherwise his restless tossing and turning, the shouting and grunting and occasional wanderings, would keep Christine up all night.\n“Sleepwalking is a reminder that wake and sleep are not mutu-\nally exclusive,” Mark Mahowald, a professor of neurology at the Uni-\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   252 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   252 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/11   12:02 PM\nThe Neurology of Free Will ● 253\nversity of Minnesota and a pioneer in understanding sleep behaviors, \ntold me. “The part of your brain that monitors your behavior is asleep, but the parts capable of very complex activities are awake. The problem is that there’s nothing guiding the brain except for basic patterns, your most basic habits. You follow what exists in your head, because you’re not capable of making a choice.”\nBy law, the police had to prosecute Thomas for the murder. But all \nevidence seemed to indicate that he and his wife had a happy mar-riage prior to that awful night. There wasn ’t any history of abuse. They had two grown daughters and had recently booked a Mediter-ranean cruise to celebrate their fortieth wedding anniversary. Prose-cutors asked a sleep  specialist— Dr. Chris Idzikowski of the Edinburgh Sleep  Centre— to examine Thomas and evaluate a theory: that he had been unconscious when he killed his wife. In two separate sessions, one in Idzikowski’s laboratory and the other inside the prison, the researcher applied sensors all over Thomas’s body and measured his brain waves, eye movement, chin and leg muscles, nasal airﬂ  ow, re-\nspiratory effort, and oxygen levels while he slept.\nThomas wasn ’t the ﬁ  rst person to argue that he had committed a \ncrime while sleeping and thus, by extension, should not be held re-sponsible for his deed. There’s a long history of wrongdoers contend-ing they aren ’t culpable due to “automatism,” as sleepwalking and other unconscious behaviors are known. And in the past decade, as our understanding of the neurology of habits and free will has be-come more sophisticated, those defenses have become more com-pelling. Society, as embodied by our courts and juries, has agreed that some habits are so powerful that they overwhelm our capacity to make choices, and thus we’re not responsible for what we do.\n● ● ●\nSleepwalking is an odd outgrowth of a normal aspect of how our brains work while we slumber. Most of the time, as our bodies move \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   253 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   253 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/11   12:02 PM\n254 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nin and out of different phases of rest, our most primitive neurologi-\ncal  structure— the brain  stem— paralyzes our limbs and nervous system, allowing our brains to experience dreams without our bod-ies moving. Usually, people can make the transition in and out of paralysis multiple times each night without any problems. Within neurology, it’s known as the “switch.”\nSome people’s brains, though, experience switching errors. They \ngo into incomplete paralysis as they sleep, and their bodies are ac-tive while they dream or pass between sleep phases. This is the root cause of sleepwalking and for the majority of sufferers, it is an an-noying but benign problem. Someone might dream about eating a cake, for instance, and the next morning ﬁ  nd a ravaged box of \ndoughnuts in the kitchen. Someone will dream about going to the bathroom, and later discover a wet spot in the hall. Sleepwalkers can behave in complex  ways— for instance, they can open their eyes, see, move around, and drive a car or cook a  meal— all while essen-tially unconscious, because the parts of their brain associated with seeing, walking, driving, and cooking can function while they are asleep without input from the brain ’s more advanced regions, such as",

After he married, his wife grew so concerned about the possibility that he might stumble out of the house and into trafﬁ  c that she locked the door and slept with the keys under \nher pillow. Every night, the couple would crawl into bed and “have a kiss and a cuddle,” Thomas later said, and then he would go to his own room and sleep in his own bed. Otherwise his restless tossing and turning, the shouting and grunting and occasional wanderings, would keep Christine up all night.\n“Sleepwalking is a reminder that wake and sleep are not mutu-\nally exclusive,” Mark Mahowald, a professor of neurology at the Uni-\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   252 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   252 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/11   12:02 PM\nThe Neurology of Free Will ● 253\nversity of Minnesota and a pioneer in understanding sleep behaviors, \ntold me. “The part of your brain that monitors your behavior is asleep, but the parts capable of very complex activities are awake. The problem is that there’s nothing guiding the brain except for basic patterns, your most basic habits. You follow what exists in your head, because you’re not capable of making a choice.”\nBy law, the police had to prosecute Thomas for the murder. But all \nevidence seemed to indicate that he and his wife had a happy mar-riage prior to that awful night. There wasn ’t any history of abuse. They had two grown daughters and had recently booked a Mediter-ranean cruise to celebrate their fortieth wedding anniversary. Prose-cutors asked a sleep  specialist— Dr. Chris Idzikowski of the Edinburgh Sleep  Centre— to examine Thomas and evaluate a theory: that he had been unconscious when he killed his wife. In two separate sessions, one in Idzikowski’s laboratory and the other inside the prison, the researcher applied sensors all over Thomas’s body and measured his brain waves, eye movement, chin and leg muscles, nasal airﬂ  ow, re-\nspiratory effort, and oxygen levels while he slept.\nThomas wasn ’t the ﬁ  rst",

There’s a long history of wrongdoers contend-ing they aren ’t culpable due to “automatism,” as sleepwalking and other unconscious behaviors are known. And in the past decade, as our understanding of the neurology of habits and free will has be-come more sophisticated, those defenses have become more com-pelling. Society, as embodied by our courts and juries, has agreed that some habits are so powerful that they overwhelm our capacity to make choices, and thus we’re not responsible for what we do.\n● ● ●\nSleepwalking is an odd outgrowth of a normal aspect of how our brains work while we slumber.

Usually, people can make the transition in and out of paralysis multiple times each night without any problems. Within neurology, it’s known as the “switch.”\nSome people’s brains, though, experience switching errors. They \ngo into incomplete paralysis as they sleep, and their bodies are ac-tive while they dream or pass between sleep phases. This is the root cause of sleepwalking and for the majority of sufferers, it is an an-noying but benign problem. Someone might dream about eating a cake, for instance, and the next morning ﬁ  nd a ravaged box of \ndoughnuts in the kitchen. Someone will dream about going to the bathroom, and later discover a wet spot in the hall. Sleepwalkers can behave in complex  ways— for instance, they can open their eyes, see, move around, and drive",

    "text": " sensors all over Thomas’s body and measured his brain waves, eye movement, chin and leg muscles, nasal airﬂ  ow, re-\nspiratory effort, and oxygen levels while he slept.\nThomas wasn ’t the ﬁ  rst person to argue that he had committed a \ncrime while sleeping and thus, by extension, should not be held re-sponsible for his deed. There’s a long history of wrongdoers contend-ing they aren ’t culpable due to “automatism,” as sleepwalking and other unconscious behaviors are known. And in the past decade, as our understanding of the neurology of habits and free will has be-come more sophisticated, those defenses have become more com-pelling. Society, as embodied by our courts and juries, has agreed that some habits are so powerful that they overwhelm our capacity to make choices, and thus we’re not responsible for what we do.\n● ● ●\nSleepwalking is an odd outgrowth of a normal aspect of how our brains work while we slumber.

Sleepwalkers have been known to boil water and make tea. One operated a motorboat. Another turned on an electric saw and started feeding in pieces of wood before going back to bed. But in general, sleepwalkers will not do things that are dan-gerous to themselves or others. Even asleep, there’s an instinct to avoid peril.\nHowever, as scientists have examined the brains of sleepwalkers, \nthey’ve found a distinction between  sleepwalking — in which people \nmight leave their beds and start acting out their dreams or other mild  impulses— and something called sleep terrors . When a sleep terror \noccurs, the activity inside people’s brains is markedly different from when they are awake,  semi- conscious, or even sleepwalking. People in the midst of sleep terrors seem to be in the grip of terrible anxiet-ies, but are not dreaming in the normal sense of the word.

To a neurologist, in fact, a brain experiencing a sleep ter-ror looks very similar to a brain following a habit.\nThe behaviors of people in the grip of sleep terrors are habits, \nthough of the most primal kind. The “central pattern generators” at work during a sleep terror are where such behavioral patterns as walking, breathing, ﬂ  inching from a loud noise, or ﬁ  ghting an at-\ntacker come from. We don ’t usually think about these behaviors as habits, but that’s what they are: automatic behaviors so ingrained in our neurology that, studies show, they can occur with almost no input from the higher regions of the brain.\nHowever, these habits, when they occur during sleep terrors, are \ndifferent in one critical respect: Because sleep deactivates the pre-frontal cortex and other high cognition areas, when a sleep terror habit is triggered, there is no possibility of conscious intervention. If the  ﬁ  ght- or- ﬂ  ight habit is cued by a sleep terror, there is no chance \nthat someone can override it through logic or reason.\n“People with sleep terrors aren ’t dreaming in the normal sense,” \nsaid Mahowald, the neurologist. “There’s no complex plots like you and I remember from a nightmare. If they remember anything af-terward, it’s just an image or  emotions— impending doom, horrible fear, the need to defend themselves or someone else.\n“Those emotions are really powerful, though. They are some of \nthe most basic cues for all kinds of behaviors we’ve learned through-out our lives. Responding to a threat by running away or defending ourselves is something everyone has practiced since they were ba-bies. And when those emotions occur, and there’s no chance for the higher brain to put things in context, we react the way our deepest habits tell us to. We run or ﬁ  ght or follow whatever behavioral pat-\ntern is easiest for our brains to latch on to.”\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   255 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   255 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/11   12:02 PM\n256 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nWhen someone in the midst of a sleep terror starts feeling threat-\nened or sexually  aroused— two of the most common sleep terror  experiences— they react by following the habits associated with those stimuli.\n People experiencing sleep terrors have jumped off of \ntall roofs because they believed they were ﬂ  eeing from attackers. \nThey have killed their own babies because, they believed, they were ﬁ ghting wild animals. They have raped their spouses, even as their \nvictims begged them to stop, because once the sleepers’ arousal began, they followed the ingrained habit to satisfy the urge. Sleep-walking seems to allow some choice, some participation by our higher brains that tell us to stay away from the",

Sleepwalkers have been known to boil water and make tea. One operated a motorboat. Another turned on an electric saw and started feeding in pieces of wood before going back to bed. But in general, sleepwalkers will not do things that are dan-gerous to themselves or others. Even asleep, there’s an instinct to avoid peril.\nHowever, as scientists have examined the brains of sleepwalkers, \nthey’ve found a distinction between  sleepwalking — in which people \nmight leave their beds and start acting out their dreams or other mild  impulses— and something called sleep terrors . When a sleep terror \noccurs, the activity inside people’s brains is markedly different from when they are awake,  semi- conscious, or even sleepwalking. People in the midst of sleep terrors seem to be in the grip of terrible anxiet-ies, but are not dreaming in the normal sense of the word.

To a neurologist, in fact, a brain experiencing a sleep ter-ror looks very similar to a brain following a habit.\nThe behaviors of people in the grip of sleep terrors are habits, \nthough of the most primal kind. The “central pattern generators” at work during a sleep terror are where such behavioral patterns as walking, breathing, ﬂ  inching from a loud noise, or ﬁ  ghting an at-\ntacker come from. We don ’t usually think about these behaviors as habits, but that’s what they are: automatic behaviors so ingrained in our neurology that, studies show, they can occur with almost no",

We don ’t usually think about these behaviors as habits, but that’s what they are: automatic behaviors so ingrained in our neurology that, studies show, they can occur with almost no input from the higher regions of the brain.\nHowever, these habits, when they occur during sleep terrors, are \ndifferent in one critical respect: Because sleep deactivates the pre-frontal cortex and other high cognition areas, when a sleep terror habit is triggered, there is no possibility of conscious intervention. If the  ﬁ  ght- or- ﬂ  ight habit is cued by a sleep terror, there is no chance \nthat someone can override it through logic or reason.\n“People with sleep terrors aren ’t dreaming in the normal sense,” \nsaid Mahowald, the neurologist. “There’s no complex plots like you and I remember from a nightmare. If they remember anything af-terward, it’s just an image or  emotions— impending doom, horrible fear, the need to defend themselves or someone else.\n“Those emotions are really powerful, though. They are some of \nthe most basic cues for all kinds of behaviors we’ve learned through-out our lives. Responding to a threat by running away or defending ourselves is something everyone has practiced since they were ba-bies. And when those emotions occur, and there’s no chance for the higher brain to put things in context, we react the way our deepest habits tell us to. We run or ﬁ  ght or follow whatever behavioral pat-\ntern is easiest for our brains to latch on to.”\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   255 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   255 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/11   12:02 PM\n256 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nWhen someone in the midst of a sleep terror starts feeling threat-\nened or sexually  aroused— two of the most common sleep terror  experiences— they react by following the habits associated with those stimuli.\n People experiencing sleep terrors have jumped off of \ntall roofs because they believed they were ﬂ  eeing from attackers. \nThey have killed their own babies because, they believed, they were ﬁ ghting wild animals.

Sleep-walking seems to allow some choice, some participation by our higher brains that tell us to stay away from the edge of the roof. Someone in the grip of a sleep terror, however, simply follows the habit loop no matter where it leads.\nSome scientists suspect sleep terrors might be genetic; others \nsay diseases such as Parkinson ’s make them more likely. Their causes aren ’t well understood, but for a number of people, sleep ter-rors involve violent impulses. “Violence related to sleep terrors ap-pears to be a reaction to a concrete, frightening image that the individual can subsequently describe,” a group of Swiss researchers wrote in 2009. Among people suffering one type of sleep dysfunc-tion, “attempted assault of sleep partners has been reported to occur in 64% of cases, with injuries in 3%.”\nIn both the United States and the United Kingdom, there is a Routine\nReward Cue\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   256 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   256 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/11   12:02 PM\nThe Neurology of Free Will ● 257\nhistory of murderers arguing that sleep terrors caused them to com-\nmit crimes they would have never consciously carried out. Four years before Thomas was arrested, for instance, a man named Jules Lowe was found not guilty of murdering his  eighty- three- year- old father after claiming that the attack occurred during a sleep terror. Prosecutors argued it was  “far- fetched in the extreme” to believe that Lowe was asleep while he punched, kicked, and stamped his father for more than twenty minutes, leaving him with over ninety inju-ries. The jury disagreed and set him free. In September 2008,  thirty- three- year-old Donna  Sheppard- Saunders nearly suffocated her \nmother by holding a pillow over her face for thirty seconds. She was later acquitted of attempted murder by arguing that she had acted while asleep. In 2009, a British soldier admitted to raping a teenage girl, but said he was asleep and unconscious while he undressed himself, pulled down her pants, and began having sex. When he woke,  mid- rape, he apologized and called the police. “I’ve just sort of committed a crime,” he told the emergency operator. “I honestly don ’t know what happened. I woke up on top of her.” He had a his-tory of suffering from sleep terrors and was found not guilty. More than 150 murderers and rapists have escaped punishment in the past century using the automatism defense. Judges and juries, act-ing on behalf of society, have said that since the criminals didn ’t choose  to commit their  crimes— since they didn ’t consciously par-\nticipate in the  violence— they shouldn ’t bear the blame.\nFor Brian Thomas, it also looked like a situation where a sleep \ndisorder, rather than a murderous impulse, was at fault. “I’ll never forgive myself, ever,” he told one of the prosecutors. “Why did I do it?”\n● ● ●\nAfter Dr. Idzikowski, the sleep specialist, observed Thomas in his laboratory, he submitted his ﬁ  ndings: Thomas was asleep when he \nkilled his wife. He hadn ’t consciously committed a crime.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   257 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   257 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/11   12:02 PM\n258 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nAs the trial started, prosecutors presented their evidence to the \njury. Thomas had admitted to murdering his wife, they told jurors. He knew he had a history of sleepwalking. His failure to take pre-cautions while on vacation, they said, made him responsible for his crime.\nBut as arguments proceeded, it became clear prosecutors were \nﬁ ghting an uphill battle. Thomas’s lawyer argued that his client \nhadn ’t meant to kill his  wife— in fact, he wasn ’t even in control of his own actions that night. Instead, he was reacting automatically to a perceived threat. He was following a habit almost as old as our spe-cies: the instinct to ﬁ  ght an attacker and protect a loved one. Once \nthe most primitive parts of his brain were exposed to a  cue— someone strangling his  wife— his habit took over and he fought back, with no chance of his higher cognition interceding. Thomas was guilty of nothing",

Sleep-walking seems to allow some choice, some participation by our higher brains that tell us to stay away from the edge of the roof. Someone in the grip of a sleep terror, however, simply follows the habit loop no matter where it leads.\nSome scientists suspect sleep terrors might be genetic; others \nsay diseases such as Parkinson ’s make them more likely. Their causes aren ’t well understood, but for a number of people, sleep ter-rors involve violent impulses. “Violence related to sleep terrors ap-pears to be a reaction to a concrete, frightening image that the individual can subsequently describe,” a group of Swiss researchers wrote in 2009. Among people suffering one type of sleep dysfunc-tion, “attempted assault of sleep partners has been reported to occur in 64% of cases, with injuries in 3%.”\nIn both the United States and the United Kingdom, there is a Routine\nReward Cue\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   256 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   256 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/11   12:02 PM\nThe Neurology of Free Will ● 257\nhistory of murderers arguing that sleep terrors caused them to com-\nmit crimes they would have never consciously carried out. Four years before Thomas was arrested, for instance, a man named Jules Lowe was found not guilty of murdering his  eighty- three- year- old father after claiming that the attack occurred during a sleep terror. Prosecutors argued it was  “far- fetched in the extreme” to believe that Lowe was asleep while he punched, kicked, and stamped his father for more than twenty minutes, leaving him with over ninety inju-ries. The jury disagreed and set him free. In September 2008,  thirty- three- year-old Donna  Sheppard- Saunders nearly suffocated her \nmother by holding a pillow over her face for thirty seconds. She was later acquitted of attempted murder by arguing that she had acted while asleep. In 2009, a British soldier admitted to raping a teenage girl, but said he was asleep and unconscious while he undressed himself, pulled down her pants, and began having sex. When he woke,  mid-",

    "text": " had acted while asleep. In 2009, a British soldier admitted to raping a teenage girl, but said he was asleep and unconscious while he undressed himself, pulled down her pants, and began having sex. When he woke,  mid- rape, he apologized and called the police. “I’ve just sort of committed a crime,” he told the emergency operator. “I honestly don ’t know what happened. I woke up on top of her.” He had a his-tory of suffering from sleep terrors and was found not guilty. More than 150 murderers and rapists have escaped punishment in the past century using the automatism defense. Judges and juries, act-ing on behalf of society, have said that since the criminals didn ’t choose  to commit their  crimes— since they didn ’t consciously par-\nticipate in the  violence— they shouldn ’t bear the blame.\nFor Brian Thomas, it also looked like a situation where a sleep \ndisorder, rather than a murderous impulse, was at fault. “I’ll never forgive myself, ever,” he told one of the prosecutors. “Why did I do it?”\n● ● ●\nAfter Dr. Idzikowski, the sleep specialist, observed Thomas in his laboratory, he submitted his ﬁ  ndings: Thomas was asleep when he \nkilled his wife. He hadn ’t consciously committed a crime.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   257 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   257 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/11   12:02 PM\n258 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nAs the trial started, prosecutors presented their evidence to the \njury. Thomas had admitted to murdering his wife, they told jurors. He knew he had a history of sleepwalking. His failure to take pre-cautions while on vacation, they said, made him responsible for his crime.\nBut as arguments proceeded, it became clear prosecutors were \nﬁ ghting an uphill battle. Thomas’s lawyer argued that his client \nhadn ’t meant to kill his  wife— in fact, he wasn ’t even in control of his own actions that night. Instead, he was reacting automatically to a perceived threat. He was following a habit almost as old as our spe-cies: the instinct to ﬁ  ght an attacker and protect a loved",

In 2009, a British soldier admitted to raping a teenage girl, but said he was asleep and unconscious while he undressed himself, pulled down her pants, and began having sex. When he woke,  mid- rape, he apologized and called the police. “I’ve just sort of committed a crime,” he told the emergency operator. “I honestly don ’t know what happened. I woke up on top of her.” He had a his-tory of suffering from sleep terrors and was found not guilty. More than 150 murderers and rapists have escaped punishment in the past century using the automatism defense. Judges and juries, act-ing on behalf of society, have said that since the criminals didn ’t choose  to commit their  crimes— since they didn ’t consciously par-\nticipate in the  violence— they shouldn ’t bear the blame.\nFor Brian Thomas, it also looked like a situation where a sleep \ndisorder, rather than a murderous impulse, was at fault. “I’ll never forgive myself, ever,” he told one of the prosecutors. “Why did I do it?”\n● ● ●\nAfter Dr. Idzikowski, the sleep specialist, observed Thomas in his laboratory",

Once \nthe most primitive parts of his brain were exposed to a  cue— someone strangling his  wife— his habit took over and he fought back, with no chance of his higher cognition interceding. Thomas was guilty of nothing more than being human, the lawyer argued, and reacting in the way his  neurology— and most primitive  habits— forced him to behave.\nEven the prosecution ’s own witnesses seemed to bolster the de-\nfense. Though Thomas had known he was capable of sleepwalking, the prosecution ’s own psychiatrists said, there was nothing to sug-gest to him that it was therefore foreseeable he might kill. He had never attacked anyone in his sleep before. He had never previously harmed his wife.\nWhen the prosecution ’s chief psychiatrist took the stand, Thom-\nas’s lawyer began his  cross- examination.\nDid it seem fair that Thomas should be found guilty for an act he \ncould not know was going to occur?\nIn her opinion, said Dr. Caroline Jacob, Thomas could not have \nreasonably anticipated his crime. And if he was convicted and sen-tenced to Broadmoor Hospital, where some of Britain ’s most dan-gerous and mentally ill criminals were housed, well, “he does not belong there.”\nThe next morning, the head prosecutor addressed the jury.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   258 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   258 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/11   12:02 PM\nThe Neurology of Free Will ● 259\n“ At the time of the killing the defendant was asleep and his mind \nhad no control over what his body was doing,” he said. “We have reached the conclusion that the public interest would no longer be served by continuing to seek a special verdict from you. We there-fore offer no further evidence and invite you to return a straight not guilty verdict.” The jury did so.\nBefore Thomas was set free, the judge told him, “You are a de-\ncent man and a devoted husband. I strongly suspect you may well be feeling a sense of guilt. In the eyes of the law you bear no responsi-bility. You are discharged.”\nIt seems like a fair outcome. After all, Thomas was obviously \ndevastated by his crime. He had no idea what he was doing when he  acted— he was simply following a habit, and his capacity for deci-sion making was, in effect, incapacitated. Thomas is the most sym-pathetic murderer conceivable, someone so close to being a victim himself that when the trial ended, the judge tried to console him.\nYet many of those same excuses can be made for Angie Bach-\nmann, the gambler. She was also devastated by her actions. She would later say she carries a deep sense of guilt. And as it turns out, she was also following deeply ingrained habits that made it increas-ingly difﬁ  cult for decision making to intervene.\nBut in the eyes of the law Bachmann is responsible for her hab-\nits, and Thomas isn ’t. Is it right that Bachmann, a gambler, is guilt-ier than Thomas, a murderer? What does that tell us about the ethics of habit and choice?\nIII.\nThree years after Angie Bachmann declared bankruptcy, her father passed away. She’d spent the previous half decade ﬂ  ying between \nher home and her parents’ house, tending to them as they became increasingly ill. His death was a blow. Then, two months later, her mother died.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   259 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   259 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/11   12:02 PM\n260 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\n“My entire world disintegrated,” she said. “I would wake up every \nmorning, and for a second forget they had passed, and then it would rush in that they were gone and I’d feel like someone was standing on my chest. I couldn ’t think about anything else. I didn ’t know what to do when I got out of bed.”\nWhen their wills were read, Bachmann learned she had inher-\nited almost $1 million.\nShe used $275,000 to buy her family a new home in Tennessee, \nnear where her mother and father had lived, and spent a bit more to move her grown daughters nearby so everyone was close. Casino gambling wasn ’t legal in Tennessee, and “I didn ’t want to fall back into bad patterns,” she told me. “I wanted to live away from any-thing that reminded me of feeling out of control.” She changed her phone numbers and",

Once \nthe most primitive parts of his brain were exposed to a  cue— someone strangling his  wife— his habit took over and he fought back, with no chance of his higher cognition interceding. Thomas was guilty of nothing more than being human, the lawyer argued, and reacting in the way his  neurology— and most primitive  habits— forced him to behave.\nEven the prosecution ’s own witnesses seemed to bolster the de-\nfense. Though Thomas had known he was capable of sleepwalking, the prosecution ’s own psychiatrists said, there was nothing to sug-gest to him that it was therefore foreseeable he might kill. He had never attacked anyone in his sleep before. He had never previously harmed his wife.\nWhen the prosecution ’s chief psychiatrist took the stand, Thom-\nas’s lawyer began his  cross- examination.\nDid it seem fair that Thomas should be found guilty for an act he \ncould not know was going to occur?\nIn her opinion, said Dr. Caroline Jacob, Thomas could not have \nreasonably anticipated his crime. And if he was convicted and sen-tenced to Broadmoor Hospital, where some of Britain ’s most dan-gerous and mentally ill criminals were housed, well, “he does not belong there.”\nThe next morning, the head prosecutor addressed the jury.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   258 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   258 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/11   12:02 PM\nThe Neurology of Free Will ● 259\n“ At the time of the killing the defendant was asleep and his mind \nhad no control over what his body was doing,” he said. “We have reached the conclusion that the public interest would no longer be served by continuing to seek a special verdict from you. We there-fore offer no further evidence and invite you to return a straight not guilty verdict.” The jury did so.\nBefore Thomas was set free, the judge told him, “You are a de-\ncent man and a devoted husband. I strongly suspect you may well be feeling a sense of guilt. In the eyes of the law you bear no responsi-bility. You are discharged.”\nIt seems like a fair outcome. After all, Thomas was obviously \ndevastated by his crime. He had no idea what he was doing when he  acted",

    "text": " the eyes of the law you bear no responsi-bility. You are discharged.”\nIt seems like a fair outcome. After all, Thomas was obviously \ndevastated by his crime. He had no idea what he was doing when he  acted— he was simply following a habit, and his capacity for deci-sion making was, in effect, incapacitated. Thomas is the most sym-pathetic murderer conceivable, someone so close to being a victim himself that when the trial ended, the judge tried to console him.\nYet many of those same excuses can be made for Angie Bach-\nmann, the gambler. She was also devastated by her actions. She would later say she carries a deep sense of guilt. And as it turns out, she was also following deeply ingrained habits that made it increas-ingly difﬁ  cult for decision making to intervene.\nBut in the eyes of the law Bachmann is responsible for her hab-\nits, and Thomas isn ’t. Is it right that Bachmann, a gambler, is guilt-ier than Thomas, a murderer? What does that tell us about the ethics of habit and choice?\nIII.\nThree years after Angie Bachmann declared bankruptcy, her father passed away. She’d spent the previous half decade ﬂ  ying between \nher home and her parents’ house, tending to them as they became increasingly ill. His death was a blow. Then, two months later, her mother died.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   259 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   259 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/11   12:02 PM\n260 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\n“My entire world disintegrated,” she said. “I would wake up every \nmorning, and for a second forget they had passed, and then it would rush in that they were gone and I’d feel like someone was standing on my chest. I couldn ’t think about anything else. I didn ’t know what to do when I got out of bed.”\nWhen their wills were read, Bachmann learned she had inher-\nited almost $1 million.\nShe used $275,000 to buy her family a new home in Tennessee, \nnear where her mother and father had lived, and spent a bit more to move her grown daughters nearby so everyone was close.

It felt safer that way.\nThen one night, driving through her old hometown with her \nhusband, picking up the last of their furniture from her previous home, she started thinking about her parents. How would she man-age without them? Why hadn ’t she been a better daughter? She began hyperventilating. It felt like the beginning of a panic attack. It had been years since she had gambled, but in that moment she felt like she needed to ﬁ  nd something to take her mind off the pain. She \nlooked at her husband. She was desperate. This was a one-time thing.\n“Let’s go to the casino,” she said.When they walked in, one of the managers recognized her from \nwhen she was a regular and invited them into the players’ lounge. He asked how she had been, and it all came tumbling out: her par-ents’ passing and how hard it had hit her, how exhausted she was all the time, how she felt like she was on the verge of a breakdown. The manager was a good listener. It felt so good to ﬁ  nally say everything \nshe had been thinking and be told that it was normal to feel this way.\nThen she sat down at a blackjack table and played for three hours. \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   260 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   260 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/11   12:02 PM\nThe Neurology of Free Will ● 261\nFor the ﬁ  rst time in months, the anxiety faded into background \nnoise. She knew how to do this. She went blank. She lost a few thou-sand dollars.\nHarrah ’s  Entertainment— the company that owned the  casino— \nwas known within the gaming industry for the sophistication of its  customer- tracking systems. At the core of that system were com-puter programs much like those Andrew Pole created at Target, pre-dictive algorithms that studied gamblers’ habits and tried to ﬁ  gure \nout how to persuade them to spend more. The company assigned players a “predicted lifetime value,” and software built calendars that anticipated how often they would visit and how much they would spend. The company tracked customers through loyalty cards and mailed out coupons for free meals and cash vouchers; telemar-keters called people at home to ask where they had been. Casino employees were trained to encourage visitors to discuss their lives, in the hopes they might reveal information that could be used to predict how much they had to gamble with. One Harrah ’s executive called this approach “Pavlovian marketing.” The company ran thou-sands of tests each year to perfect their methods.\n Customer tracking \nhad increased the company’s proﬁ  ts by billions of dollars, and was \nso precise they could track a gambler’s spending to the cent and minute.\n*\nHarrah ’s, of course, was well aware that Bachmann had declared \nbankruptcy a few years earlier and had walked away from $20,000 in gambling debts. But soon after her conversation with the casino manager, she began receiving phone calls with offers of free limos that would take her to casinos in Mississippi. They offered to ﬂ  y her \nand her husband to Lake Tahoe, put them in a suite, and give them tickets to an Eagles concert. “I said my daughter has to come, and she wants to bring a friend,” Bachmann said. No problem, the com-pany replied. Everyone’s airfare and rooms were free. At the concert, \n*Harrah ’s—now known as Caesars Entertainment—disputes some of Bachmann ’s allegations. \nTheir comments can be found in the notes.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   261 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   261 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/11   12:02 PM\n262 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nshe sat in the front row. Harrah ’s gave her $10,000 to play with, com-\npliments of the house.\nThe offers kept coming. Every week another casino called, asking \nif she wanted a limo, entry to shows, plane tickets. Bachmann re-sisted at ﬁ  rst, but eventually she started saying yes each time an in-\nvitation arrived. When a family friend mentioned that",

She knew how to do this. She went blank. She lost a few thou-sand dollars.\nHarrah ’s  Entertainment— the company that owned the  casino— \nwas known within the gaming industry for the sophistication of its  customer- tracking systems.

    "text": " the sophistication of its  customer- tracking systems. At the core of that system were com-puter programs much like those Andrew Pole created at Target, pre-dictive algorithms that studied gamblers’ habits and tried to ﬁ  gure \nout how to persuade them to spend more. The company assigned players a “predicted lifetime value,” and software built calendars that anticipated how often they would visit and how much they would spend. The company tracked customers through loyalty cards and mailed out coupons for free meals and cash vouchers; telemar-keters called people at home to ask where they had been. Casino employees were trained to encourage visitors to discuss their lives, in the hopes they might reveal information that could be used to predict how much they had to gamble with. One Harrah ’s executive called this approach “Pavlovian marketing.” The company ran thou-sands of tests each year to perfect their methods.\n Customer tracking \nhad increased the company’s proﬁ  ts by billions of dollars, and was \nso precise they could track a gambler’s spending to the cent and minute.\n*\nHarrah ’s, of course, was well aware that Bachmann had declared \nbankruptcy a few years earlier and had walked away from $20,000 in gambling debts. But soon after her conversation with the casino manager, she began receiving phone calls with offers of free limos that would take her to casinos in Mississippi. They offered to ﬂ  y her \nand her husband to Lake Tahoe, put them in a suite, and give them tickets to an Eagles concert. “I said my daughter has to come, and she wants to bring a friend,” Bachmann said. No problem, the com-pany replied. Everyone’s airfare and rooms were free. At the concert, \n*Harrah ’s—now known as Caesars Entertainment—disputes some of Bachmann ’s allegations. \nTheir comments can be found in the notes.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   261 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   261 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/11   12:02 PM\n262 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nshe sat in the front row.

At the core of that system were com-puter programs much like those Andrew Pole created at Target, pre-dictive algorithms that studied gamblers’ habits and tried to ﬁ  gure \nout how to persuade them to spend more. The company assigned players a “predicted lifetime value,” and software built calendars that anticipated how often they would visit and how much they would spend. The company tracked customers through loyalty cards and mailed out coupons for free meals and cash vouchers; telemar-keters called people at home to ask where they had been. Casino employees were trained to encourage visitors to discuss their lives, in the hopes they might reveal information that could be used to predict how much they had to gamble with. One Harrah ’s executive called this approach “Pavlovian marketing.” The company ran thou-sands of tests each year to perfect their methods.\n Customer tracking \nhad increased the company’s proﬁ  ts by billions of dollars, and was \nso precise they could track a gambler’s spending to the cent and minute.\n*\nHarrah ’s, of course, was well aware that Bachmann had declared \nbankruptcy a few years earlier and had walked away from $20,000 in",

    "text": " called, asking \nif she wanted a limo, entry to shows, plane tickets. Bachmann re-sisted at ﬁ  rst, but eventually she started saying yes each time an in-\nvitation arrived. When a family friend mentioned that she wanted to get married in Las Vegas, Bachmann made a phone call and the next weekend they were in the Palazzo. “Not that many people even know it exists,” she told me. “I’ve called and asked about it, and the opera-tor said it’s too exclusive to give out information over the phone. The room was like something out of a movie. It had six bedrooms and a deck and private hot tub for each one. I had a butler.”\nWhen she got to each casino, her gambling habits took over al-\nmost as soon as she walked in. She would often play for hours at a stretch. She started small at ﬁ  rst, using only the casino’s money. \nThen the numbers got larger, and she would replenish her chips with withdrawals from the ATM. It didn ’t seem to her like there was a problem. Eventually she was playing $200 to $300 per hand, two hands at a time, sometimes for a dozen hours at a time. One night, she won $60,000. Twice she walked away up $40,000. One time she went to Vegas with $100,000 in her bag and came home with noth-ing. It didn ’t really change her lifestyle. Her bank account was still so large that she never had to think about money. That’s why her parents had left her the inheritance in the ﬁ  rst place: so she could \nenjoy herself.\nShe would try to slow down, but the casino’s appeals became \nmore insistent. “One host told me that he would get ﬁ  red if I didn ’t \ncome in that weekend,” she said. “They would say, ‘We sent you to this concert and we gave you this nice room, and you haven ’t been gambling that much lately.’ Well, they did do those nice things for \nme.”\nIn 2005, her husband’s grandmother died and the family went \nback to her old hometown for the funeral. She went to the casino the \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   262 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   262 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/11   12:02 PM\nThe Neurology of Free Will ● 263\nnight before the service to clear her head and get mentally prepared \nfor all the activity the next day. Over a span of twelve hours, she lost $250,000. At the time, it was almost as if the scale of the loss didn ’t register. When she thought about it  afterward— a quarter of a million \ndollars  gone— it didn ’t seem real. She had lied to herself about so \nmuch already: that her marriage was happy when she and her hus-band sometimes went days without really speaking; that her friends were close when she knew they appeared for Vegas trips and were gone when it was over; that she was a good mom when she saw her daughters making the same mistakes she had made, getting preg-nant too early; that her parents would have been pleased to see their money thrown away this way. It felt like there were only two choices: continue lying to herself or admit that she had dishonored every-thing her mother and father had worked so hard to earn.\nA quarter of a million dollars.  She didn ’t tell her husband. “I con-\ncentrated on something new whenever that night popped into my mind,” she said.\nSoon, though, the losses were too big to ignore. Some nights, \nafter her husband was asleep, Bachmann would crawl out of bed, sit at the kitchen table, and scribble out ﬁ  gures, trying to make sense of \nhow much was gone. The depression that had started after her par-ents’ death seemed to be getting deeper. She felt so tired all the time.\nAnd Harrah ’s kept calling.“This desperation starts once you realize how much you’ve lost, \nand then you feel like you can ’t stop because you’ve got to win it back,” she said. “Sometimes I’d start feeling jumpy, like I couldn ’t think straight, and I’d know that if I pretended I might take another trip soon, it would calm me down. Then they would call and I’d say yes because it was so easy to give in. I really believed I might win it back. I’d won before. If you couldn ’t win, then gambling wouldn ’t be legal, right?”\n● ● ●\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   263",

When a family friend mentioned that she wanted to get married in Las Vegas, Bachmann made a phone call and the next weekend they were in the Palazzo. “Not that many people even know it exists,” she told me. “I’ve called and asked about it, and the opera-tor said it’s too exclusive to give out information over the phone. The room was like something out of a movie. It had six bedrooms and a deck and private hot tub for each one. I had a butler.”\nWhen she got to each casino, her gambling habits took over al-\nmost as soon as she walked in. She would often play for hours at a stretch. She started small at ﬁ  rst, using only the casino’s money. \nThen the numbers got larger, and she would replenish her chips with withdrawals from the ATM.

That’s why her parents had left her the inheritance in the ﬁ  rst place: so she could \nenjoy herself.\nShe would try to slow down, but the casino’s appeals became \nmore insistent. “One host told me that he would get ﬁ  red if I didn ’t \ncome in that weekend,” she said. “They would say, ‘We sent you to this concert and we gave you this nice room, and you haven ’t been gambling that much lately.’ Well, they did do those nice things for \nme.”\nIn 2005, her husband’s grandmother died and the family went \nback to her old hometown for the funeral.

    "text": " called, asking \nif she wanted a limo, entry to shows, plane tickets. Bachmann re-sisted at ﬁ  rst, but eventually she started saying yes each time an in-\nvitation arrived. When a family friend mentioned that she wanted to get married in Las Vegas, Bachmann made a phone call and the next weekend they were in the Palazzo. “Not that many people even know it exists,” she told me. “I’ve called and asked about it, and the opera-tor said it’s too exclusive to give out information over the phone. The room was like something out of a movie. It had six bedrooms and a deck and private hot tub for each one. I had a butler.”\nWhen she got to each casino, her gambling habits took over al-\nmost as soon as she walked in. She would often play for hours at a stretch. She started small at ﬁ  rst, using only the casino’s money. \nThen the numbers got larger, and she would replenish her chips with withdrawals from the ATM. It didn ’t seem to her like there was a problem. Eventually she was playing $200 to $300 per hand, two hands at a time, sometimes for a dozen hours at a time.",

Over a span of twelve hours, she lost $250,000. At the time, it was almost as if the scale of the loss didn ’t register. When she thought about it  afterward— a quarter of a million \ndollars  gone— it didn ’t seem real. She had lied to herself about so \nmuch already: that her marriage was happy when she and her hus-band sometimes went days without really speaking; that her friends were close when she knew they appeared for Vegas trips and were gone when it was over; that she was a good mom when she saw her daughters making the same mistakes she had made, getting preg-nant too early; that her parents would have been pleased to see their money thrown away this way. It felt like there were only two choices: continue lying to herself or admit that she had dishonored every-thing her mother and father had worked so hard to earn.\nA quarter of a million dollars.  She didn ’t tell her husband. “I con-\ncentrated on something new whenever that night popped into my mind,” she said.\nSoon, though, the losses were too big to ignore. Some nights, \nafter her husband was asleep, Bachmann would crawl out of bed, sit at the kitchen table, and scribble out ﬁ  gures, trying to make sense of \nhow much was gone. The depression that had started after her par-ents’ death seemed to be getting deeper. She felt so tired all the time.\nAnd Harrah ’s kept calling.“This desperation starts once you realize how much you’ve lost, \nand then you feel like you can ’t stop because you’ve got to win it back,” she said. “Sometimes I’d start feeling jumpy, like I couldn ’t think straight, and I’d know that if I pretended I might take another trip soon, it would calm me down. Then they would call and I’d say yes because it was so easy to give in. I really believed I might win",

Half of the participants were “pathological gamblers”—people who had lied to their families about their gam-bling, missed work to gamble, or had bounced checks at a  casino— while the other half were people who gambled socially but didn ’t exhibit any problematic behaviors. Everyone was placed on their backs inside a narrow tube and told to watch wheels of lucky 7s, apples, and gold bars spin across a video screen. The slot machine was programmed to deliver three outcomes: a win, a loss, and a “near miss,” in which the slots almost matched up but, at the last moment, failed to align. None of the participants won or lost any money. All they had to do was watch the screen as the MRI recorded their neurological activity.\n“We were particularly interested in looking at the brain systems \ninvolved in habits and addictions,” Habib told me. “What we found was that, neurologically speaking, pathological gamblers got more excited about winning. When the symbols lined up, even though they didn ’t actually win any money, the areas in their brains related to emotion and reward were much more active than in  non- pathological gamblers. \n“But what was really interesting were the near misses . To patho-\nlogical gamblers, near misses looked like wins. Their brains reacted almost the same way. But to a  nonpathological gambler, a near miss was like a loss. People without a gambling problem were better at recognizing that a near miss means you still lose.”\nTwo groups saw the exact same event, but from a neurological \nperspective, they viewed it differently. People with gambling prob-lems got a mental high from the near  misses— which, Habib hy-pothesizes, is probably why they gamble for so much longer than everyone else: because the near miss triggers those habits that prompt them to put down another bet. The  nonproblem gamblers, when they saw a near miss, got a dose of apprehension that trig-\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   264 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   264 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/11   12:02 PM\nThe Neurology of Free Will ● 265\ngered a different habit, the one that says I should quit before it gets \nworse .\nIt’s unclear if problem gamblers’ brains are different because \nthey are born that way or if sustained exposure to slot machines, online poker, and casinos can change how the brain functions. What is clear is that real neurological differences impact how pathological gamblers process  information— which helps explain why Angie Bachmann lost control every time she walked into a casino. Gaming companies are well aware of this tendency, of course, which is why in the past decades, slot machines have been reprogrammed to de-liver a more constant supply of near wins.* Gamblers who keep bet-ting after near wins are what make casinos, racetracks, and state lotteries so proﬁ  table. “ Adding a near miss to a lottery is like pouring \njet fuel on a ﬁ  re,” said a state lottery consultant who spoke to me on \nthe condition of anonymity. “You want to know why sales have ex-ploded? Every other  scratch- off ticket is designed to make you feel like you almost won.”CRAVING \nTO WINRoutine\nReward CueCRAVING \nTO WINEXITRoutine\nReward Cue\n*In the late 1990s, one of the largest slot machine manufacturers hired a former video game \nexecutive to help them design new slots. That executive’s insight was to program machines to deliver more near wins. Now, almost every slot contains numerous twists—such as free spins and sounds that erupt when icons almost align—as well as small payouts that make players feel like they are winning when, in truth, they are putting in more money than they are getting back. “No other form of gambling manipulates the human mind as beautifully as these machines,” an addictive-disorder researcher at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine told a New York \nTimes  reporter in 2004.\nDuhi_9781400069286_",

Half of the participants were “pathological gamblers”—people who had lied to their families about their gam-bling, missed work to gamble, or had bounced checks at a  casino— while the other half were people who gambled socially but didn ’t exhibit any problematic behaviors. Everyone was placed on their backs inside a narrow tube and told to watch wheels of lucky 7s, apples, and gold bars spin across a video screen. The slot machine was programmed to deliver three outcomes: a win, a loss, and a “near miss,” in which the slots almost matched up but, at the last moment, failed to align. None of the participants won or lost any money. All they had to do was watch the screen as the MRI recorded their neurological activity.\n“We were particularly interested in looking at the brain systems \ninvolved in habits and addictions,” Habib told me. “What we found was that, neurologically speaking, pathological gamblers got more excited about winning. When the symbols lined up, even though they didn ’t actually win any money, the areas in their brains related to emotion and reward were much more active than in  non- pathological gamblers. \n“But what was really interesting were the near misses . To patho-\nlogical gamblers, near misses looked like wins. Their brains reacted almost the same way. But to a  nonpathological gambler, a near miss was like a loss. People without a gambling problem were better at recognizing that a near miss means you still lose.”\nTwo groups saw the exact same event, but from a neurological \nperspective, they viewed it differently. People with gambling prob-lems got a mental high from the near  misses— which, Habib hy-pothesizes, is probably why they gamble for so much longer than everyone else: because the near",

The slot machine was programmed to deliver three outcomes: a win, a loss, and a “near miss,” in which the slots almost matched up but, at the last moment, failed to align. None of the participants won or lost any money. All they had to do was watch the screen as the MRI recorded their neurological activity.\n“We were particularly interested in looking at the brain systems \ninvolved in habits and addictions,” Habib told me. “What we found was that, neurologically speaking, pathological gamblers got more excited about winning. When the symbols lined up, even though they didn ’t actually win any money, the areas in their brains related to emotion and reward were much more active than in  non- pathological gamblers. \n“But what was really interesting were the near misses . To patho-\nlogical gamblers, near misses looked like wins. Their brains reacted almost the same way. But to a  nonpathological gambler, a near miss was like a loss. People without a gambling problem were better at recognizing that a near miss means you still lose.”\nTwo groups saw the exact same event, but from a neurological",

What is clear is that real neurological differences impact how pathological gamblers process  information— which helps explain why Angie Bachmann lost control every time she walked into a casino. Gaming companies are well aware of this tendency, of course, which is why in the past decades, slot machines have been reprogrammed to de-liver a more constant supply of near wins.* Gamblers who keep bet-ting after near wins are what make casinos, racetracks, and state lotteries so proﬁ  table. “ Adding a near miss to a lottery is like pouring \njet fuel on a ﬁ  re,” said a state lottery consultant who spoke to me on \nthe condition of anonymity. “You want to know why sales have ex-ploded?

That executive’s insight was to program machines to deliver more near wins. Now, almost every slot contains numerous twists—such as free spins and sounds that erupt when icons almost align—as well as small payouts that make players feel like they are winning when, in truth, they are putting in more money than they are getting back. “No",

    "text": " other form of gambling manipulates the human mind as beautifully as these machines,” an addictive-disorder researcher at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine told a New York \nTimes  reporter in 2004.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   265 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   265 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/11   12:02 PM\n266 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nThe areas of the brain that Habib scrutinized in his  experiment—\n the basal ganglia and the brain  stem— are the same regions where habits reside (as well as where behaviors during sleep terrors start). In the past decade, as new classes of pharmaceuticals have emerged that target that  region— such as medications for Parkinson ’s  disease— we’ve learned a great deal about how sensitive some habits can be to outside stimulation. Class action lawsuits in the United States, Australia, and Canada have been ﬁ  led against drug manufac-\nturers, alleging that pharmaceuticals caused patients to compulsively bet, eat, shop, and masturbate by targeting the circuitry involved in the habit loop. In 2008, a federal jury in Minnesota awarded a patient $8.2 million in a lawsuit against a drug company after the man claimed that his medication had caused him to gamble away more than $250,000. Hundreds of similar cases are pending.\n“In those cases, we can deﬁ  nitively say that patients have no con-\ntrol over their obsessions, because we can point to a drug that im-pacts their neurochemistry,” said Habib. “But when we look at the brains of people who are obsessive gamblers, they look very  similar— except they can ’t blame it on a medication. They tell re-searchers they don ’t want  to gamble, but they can ’t resist the crav-\nings. So why do we say that those gamblers are in control of their actions and the Parkinson ’s patients aren ’t?”\n● ● ●\nOn March 18, 2006, Angie Bachmann ﬂ  ew to a casino at Harrah ’s \ninvitation.

She had told Harrah ’s that she was al-\nmost broke, but the man on the phone said to come anyway. They would give her a line of credit, he said.\n“It felt like I couldn ’t say no, like whenever they dangled the \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   266 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   266 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/11   12:02 PM\nThe Neurology of Free Will ● 267\nsmallest temptation in front of me, my brain would shut off. I know \nthat sounds like an excuse, but they always promised it would be different this time, and I knew no matter how much I fought against it, I was eventually going to give in.”\nShe brought the last of her money with her. She started playing \n$400 a hand, two hands at a time. If she could get up a little bit, she told herself, just $100,000, she could quit and have something to give her kids. Her husband joined her for a while, but at midnight he went to bed. Around 2 \nA.M., the money she had come with was \ngone. A Harrah ’s employee gave her a promissory note to sign. Six times she signed for more cash, for a total of $125,000.\nAt about six in the morning, she hit a hot streak and her piles of \nchips began to grow. A crowd gathered. She did a quick tally: not quite enough to pay off the notes she had signed, but if she kept playing smart, she would come out on top, and then quit for good. She won ﬁ  ve times in a row. She only needed to win $20,000 more \nto pull ahead. Then the dealer hit 21. Then he hit it again. A few hands later, he hit it a third time. By ten in the morning, all her chips were gone. She asked for more credit, but the casino said no.\nBachmann left the table dazed and walked to her suite. It felt like \nthe ﬂ oor was shaking. She trailed a hand along the wall so that if she \nfell, she’d know which way to lean. When she got to the room, her husband was waiting for her.\n“It",

    "text": " other form of gambling manipulates the human mind as beautifully as these machines,” an addictive-disorder researcher at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine told a New York \nTimes  reporter in 2004.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   265 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   265 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/11   12:02 PM\n266 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nThe areas of the brain that Habib scrutinized in his  experiment—\n the basal ganglia and the brain  stem— are the same regions where habits reside (as well as where behaviors during sleep terrors start). In the past decade, as new classes of pharmaceuticals have emerged that target that  region— such as medications for Parkinson ’s  disease— we’ve learned a great deal about how sensitive some habits can be to outside stimulation. Class action lawsuits in the United States, Australia, and Canada have been ﬁ  led against drug manufac-\nturers, alleging that pharmaceuticals caused patients to compulsively bet, eat, shop, and masturbate by targeting the circuitry involved in the habit loop. In 2008, a federal jury in Minnesota awarded a patient $8.2 million in a lawsuit against a drug company after the man claimed that his medication had caused him to gamble away more than $250,000. Hundreds of similar cases are pending.\n“In those cases, we can deﬁ  nitively say that patients have no con-\ntrol over their obsessions, because we can point to a drug that im-pacts their neurochemistry,” said Habib. “But when we look at the brains of people who are obsessive gamblers, they look very  similar— except they can ’t blame it on a medication. They tell re-searchers they don ’t want  to gamble, but they can ’t resist the crav-\nings. So why do we say that those gamblers are in control of their actions and the Parkinson ’s patients aren ’t?”\n● ● ●\nOn March 18, 2006, Angie Bachmann ﬂ  ew to a casino at Harrah ’s \ninvitation.

    "text": " Class action lawsuits in the United States, Australia, and Canada have been ﬁ  led against drug manufac-\nturers, alleging that pharmaceuticals caused patients to compulsively bet, eat, shop, and masturbate by targeting the circuitry involved in the habit loop. In 2008, a federal jury in Minnesota awarded a patient $8.2 million in a lawsuit against a drug company after the man claimed that his medication had caused him to gamble away more than $250,000. Hundreds of similar cases are pending.\n“In those cases, we can deﬁ  nitively say that patients have no con-\ntrol over their obsessions, because we can point to a drug that im-pacts their neurochemistry,” said Habib. “But when we look at the brains of people who are obsessive gamblers, they look very  similar— except they can ’t blame it on a medication. They tell re-searchers they don ’t want  to gamble, but they can ’t resist the crav-\nings. So why do we say that those gamblers are in control of their actions and the Parkinson ’s patients aren ’t?”\n● ● ●\nOn March 18, 2006, Angie Bachmann �",

When she tried to calculate how much she had lost over her lifetime, she put the ﬁ  gure at about $900,000. She had told Harrah ’s that she was al-\nmost broke, but the man on the phone said to come anyway. They would give her a line of credit, he said.\n“It felt like I couldn ’t say no, like whenever they dangled the \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   266 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   266 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/11   12:02 PM\nThe Neurology of Free Will ● 267\nsmallest temptation in front of me, my brain would shut off. I know \nthat sounds like an excuse, but they always promised it would be different this time, and I knew no matter how much I fought against it, I was eventually going to give in.”\nShe brought the last of her money with her. She started playing \n$400 a hand, two hands at a time. If she could get up a little bit, she told herself, just $100,000, she could quit and have something to give her kids. Her husband joined her for a while, but at midnight he went to bed. Around 2 \nA.M., the money she had come with was \ngone. A Harrah ’s employee gave her a promissory note to sign. Six times she signed for more cash, for a total of $125,000.\nAt about six in the morning, she hit a hot streak and her piles of \nchips began to grow. A crowd gathered. She did a quick tally: not quite enough to pay off the notes she had signed, but if she kept playing smart, she would come out on top, and then quit for good. She won ﬁ  ve times in a row. She only needed to win $20,000 more \nto pull ahead. Then the dealer hit 21. Then he hit it again. A few hands later, he hit it a third time. By ten in the morning, all her chips were gone. She asked for more credit, but the casino said no.\nBachmann left the table dazed and walked to her suite.",

She started playing \n$400 a hand, two hands at a time. If she could get up a little bit, she told herself, just $100,000, she could quit and have something to give her kids. Her husband joined her for a while, but at midnight he went to bed. Around 2 \nA.M., the money she had come with was \ngone. A Harrah ’s employee gave her a promissory note to sign. Six times she signed for more cash, for a total of $125,000.\nAt about six in the morning, she hit a hot streak and her piles of \nchips began to grow. A crowd gathered. She did a quick tally: not quite enough to pay off the notes she had signed, but if she kept playing smart, she would come out on top, and then quit for good. She won ﬁ  ve times in a row. She only needed to win $20,000 more \nto pull ahead. Then the dealer hit 21. Then he hit it again.",

When she got to the room, her husband was waiting for her.\n“It’s all gone,” she told him.“Why don ’t you take a shower and go to bed?” he said. “It’s okay. \nYou’ve lost before.”\n“It’s all gone,” she said.“What do you mean?”“The money is gone,” she said. “ All of it.”“ At least we still have the house,” he said.She didn ’t tell him that she’d taken out a line of credit on their \nhome and had gambled it away.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   267 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   267 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/11   12:02 PM\n268 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nIV.\nBrian Thomas murdered his wife. Angie Bachmann squandered \nher inheritance. Is there a difference in how society should assign responsibility?\nThomas’s lawyer argued that his client wasn ’t culpable for his \nwife’s death because he acted unconsciously, automatically, his reac-tion cued by the belief that an intruder was attacking. He never chose  \nto kill, his lawyer said, and so he shouldn ’t be held responsible for her death. By the same logic,  Bachmann— as we know from Reza Habib’s research on the brains of problem  gamblers— was also driven by powerful cravings. She may have made a choice that ﬁ  rst \nday when she got dressed up and decided to spend the afternoon in a casino, and perhaps in the weeks or months that followed. But years later, by the time she was losing $250,000 in a single night, after she was so desperate to ﬁ  ght the urges that she moved to a \nstate where gambling wasn ’t legal, she was no longer making con-scious decisions. “Historically, in neuroscience, we’ve said that peo-ple with brain damage lose some of their free will,” said Habib. “But when a pathological gambler sees a casino, it seems very similar. It seems like they’re acting without choice.”\nThomas’s lawyer argued, in a manner that everyone believed, \nthat his client had made a terrible mistake and would carry the guilt of it for life. However, isn ’t it clear that Bachmann feels much the same way? “I feel so guilty, so ashamed of what I’ve done,” she told me. “I feel like I’ve let everyone down. I know that I’ll never be able to make up for this, no matter what I do.”\nThat said, there is one critical distinction between the cases of \nThomas and Bachmann: Thomas murdered an innocent person. He committed what has always been the gravest of crimes. Angie Bachmann lost money. The only victims were herself, her family, and a $27 billion company that loaned her $125,000.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   268 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   268 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/11   12:02 PM\nThe Neurology of Free Will ● 269\nThomas was set free by society and Bachmann was held account-\nable for her deeds.\nTen months after Bachmann lost everything, Harrah ’s tried to \ncollect from her bank. The promissory notes she signed bounced, and so Harrah ’s sued her, demanding Bachmann pay her debts and an additional $375,000 in  penalties— a civil punishment, in effect, for committing a crime. She countersued, claiming that by extend-ing her credit, free suites, and booze, Harrah ’s had preyed on some-one they knew had no control over her habits. Her case went all the way to the state Supreme Court. Bachmann ’s  lawyer— echoing the arguments that Thomas’s attorney had made on the murderer’s  behalf— said that she shouldn ’t be held culpable because she had been reacting automatically to temptations that Harrah ’s put in front of her. Once the offers started rolling in, he argued, once she walked into the casino, her habits took over and it was impossible for her to control her behavior.\nThe justices, acting on behalf of society, said Bachmann was \nwrong. “There is no common law duty obligating a casino operator to refrain from attempting to entice or contact gamblers that it knows or should know are compulsive gamblers,” the court wrote.

It seems like they’re acting without choice.”\nThomas’s lawyer argued, in a manner that everyone believed, \nthat his client had made a terrible mistake and would carry the guilt of it for life. However, isn ’t it clear that Bachmann feels much the same way? “I feel so guilty, so ashamed of what I’ve done,” she told me. “I feel like I’ve let everyone down. I know that I’ll never be able to make up for this, no matter what I do.”\nThat said, there is one critical distinction between the cases of \nThomas and Bachmann: Thomas murdered an innocent person. He committed what has always been the gravest of crimes. Angie Bachmann lost money. The only victims were herself, her family, and a $27 billion company that loaned her $125,000.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   268 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   268 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/11   12:02 PM\nThe Neurology of Free Will ● 269\nThomas was set free by society and Bachmann was held account-\nable for her deeds.\nTen months after Bachmann lost everything, Harrah ’s tried to \ncollect from her bank. The promissory notes she signed bounced, and so Harrah ’s sued her, demanding Bachmann pay her debts and an additional $375,000 in  penalties— a civil punishment, in effect, for committing a crime. She countersued, claiming that by extend-ing her credit, free suites, and booze, Harrah ’s had preyed on some-one they knew had no control over her habits. Her case went all the way to the state Supreme Court. Bachmann ’s  lawyer— echoing the arguments that Thomas’s attorney had made on the murderer’s  behalf— said that she shouldn ’t be held culpable because she had been reacting automatically to temptations that Harrah ’s put in front of her. Once the offers started rolling in, he argued, once she walked into the casino, her habits took over and it was impossible for her to control her behavior.\nThe justices, acting on behalf of society, said Bachmann was \nwrong. “",

    "text": "ple with brain damage lose some of their free will,” said Habib. “But when a pathological gambler sees a casino, it seems very similar. It seems like they’re acting without choice.”\nThomas’s lawyer argued, in a manner that everyone believed, \nthat his client had made a terrible mistake and would carry the guilt of it for life. However, isn ’t it clear that Bachmann feels much the same way? “I feel so guilty, so ashamed of what I’ve done,” she told me. “I feel like I’ve let everyone down. I know that I’ll never be able to make up for this, no matter what I do.”\nThat said, there is one critical distinction between the cases of \nThomas and Bachmann: Thomas murdered an innocent person. He committed what has always been the gravest of crimes. Angie Bachmann lost money. The only victims were herself, her family, and a $27 billion company that loaned her $125,000.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   268 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   268 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/",

The promissory notes she signed bounced, and so Harrah ’s sued her, demanding Bachmann pay her debts and an additional $375,000 in  penalties— a civil punishment, in effect, for committing a crime. She countersued, claiming that by extend-ing her credit, free suites, and booze, Harrah ’s had preyed on some-one they knew had no control over her habits. Her case went all the way to the state Supreme Court. Bachmann ’s  lawyer— echoing the arguments that Thomas’s attorney had made on the murderer’s  behalf— said that she shouldn ’t be held culpable because she had been reacting automatically to temptations that Harrah ’s put in front of her",

    "text": "There is no common law duty obligating a casino operator to refrain from attempting to entice or contact gamblers that it knows or should know are compulsive gamblers,” the court wrote. Indiana had a “voluntary exclusion program ” in which any person could ask for their name to be placed upon a list that required casi-nos to bar them from playing, and “the existence of the voluntary exclusion program suggests the legislature intended pathological gamblers to take personal responsibility to prevent and protect themselves against compulsive gambling,” wrote Justice Robert Rucker.\nPerhaps the difference in outcomes for Thomas and Bachmann \nis fair. After all, it’s easier to sympathize with a devastated widower than a housewife who threw everything away.\nWhy  is it easier, though? Why does it seem the bereaved husband \nis a victim, while the bankrupt gambler got her just deserts? Why do \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   269 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   269 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/11   12:02 PM\n270 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nsome habits seem like they should be so easy to control, while oth-\ners seem out of reach?\nMore important, is it right to make a distinction in the ﬁ  rst place?\n“Some thinkers,” Aristotle wrote in Nicomachean Ethics,  “hold \nthat it is by nature that people become good, others that it is by habit, and others that it is by instruction.” For Aristotle, habits reigned supreme. The behaviors that occur unthinkingly are the evidence of our truest selves, he said. So “just as a piece of land has to be prepared beforehand if it is to nourish the seed, so the mind of the pupil has to be prepared in its habits if it is to enjoy and dislike the right things.”\nHabits are not as simple as they appear. As I’ve tried to demon-\nstrate throughout this book,  habits— even once they are rooted in our  minds— aren ’t destiny. We can choose our habits, once we know how. Everything we know about habits, from neurologists studying amnesiacs and organizational experts remaking companies, is that any of them can be changed, if you understand how they function.\nHundreds of habits inﬂ  uence our  days— they guide how we get \ndressed in the morning, talk to our kids, and fall asleep at night; they impact what we eat for lunch, how we do business, and whether we exercise or have a beer after work. Each of them has a different cue and offers a unique reward. Some are simple and others are complex, drawing upon emotional triggers and offering subtle neu-rochemical prizes. But every habit, no matter its complexity, is mal-leable. The most addicted alcoholics can become sober. The most dysfunctional companies can transform themselves. A high school dropout can become a successful manager.\nHowever, to modify a habit, you must decide to change it. You \nmust consciously accept the hard work of identifying the cues and rewards that drive the habits’ routines, and ﬁ  nd alternatives. You \nmust know you have control and be  self- conscious enough to use  it— and every chapter in this book is devoted to illustrating a differ-ent aspect of why that control is real.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   270 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   270 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/11   12:02 PM\nThe Neurology of Free Will ● 271\nSo though both Angie Bachmann and Brian Thomas made varia-\ntions on the same  claim— that they acted out of habit, that they had no control over their actions because those behaviors unfolded  automatically— it seems fair that they should be treated differently. It is just that Angie Bachmann should be held accountable and that Brian Thomas should go free because Thomas never knew the pat-terns that drove him to kill existed in the ﬁ  rst  place— much less that \nhe could master them. Bachmann, on the other hand, was aware of her habits. And once you know a habit exists, you have the respon-sibility to change it. If she had tried a bit harder, perhaps she could have reined them in. Others have done so, even in the face of greater temptations.\nThat, in some ways, is the point of this book. Perhaps a sleep-\nwalking murderer can plausibly argue he wasn ’t aware of his habit, and so he doesn ’t bear responsibility for his crime. But almost all the other patterns that exist in most people’s  lives— how we eat",

Indiana had a “voluntary exclusion program ” in which any person could ask for their name to be placed upon a list that required casi-nos to bar them from playing, and “the existence of the voluntary exclusion program suggests the legislature intended pathological gamblers to take personal responsibility to prevent and protect themselves against compulsive gambling,” wrote Justice Robert Rucker.\nPerhaps the difference in outcomes for Thomas and Bachmann \nis fair. After all, it’s easier to sympathize with a devastated widower than a housewife who threw everything away.\nWhy  is it easier, though? Why does it seem the bereaved husband \nis a victim, while the bankrupt gambler got her just deserts?

The behaviors that occur unthinkingly are the evidence of our truest selves, he said. So “just as a piece of land has to be prepared beforehand if it is to nourish the seed, so the mind of the pupil has to be prepared in its habits if it is to enjoy and dislike the right things.”\nHabits are not as simple as they appear. As I’ve tried to demon-\nstrate throughout this book,  habits— even once they are rooted in our  minds— aren ’t destiny. We can choose our habits, once we know how. Everything we know about habits, from neurologists studying amnesiacs and organizational experts remaking companies, is that any of them can be changed, if you understand how they function.\nHundreds of habits inﬂ  uence our ",

The behaviors that occur unthinkingly are the evidence of our truest selves, he said. So “just as a piece of land has to be prepared beforehand if it is to nourish the seed, so the mind of the pupil has to be prepared in its habits if it is to enjoy and dislike the right things.”\nHabits are not as simple as they appear. As I’ve tried to demon-\nstrate throughout this book,  habits— even once they are rooted in our  minds— aren ’t destiny. We can choose our habits, once we know how.",

    "text": " Everything we know about habits, from neurologists studying amnesiacs and organizational experts remaking companies, is that any of them can be changed, if you understand how they function.\nHundreds of habits inﬂ  uence our  days— they guide how we get \ndressed in the morning, talk to our kids, and fall asleep at night; they impact what we eat for lunch, how we do business, and whether we exercise or have a beer after work. Each of them has a different cue and offers a unique reward. Some are simple and others are complex, drawing upon emotional triggers and offering subtle neu-rochemical prizes. But every habit, no matter its complexity, is mal-leable. The most addicted alcoholics can become sober. The most dysfunctional companies can transform themselves. A high school dropout can become a successful manager.\nHowever, to modify a habit, you must decide to change it. You \nmust consciously accept the hard work of identifying the cues and rewards that drive the habits’ routines, and ﬁ  nd alternatives. You \nmust know you have control and be  self- conscious enough to use  it— and every chapter in this book is devoted to illustrating a differ-ent aspect of why that control is real.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   270 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   270 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/11   12:02 PM\nThe Neurology of Free Will ● 271\nSo though both Angie Bachmann and Brian Thomas made varia-\ntions on the same  claim— that they acted out of habit, that they had no control over their actions because those behaviors unfolded  automatically— it seems fair that they should be treated differently. It is just that Angie Bachmann should be held accountable and that Brian Thomas should go free because Thomas never knew the pat-terns that drove him to kill existed in the ﬁ  rst  place— much less that \nhe could master them. Bachmann, on the other hand, was aware of her habits. And once you know a habit exists, you have the respon-sibility to change it. If she had tried a bit harder, perhaps she could have reined them in. Others have done so, even in the face of greater temptations.\nThat, in some ways, is the point of this book.",

    "text": " Everything we know about habits, from neurologists studying amnesiacs and organizational experts remaking companies, is that any of them can be changed, if you understand how they function.\nHundreds of habits inﬂ  uence our  days— they guide how we get \ndressed in the morning, talk to our kids, and fall asleep at night; they impact what we eat for lunch, how we do business, and whether we exercise or have a beer after work. Each of them has a different cue and offers a unique reward. Some are simple and others are complex, drawing upon emotional triggers and offering subtle neu-rochemical prizes. But every habit, no matter its complexity, is mal-leable. The most addicted alcoholics can become sober. The most dysfunctional companies can transform themselves. A high school dropout can become a successful manager.\nHowever, to modify a habit, you must decide to change it. You \nmust consciously accept the hard work of identifying the cues and rewards that drive the habits’ routines, and ﬁ  nd alternatives. You \nmust know you have control and be  self- conscious enough to use  it— and every chapter in this book is devoted to illustrating a differ-ent aspect of why that control is real.\n",

    "text": " Perhaps a sleep-\nwalking murderer can plausibly argue he wasn ’t aware of his habit, and so he doesn ’t bear responsibility for his crime. But almost all the other patterns that exist in most people’s  lives— how we eat and sleep and talk to our kids, how we unthinkingly spend our time, at-tention, and  money— those are habits that we know exist. And once \nyou understand that habits can change, you have the  freedom— and the  responsibility— to remake them. Once you understand that hab-its can be rebuilt, the power of habit becomes easier to grasp, and the only option left is to get to work.\n● ● ●\n“ All our life,” William James told us in the prologue, “so far as it has deﬁ nite form, is but a mass of  habits— practical, emotional, and \n intellectual— systematically organized for our weal or woe, and bearing us irresistibly toward our destiny, whatever the latter may be.”\nJames, who died in 1910, hailed from an accomplished family. \nHis father was a wealthy and prominent theologian. His brother, Henry, was a brilliant, successful writer whose novels are still stud-\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   271 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   271 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/11   12:02 PM\n272 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nied today. William, into his thirties, was the unaccomplished one in \nthe family. He was sick as a child. He wanted to become a painter, and then enrolled in medical school, then left to join an expedition up the Amazon River. Then he quit that, as well. He chastised him-self in his diary for not being good  at anything. What’s more, he \nwasn ’t certain if he could get better. In medical school, he had vis-ited a hospital for the insane and had seen a man hurling himself against a wall. The patient, a doctor explained, suffered from hallu-cinations. James didn ’t say that he often felt like he shared more in common with the patients than his fellow physicians.  \n“Today I about touched bottom, and perceive plainly that I must \nface the choice with open eyes,” James wrote in his diary in 1870, when he was  twenty- eight years old. “Shall I frankly throw the moral business overboard, as one unsuited to my innate aptitudes?”\nIs suicide, in other words, a better choice?Two months later, James made a decision. Before doing anything \nrash, he would conduct a yearlong experiment. He would spend twelve months believing that he had control over himself and his destiny, that he could become better, that he had the free will to change. There was no proof that it was true. But he would free him-self to believe,  all evidence to the contrary, that change was possible. \n“I think that yesterday was a crisis in my life,” he wrote in his diary. Regarding his ability to change, “I will assume for the  present— until next  year— that it is no illusion. My ﬁ  rst act of free will shall be to \nbelieve in free will.”\nOver the next year, he practiced every day. In his diary, he wrote \nas if his control over himself and his choices was never in question. He got married. He started teaching at Harvard. He began spending time with Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., who would go on to become a Supreme Court justice, and Charles Sanders Peirce, a pioneer in the study of semiotics, in a discussion group they called the Meta-physical Club. Two years after writing his diary entry, James sent a letter to the philosopher Charles Renouvier, who had expounded at \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   272 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   272 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/11   12:02 PM\nThe Neurology of Free Will ● 273\nlength on free will. “I must not lose this opportunity of telling you \nof the admiration and gratitude which have been excited in me by the reading of your Essais ,” James wrote. “Thanks to you I possess \nfor the ﬁ  rst time an intelligible and reasonable conception of free-\ndom. . . . I can say that through that philosophy I am beginning to experience a rebirth of the moral life; and I can assure you, sir, that this is no small thing.”\nLater, he would famously write that the will to believe  is the most \nimportant",

But almost all the other patterns that exist in most people’s  lives— how we eat and sleep and talk to our kids, how we unthinkingly spend our time, at-tention, and  money— those are habits that we know exist. And once \nyou understand that habits can change, you have the  freedom— and the  responsibility— to remake them. Once you understand that hab-its can be rebuilt, the power of habit becomes easier to grasp, and the only option left is to get to work.\n● ● ●\n“ All our life,” William James told us in the prologue, “so far as it has deﬁ nite form, is but a mass of  habits— practical, emotional, and \n intellectual— systematically organized for our weal or woe, and bearing us irresistibly toward our destiny, whatever the latter may be.”\nJames, who died in 1910, hailed from an accomplished family. \nHis father was a wealthy and prominent theologian.

William, into his thirties, was the unaccomplished one in \nthe family. He was sick as a child. He wanted to become a painter, and then enrolled in medical school, then left to join an expedition up the Amazon River. Then he quit that, as well. He chastised him-self in his diary for not being good  at anything. What’s more, he \nwasn ’t certain if he could get better. In medical school, he had vis-ited a hospital for the insane and had seen a man hurling himself against a wall. The patient, a doctor explained, suffered from hallu-cinations. James didn ’t say that he often felt like he shared more in common with the patients than his fellow physicians.  \n“Today I about touched bottom, and perceive plainly that I must \nface the choice with open eyes,” James wrote in",

James didn ’t say that he often felt like he shared more in common with the patients than his fellow physicians.  \n“Today I about touched bottom, and perceive plainly that I must \nface the choice with open eyes,” James wrote in his diary in 1870, when he was  twenty- eight years old. “Shall I frankly throw the moral business overboard, as one unsuited to my innate aptitudes?”\nIs suicide, in other words, a better choice?Two months later, James made a decision. Before doing anything \nrash, he would conduct a yearlong experiment. He would spend twelve months believing that he had control over himself and his destiny, that he could become better, that he had the free will to change. There was no proof that it was true. But he would free him-self to believe,  all evidence to the contrary, that change was possible. \n“I think that yesterday was a crisis in my life,” he wrote in his diary. Regarding his ability to change, “I will assume for the  present— until next  year— that it is no illusion. My ﬁ  rst act of free will shall be to \nbelieve in free will.”\nOver the next year, he practiced every day. In his diary, he wrote \nas if his control over himself and his choices was never in question. He got married. He started teaching at Harvard. He began spending time with Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., who would go on to become a Supreme Court justice, and Charles Sanders Peirce, a pioneer in the study of semiotics, in a discussion group they called the Meta-physical Club. Two years after writing his diary entry, James sent a letter to the philosopher Charles Renouvier, who had expounded at \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   272 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   272 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/11   12:02 PM\nThe Neurology of Free Will ● 273\nlength on free will. “I must not lose this opportunity of telling you \nof the admiration and gratitude which have been excited in me by the reading of your Essais ,” James wrote. “Thanks to you I possess \nfor the ﬁ  rst time an intelligible and reasonable conception of free-\ndom. . . .

    "text": " say that through that philosophy I am beginning to experience a rebirth of the moral life; and I can assure you, sir, that this is no small thing.”\nLater, he would famously write that the will to believe  is the most \nimportant ingredient in creating belief in change. And one of the most important methods for creating that belief, he argued, was habits. Habits, he noted, are what allow us to “do a thing with difﬁ  -\nculty the ﬁ  rst time, but soon do it more and more easily, and ﬁ  nally, \nwith sufﬁ  cient practice, do it  semi- mechanically, or with hardly any \nconsciousness at all.” Once we choose who we want to be, people grow “to the way in which they have been exercised, just as a sheet of paper or a coat, once creased or folded, tends to fall forever after-ward into the same identical folds.”\nIf you believe you can  change— if you make it  a habit— the \nchange becomes real. This is the real power of habit: the insight that your habits are what you choose them to be. Once that choice  occurs— and becomes automatic,  habitual— it’s not only real, it starts to seem inevitable, the thing, as James wrote, that bears “us irresistibly toward our destiny, whatever the latter may be.”\nThe way we habitually think of our surroundings and ourselves \ncreate the worlds that each of us inhabit. “There are these two young ﬁ sh swimming along and they happen to meet an older ﬁ  sh swim-\nming the other way, who nods at them and says ‘Morning, boys. How’s the water?’” the writer David Foster Wallace told a class of graduating college students in 2005. “ And the two young ﬁ  sh swim \non for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes ‘What the hell is water?’”\nThe water—the habits and patterns—is the unthinking choices \nand invisible decisions that surround us every  day. And which, just \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   273 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   273 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/11   12:02 PM\n274 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nby looking for them, become visible again. And once it is visible, it’s \nwithin our control.\nThroughout his life, William James wrote about habits and their \ncentral role in creating happiness and success. He eventually de-voted an entire chapter in his masterpiece  The Principles of Psychol-\nogy to the topic. Water, he said, is the most apt analogy for how a \nhabit works. Water “hollows out for itself a channel, which grows broader and deeper; and, after having ceased to ﬂ  ow, it resumes, \nwhen it ﬂ  ows again, the path traced by itself before.”\nYou now know how to redirect that path. You now have the power \nto swim.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   274 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   274 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/11   12:02 PM",

And one of the most important methods for creating that belief, he argued, was habits. Habits, he noted, are what allow us to “do a thing with difﬁ  -\nculty the ﬁ  rst time, but soon do it more and more easily, and ﬁ  nally, \nwith sufﬁ  cient practice, do it  semi- mechanically, or with hardly any \nconsciousness at all.” Once we choose who we want to be, people grow “to the way in which they have been exercised, just as a sheet of paper or a coat, once creased or folded, tends to fall forever after-ward into the same identical folds.”\nIf you believe you can  change— if you make it  a habit— the \nchange becomes real. This is the real power of habit: the insight that your habits are what you choose them to be. Once that choice  occurs— and becomes automatic,  habitual— it’s not only real, it starts to seem inevitable, the thing, as James wrote, that bears “us irresistibly toward our destiny, whatever the latter may be.”\nThe way we habitually think of our surroundings and ourselves \ncreate the worlds that each of us inhabit. “There are these two young ﬁ sh swimming along and they happen to meet an older ﬁ  sh swim-\nming the other way, who nods at them and says ‘Morning, boys. How’s the water?’” the writer David Foster Wallace told a class of graduating college students in 2005. “ And the two young ﬁ  sh swim \non for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes ‘What the hell is water?’”\nThe water—the habits and patterns—is the unthinking choices \nand invisible decisions that surround us every  day.

And once it is visible, it’s \nwithin our control.\nThroughout his life, William James wrote about habits and their \ncentral role in creating happiness and success. He eventually de-voted an entire chapter in his masterpiece  The Principles of Psychol-\nogy to the topic. Water, he said, is the most apt analogy for how a \nhabit works. Water “hollows out for itself a channel, which grows broader and deeper; and, after having ceased to ﬂ  ow, it resumes, \nwhen it ﬂ  ows again, the path traced by itself before.”\nYou now know how to redirect that path. You now have the power \nto swim.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   274 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   274 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/11   12:02 PM",

And once it is visible, it’s \nwithin our control.\nThroughout his life, William James wrote about habits and their \ncentral role in creating happiness and success. He eventually de-voted an entire chapter in his masterpiece  The Principles of Psychol-\nogy to the topic. Water, he said, is the most apt analogy for how a \nhabit works. Water “hollows out for itself a channel, which grows broader and deeper; and, after having ceased to ﬂ  ow, it resumes, \nwhen it ﬂ  ows again, the path traced by itself before.”\nYou now know how to redirect that path. You now have the power \nto swim.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   274 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   274 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/",
