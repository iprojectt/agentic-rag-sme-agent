I envision a world in w hich no meet- \ning or discussion will end, and no interaction ceas e, without a \nclear determination of whether or not some action i s needed窶能nand if it is, what it will be, or at least who has responsibility for it. \nI envision organizations adopting a standard that a nything that \nlands in anyone's \"ten acres\" will be evaluated for  action required, \nand the resulting decisions managed appropriately. Imagine the \nfreedom that would allow to focus attention on bigg er issues and \nopportunities. \nOver the years I have noticed an extraordinary \nshift in energy and productivity whenever individu-\nals and groups installed \"What's the next action?\" as \na fundamental and consistently asked question. As \nsimple as the query seems, it is still somewhat rar e to \nfind it fully operational where it needs to be. \nOne   of  the   greatest   challenges   you   may \nencounter is that once you have gotten used to \n\"What's the next action?\" for yourself and those \naround you, interacting with people who aren't ask-\ning it can be highly frustrating. It clarifies thin gs so \nquickly that dealing with people and environments t hat don't use \nit can seem nightmarish. \nWe are all accountable to define what, if anything,  we are \ncommitted to make happen as we engage with ourselve s and \n236 When a culture \nadopts \"What's the \nnext action?\" as a \nstandard operating \nquery, there's an \nautomatic increase \nin energy, \nproductivity, clarity, \nand focus. \nCHAPTER 12  |  THE POWER OF THE NEXT-ACTION DECISION \nothers. And at some point, for any outcome that we have an inter- \nnal commitment to complete, we must make the decisi on about \nthe next physical action required. There's a great difference, how- \never, between making that decision when things show  up and \ndoing it when they blow up. \nThe Source of the Technique \nI learned this simple but extraordinary next-action  technique \ntwenty years ago from a longtime friend and managem ent- \nconsulting mentor of mine, Dean Acheson (no relatio n to the \nformer secretary of state). Dean had spent many pri or years con- \nsulting with executives and researching what was re quired to free \nthe psychic logjams of many of them about projects and situations \nthey were involved in. One day he just started pick ing up each \nindividual piece of paper on an executive's desk an d forcing him to \ndecide what the very next thing was that he had to do to move it \nforward. The results were so immediate and so profo und for the \nexecutive that Dean continued for years to perfect a methodology \nusing that same question to process the in-basket. Since then \nboth of us have trained and coached thousands of pe ople with this \nkey concept, and it remains a foolproof technique. It never fails to \ngreatly improve both the productivity and the peace  of mind of \nthe user to determine what the next physical action  is that will \nmove something forward. \nCreating the Option of Doing \nHow could something so simple be so powerful窶能"What' s the \nnext action?\" \nTo help answer that question, I invite you to revis it for a \nmoment your mind-sweep list (see page 113). Or at l east to think \nabout all the projects that are probably sitting ar ound in your \n237 \n238 THE POWER OF THE KEY PRINCIPLES I  PART THREE \npsyche. Do you have a sense that they haven't been moving along \nas consistently and productively as they could be? You'll probably \nadmit that yes, indeed, a few have been a little bi t \"stuck.\" \nIf you haven't known for sure whether you needed to  make a \ncall, send an e-mail, look up something, or buy an item at the \nstore as the very next thing to move on, it hasn't been getting \ndone. What's ironic is that it would likely require  only about ten \nseconds of thinking to figure out what the next act ion would be \nfor almost everything on your list. But it's ten se conds of thinking \nthat most people haven't done about most things on their list. \nFor example, a client will have something like \"tir es\" on a \nlist. \nI then ask, \"What's that about?\" \nHe responds, \"Well, I need new tires on my car.\" \n\"So what's the next action?\" \nAt that point the client usually wrinkles up his fo rehead, \nponders for a few moments, and",

I envision a world in w hich no meet- \ning or discussion will end, and no interaction ceas e, without a \nclear determination of whether or not some action i s needed窶能nand if it is, what it will be, or at least who has responsibility for it. \nI envision organizations adopting a standard that a nything that \nlands in anyone's \"ten acres\" will be evaluated for  action required, \nand the resulting decisions managed appropriately. Imagine the \nfreedom that would allow to focus attention on bigg er issues and \nopportunities. \nOver the years I have noticed an extraordinary \nshift in energy and productivity whenever individu-\nals and groups installed \"What's the next action?\" as \na fundamental and consistently asked question. As \nsimple as the query seems, it is still somewhat rar e to \nfind it fully operational where it needs to be. \nOne   of  the   greatest   challenges   you   may \nencounter is that once you have gotten used to \n\"What's the next action?\" for yourself and those \naround you, interacting with people who aren't ask-\ning it can be highly frustrating. It clarifies thin gs so \nquickly that dealing with people and environments t hat don't use \nit can seem nightmarish. \nWe are all accountable to define what, if anything,  we are \ncommitted to make happen as we engage with ourselve s and \n236 When a culture \nadopts \"What's the \nnext action?\" as a \nstandard operating \nquery, there's an \nautomatic increase \nin energy, \nproductivity, clarity, \nand focus. \nCHAPTER 12  |  THE POWER OF THE NEXT-ACTION DECISION \nothers. And at some point, for any outcome that we have an inter- \nnal commitment to complete, we must make the decisi on about \nthe next physical action required. There's a great difference, how- \never, between making that decision when things show  up and \ndoing it when they blow up. \nThe Source of the Technique \nI learned this simple but extraordinary next-action  technique \ntwenty years ago from a longtime friend and managem ent- \nconsulting mentor of mine, Dean Acheson (no relatio n to the \nformer secretary of state).

I envision a world in w hich no meet- \ning or discussion will end, and no interaction ceas e, without a \nclear determination of whether or not some action i s needed窶能nand if it is, what it will be, or at least who has responsibility for it. \nI envision organizations adopting a standard that a nything that \nlands in anyone's \"ten acres\" will be evaluated for  action required, \nand the resulting decisions managed appropriately. Imagine the \nfreedom that would allow to focus attention on bigg er issues and \nopportunities. \nOver the years I have noticed an extraordinary \nshift in energy and productivity whenever individu-\nals and groups installed \"What's the next action?\" as \na fundamental and consistently asked question. As \nsimple as the query seems, it is still somewhat rar e to \nfind it fully operational where it needs to be. \nOne   of  the   greatest   challenges   you   may \nencounter is that once you have gotten used to \n\"What's the next action?\" for yourself and those \naround you,",

    "text": "I learned this simple but extraordinary next-action  technique \ntwenty years ago from a longtime friend and managem ent- \nconsulting mentor of mine, Dean Acheson (no relatio n to the \nformer secretary of state). Dean had spent many pri or years con- \nsulting with executives and researching what was re quired to free \nthe psychic logjams of many of them about projects and situations \nthey were involved in. One day he just started pick ing up each \nindividual piece of paper on an executive's desk an d forcing him to \ndecide what the very next thing was that he had to do to move it \nforward. The results were so immediate and so profo und for the \nexecutive that Dean continued for years to perfect a methodology \nusing that same question to process the in-basket. Since then \nboth of us have trained and coached thousands of pe ople with this \nkey concept, and it remains a foolproof technique. It never fails to \ngreatly improve both the productivity and the peace  of mind of \nthe user to determine what the next physical action  is that will \nmove something forward. \nCreating the Option of Doing \nHow could something so simple be so powerful窶能"What' s the \nnext action?\" \nTo help answer that question, I invite you to revis it for a \nmoment your mind-sweep list (see page 113). Or at l east to think \nabout all the projects that are probably sitting ar ound in your \n237 \n238 THE POWER OF THE KEY PRINCIPLES I  PART THREE \npsyche. Do you have a sense that they haven't been moving along \nas consistently and productively as they could be? You'll probably \nadmit that yes, indeed, a few have been a little bi t \"stuck.\" \nIf you haven't known for sure whether you needed to  make a \ncall, send an e-mail, look up something, or buy an item at the \nstore as the very next thing to move on, it hasn't been getting \ndone. What's ironic is that it would likely require  only about ten \nseconds of thinking to figure out what the next act ion would be \nfor almost everything on your list. But it's ten se conds of thinking \nthat most people haven't done about most things on their list. \nFor example, a client will have something like \"tir es\" on a \nlist. \nI then ask, \"What",

Dean had spent many pri or years con- \nsulting with executives and researching what was re quired to free \nthe psychic logjams of many of them about projects and situations \nthey were involved in. One day he just started pick ing up each \nindividual piece of paper on an executive's desk an d forcing him to \ndecide what the very next thing was that he had to do to move it \nforward. The results were so immediate and so profo und for the \nexecutive that Dean continued for years to perfect a methodology \nusing that same question to process the in-basket. Since then \nboth of us have trained and coached thousands of pe ople with this \nkey concept, and it remains a foolproof technique. It never fails to \ngreatly improve both the productivity and the peace  of mind of \nthe user to determine what the next physical action  is that will \nmove something forward. \nCreating the Option of Doing \nHow could something so simple be so powerful窶能"What' s the",

    "text": "'s that about?\" \nHe responds, \"Well, I need new tires on my car.\" \n\"So what's the next action?\" \nAt that point the client usually wrinkles up his fo rehead, \nponders for a few moments, and expresses his conclu sion: \"Well, I \nneed to call a tire store and get some prices.\" \nThat's about how much time is required to decide wh at the \n\"doing\" would look like on almost everything. It's just the few sec- \nonds of focused thinking that most people have not yet done \nabout most of their stuff. \nIt will probably be true, too, that the person who needs tires \non his car has had that on his radar for quite a wh ile. It's also likely \nthat he's been at a phone hundreds of times, often with enough \ntime and/or energy only to make just such a call. W hy didn't he \nmake it? Because in that state of mind, the last th ing in the world \nhe felt like doing was considering all his projects , including get- \nting tires, and what their next actions were. In th ose moments he \ndidn't feel like thinking at all. \nWhat he needed was to have already figured those th ings \nout. If he gets that next-action thinking done, the n, when he hap- \npens to have fifteen minutes before a meeting, with  a phone at \nhand, and his energy at about 4.2 out of 10, he can  look at the list \nof options of things to do and be delighted to see \"Call tire store \nCHAPTER 12  | THE POWER OF THE NEXT-ACTION DECISION \nfor prices\" on it. \"That's something I can do and c om- \nplete successfully!\" he'll think, and then he'll ac tually be \nmotivated to make the call, just to experience the \"win\" \nof completing something useful in the time and ener gy \nwindow he's in. In this context he'd be incapable o f \nstarting a large proposal draft for a client, but h e has \nsufficient resources for punching phone numbers and\ngetting simple information quickly. It's highly pro bable \nthat at some point soon he'll look at the new set o f tires \non his car and feel on top of the world. \nDefining what real doing looks like, on the most \nbasic level, and organizing placeholder reminders \nthat we can trust, are master keys to productivity \nenhancement. \nThese are learnable techniques, and ones that we ca n con- \ntinue to get better at. \nOften even the simplest things are stuck because we  haven't \nmade a final decision yet about the next action. Pe ople in my \nseminars often have things on their lists like \"Get  a tune-up for \nthe car.\" Is \"Get a tune-up\" a next action? Not unl ess you're walk- \ning out with wrench in hand, dressed for grease. \n\"So, what's the next action?\" \n\"Uh, I need to take the car to the garage. Oh, yeah , I need to \nfind out if the garage can take it. I guess I need to call the garage \nand make the appointment.\" \n\"Do you have the number?\" \n\"Darn, no ... I don't have the number for the garag e. Fred \nrecommended that garage to me, and I don't have \nthe number. I knew something was missing in the \nequation.\" \nAnd that's often what happens with so many \nthings for so many people. We glance at the project , \nand some part of us thinks, \"I don't quite have all  the \npieces between here and there.\" We know something i s \nmissing, but we're not sure what it is exactly, so we quit. \n239 The secret of \ngetting ahead is \ngetting started. \nThe secret of \ngetting started is \nbreaking your \ncomplex \noverwhelm ing \ntasks into small \nmanageable tasks, \nand then starting \non the first one. \n窶熱ark Twain \nWithout a next\naction, there \nremains a \npotentially infinite \ngap between current\nreality and what you \nneed to do.\nTHE POWER OF THE KEY PRINCIPLES  |  PART THREE \n\"So, what's the next action?\" \n\"I need to get the number. I guess I could get it f rom Fred.\" \n\"Do you have Fred's number?\" \n\"I have Fred's number!\" \nSo the next action really is \"Call Fred for the num ber of the \ngarage.\" \nDid you notice how many steps had to be tracked bac k \nbefore we actually got to the real next action on t his project? \nThat's typical. Most people have many things just l ike that on \ntheir lists. \nWhy Bright People Procrastinate the",

It's just the few sec- \nonds of focused thinking that most people have not yet done \nabout most of their stuff. \nIt will probably be true, too, that the person who needs tires \non his car has had that on his radar for quite a wh ile. It's also likely \nthat he's been at a phone hundreds of times, often with enough \ntime and/or energy only to make just such a call. W hy didn't he \nmake it? Because in that state of mind, the last th ing in the world \nhe felt like doing was considering all his projects , including get- \nting tires, and what their next actions were. In th ose moments he \ndidn't feel like thinking at all. \nWhat he needed was to have already figured those th ings \nout. If he gets that next-action thinking done, the n, when he hap- \npens to have fifteen minutes before a meeting, with  a phone at \nhand, and his energy at about 4.2 out of 10, he can  look at the list \nof options of things to do and be delighted to see \"Call tire store \nCHAPTER 12  | THE POWER OF THE NEXT-ACTION DECISION \nfor prices\" on it. \"That's something I can do and c om- \nplete successfully!\" he'll think, and then he'll ac tually be \nmotivated to make the call, just to experience the \"win\" \nof completing something useful in the time and ener gy \nwindow he's in. In this context he'd be incapable o f \nstarting a large proposal draft for a client, but h e has \nsufficient resources for punching phone numbers and\ngetting simple information quickly. It's highly pro bable \nthat at some point soon he'll look at the new set o f tires \non his car and feel on top of the world. \nDefining what real doing looks like, on the most \nbasic level, and organizing placeholder reminders \n",

Pe ople in my \nseminars often have things on their lists like \"Get  a tune-up for \nthe car.\" Is \"Get a tune-up\" a next action? Not unl ess you're walk- \ning out with wrench in hand, dressed for grease. \n\"So, what's the next action?\" \n\"Uh, I need to take the car to the garage. Oh, yeah , I need to \nfind out if the garage can take it. I guess I need to call the garage \nand make the appointment.\" \n\"Do you have the number?\" \n\"Darn, no ... I don't have the number for the garag e. Fred \nrecommended that garage to me, and I don't have \nthe number. I knew something was missing in the \nequation.\" \nAnd that's often what happens with so many \nthings for so many people. We glance at the project , \nand some part of us thinks, \"I don't quite have all  the \npieces between here and there.\" We know something i s \nmissing, but we're not sure what it is exactly, so we quit. \n239 The secret of \ngetting ahead is \ngetting started. \nThe secret of \ngetting started is \nbreaking your \ncomplex \noverwhelm ing \ntasks into small \nmanageable tasks, \nand then starting \non the first one. \n窶熱ark Twain \nWithout a next\naction, there \nremains a \npotentially infinite \ngap between current\nreality and what you \nneed to do.\nTHE POWER OF THE KEY PRINCIPLES  |  PART THREE \n\"So, what's the next action?\" \n\"I need to get the number. I guess I could get it f rom Fred.\" \n\"Do you have Fred's number?\" \n\"I have Fred's number!\" \nSo the next action really is \"Call Fred for the num ber of the \ngarage.\" \nDid you notice how many",

    "text": " steps had to be tracked bac k \nbefore we actually got to the real next action on t his project? \nThat's typical. Most people have many things just l ike that on \ntheir lists. \nWhy Bright People Procrastinate the Most \nIt's really the smartest people who have the highes t number of \nundecided things in their lives and on their lists.  Why is that? \nThink of how our bodies respond to the images we ho ld in our \nminds. It appears that the nervous system can't tel l the difference \nbetween a well-imagined thought and reality. \nTo prove this to yourself, picture yourself walking  into a \nsupermarket and going over to the brightly lit frui t-and-vegetable \nsection. Are you there? OK, now go to the citrus bi ns窶俳ranges, \ngrapefruits, lemons. Now see the big pile of yellow  lemons. \nThere's a cutting board and a knife next to them. T ake one of \nthose big yellow lemons and cut it in half. Smell t hat citrus smell! \nIt's really juicy, and there's lemon juice tricklin g onto \nthe board. Now take a half lemon and cut that in half, \nso you have a quarter lemon wedge in your hands. \nOK, now窶排emember how you did this as a kid?窶能nput that quarter of a lemon in your mouth and bite \ninto it! Scrunch! \nIf you played along with me, you probably \nnoticed that  the  saliva  content  in your  mouth \nincreased at least a bit. Your body was actually tr ying to process \ncitric acid! And it was just in your mind. \n240 Bright people have \nthe capability of \nfreaking out faster \nand more \ndramatically than \nanyone else. \nCHAPTER 12  I THE POWER OF THE NEXT-ACTION DECISION \nIf your body responds to the pictures you give it, how are you \nlikely to feel physically when you think about, say , doing your \ntaxes? Are you sending yourself \"easy,\" \"let's go,\"  completion, suc- \ncess, and \"I'm a winner!\" pictures? Probably not. F or just that rea- \nson, what kinds of people would logically be the mo st resistant to \nbeing reminded about a project like that窶杯hat is, w ho would pro- \ncrastinate the most? Of course, it would be the mos t creative, \nsensitive, and intelligent people! Because their se nsi- \ntivity gives them the capability of producing in th eir \nminds lurid nightmare scenarios about what might \nbe involved in doing the project, and all the negat ive \nconsequences that might occur if it weren't done pe r- \nfectly! They just freak out in an instant and quit!\nWho doesn't procrastinate? Often it's the insen- \nsitive oafs who just take something and start plod-\nding forward, unaware of all the things that could go \nwrong. Everyone else tends to get hung up about all\nkinds of things. \nDo my taxes? Oh, no! It's not going to be that easy . It's going \nto be different this year, I'm sure. I saw the form s窶杯hey look dif- \nferent. There are probably new rules I'm going to h ave to figure \nout. I might have to read all that damn material. L ong form, short \nform, medium form? File together, file separate? We 'll probably \nwant to claim deductions, but if we do we'll have t o back them up, \nand that means we'll need all the receipts. Oh, my God窶祢 don't \nknow if we really have all the receipts we'd need a nd what if we \ndidn't have all the receipts but we claimed the ded uctions anyway \nand we got audited? Audited? Oh, no窶杯he IRS窶寧AIL!! \nAnd so a lot of people put themselves in jail, just  glancing at \ntheir 1040 tax forms. Because they're so smart, sen sitive, and cre- \native. In my many years of coaching individuals, th is pattern has \nbeen borne out more times than I can count窶盃sually it's the \nbrightest and most sophisticated folks who have the  most stuck \npiles, in their offices, homes, and heads. Most of the executives I \nwork with have at least several big, complex, and a morphous \n241 I am an old man \nand have known a \ngreat many \ntroubles, but most \nof them never \nhappened. \n窶熱ark \nTHE POWER OF THE KEY PRINCIPLES  I  PART THREE \nprojects stacked either on a credenza or on a menta l shelf.

Why is that? \nThink of how our bodies respond to the images we ho ld in our \nminds. It appears that the nervous system can't tel l the difference \nbetween a well-imagined thought and reality. \nTo prove this to yourself, picture yourself walking  into a \nsupermarket and going over to the brightly lit frui t-and-vegetable \nsection.

Now take a half lemon and cut that in half, \nso you have a quarter lemon wedge in your hands. \nOK, now窶排emember how you did this as a kid?窶能nput that quarter of a lemon in your mouth and bite \ninto it!

There \nalways seem to be hobgoblin thoughts lurking inside  them窶能n\"If \nwe don't look at or think about the projects, maybe\nthey'll stay quiet!\" \nSo what's the solution? There's always having a \ndrink. Numb it out. Dumb it down. Notice what \nhappens to many people when they get a little alco-\nhol on the brain. It should drop their energy imme-\ndiately, because it's a depressant; often, though, the energy lifts, at \nleast initially. Why? The alcohol is depressing something窶琶t's \nshutting down the negative self-talk and uncomforta ble visions \nthat are going on in these folks' minds. Of course my energy will \nincrease if I stop depressing myself with overwhelm ing pictures of \nnot handling something successfully. But the numb-o ut solutions \nare temporary at best. The \"stuff\" doesn't go away.  And unfortu- \nnately, when we numb ourselves out, we can't do it selectively窶能nthe source of inspiration and enthusiasm and person al energy also \nseems to get numbed. \nIntelligent Dumbing Down \nThere is another solution: intelligently dumbing do wn your brain \nby figuring out the next action. You'll invariably feel a relieving of \npressure about anything you have a commitment to ch ange or do, \nwhen you decide on the very next physical action re quired to \nmove it forward. Nothing, essentially, will change in \nthe world. But shifting your focus to something tha t \nyour mind perceives as a doable, completeable task \nwill create a real increase in positive energy, dir ection, \nand motivation. If you truly captured all the thing s \nthat have your attention during the mind-sweep, go \nthrough the list again now and decide on the single\nvery next action to take on every one of them. Noti ce \nwhat happens to your energy. \nYou are either attracted or repelled by the things \non your lists; there isn't any neutral territory. Y ou are \n242 Ceasing negative \nimaging will always \ncause your energy \nto increase. \nNo matter how big \nand tough a \nproblem may be, \nget rid of confusion \nby taking one little \nstep toward \nsolution. Do \nsomething. \n窶濡eorge \nF. \nCHAPTER 12  I  THE POWER OF THE NEXT-ACTION DECISION \neither positively drawn toward completing the actio n or reluctant \nto think about what it is and resistant to getting involved in it. \nOften it's simply the next-action decision that mak es the differ- \nence between the two extremes. \nIn following up with people who have taken my \nseminars or been coached by my colleagues or me, \nI've discovered that one of the subtler ways many o f \nthem fall off the wagon is in letting their action lists \ngrow back into lists of tasks or subprojects instea d of \ndiscrete next actions. They're still ahead of most peo- \nple because they're actually writing things down, b ut \nthey often find themselves stuck, and procrastinat-\ning, because they've allowed their action lists to har- \nbor items like: \n\"Meeting with the banquet committee\" \n\"Johnny's birthday\" \n\"Receptionist\" \n\"Slide presentation\" \nIn other words, things have morphed back into \"stuf f-ness \ninstead of staying at the action level. There are n o clear next \nactions here, and anyone keeping a list filled with  items like this \nwould send his or her brain into overload every tim e he/she \nlooked at it. \nIs this extra work? Is figuring out the next \naction on your commitments additional effort to \nexpend that you don't need to? No, of course not. I f \nyou need to get your car tuned, for instance, you'r e \ngoing to have to figure out that next action at som e \npoint anyway. The problem is that most people wait to do it until \nthe next action is \"Call the Auto Club for tow truc k!!\" \nSo when do you think most people really make a lot of their \nnext-action decisions about their stuff-窶背hen it sh ows up, or \nwhen it blows up? And do you think there might be a  difference \n243 Everything on your \nlists and in your \nstacks is either \nattractive or \nrepulsive to you窶能nthere's no neutral\nground when it\ncomes to your stuff.\nYou can only cure \nretail but you can \nprevent wholesale. \n窶韮rock Chisolm \nTHE POWER OF THE KEY PRINC",

There \nalways seem to be hobgoblin thoughts lurking inside  them窶能n\"If \nwe don't look at or think about the projects, maybe\nthey'll stay quiet!\" \nSo what's the solution? There's always having a \ndrink. Numb it out. Dumb it down. Notice what \nhappens to many people when they get a little alco-\nhol on the brain. It should drop their energy imme-\ndiately, because it's a depressant; often, though, the energy lifts, at \nleast initially. Why? The alcohol is depressing something窶琶t's \nshutting down the negative self-talk and uncomforta ble visions \nthat are going on in these folks' minds. Of course my energy will \nincrease if I stop depressing myself with overwhelm ing pictures of \nnot handling something successfully. But the numb-o ut solutions \nare temporary at best. The \"stuff\" doesn't go away.  And unfortu- \nnately, when we numb ourselves out, we can't do it selectively窶能nthe source of inspiration and enthusiasm and person al energy also \nseems to get numbed. \nIntelligent Dumbing Down \nThere is another solution: intelligently dumbing do wn your brain \nby figuring out the next action. You'll invariably feel a relieving of \npressure about anything you have a commitment to ch ange or do, \nwhen you decide on the very next physical action re quired to \nmove it forward. Nothing, essentially, will change in \nthe world. But shifting your focus to something tha t \nyour mind perceives as a doable, completeable task \nwill create a real increase in positive energy, dir ection, \nand motivation. If you truly captured all the thing s \nthat have your attention during the mind-sweep, go \nthrough the list again now and decide on the single\nvery next action to take on every one of them. Noti ce \nwhat happens to your energy. \nYou are either attracted or repelled by the things \non your lists; there isn't any neutral territory.

Which do you think is the \nmore efficient way to move through life窶播eciding \nnext actions on your projects as soon as they appea r \non your radar screen and then efficiently grouping \nthem into categories of actions that you get done i n \ncertain uniform contexts, or avoiding thinking abou t \nwhat exactly needs to be done until it has to be done, \nthen nickel-and-diming your activities as you try t o \ncatch up and put out the fires? \nThat may sound exaggerated, but when I ask groups o f peo- \nple to estimate when most of the action decisions a re made in \ntheir companies, with few exceptions they say, \"Whe n things \nblow up.\" One global corporate client surveyed its population \nabout sources of stress in its culture, and the num ber one com- \nplaint was the last-minute crisis work consistently  promoted by \nteam leaders who failed to make appropriate decisio ns on the \nfront end. \n244 The Value of a Next-Action \nDecision-Making Standard \nI have had several sophisticated senior executives tell me that \ninstalling \"What's the next action?\" as an operatio nal standard in \ntheir organizations was transformative in terms of measurable \nperformance output. It changed their culture perman ently and \nsignificantly for the better. \nWhy? Because the question forces clarity, accountab ility, \nproductivity, and empowerment. \nClarity \nToo many discussions end with only a vague sense th at people \nknow what they have decided and are going to do. Bu t without \na clear conclusion that there is a next action, much less what it is Avoiding action \ndecisions until the \npressure of the last \nminute creates huge \ninefficiencies and \nunnecessary stress. \nCHAPTER 12  | THE POWER OF THE NEXT-ACTION DECISION \nor who's got it, more often than not a lot of \"stuf f\" gets left up in \nthe air. \nI am frequently asked to facilitate meetings. I've learned the \nhard way that no matter where we are in the convers ation, twenty \nminutes before the agreed end-time of the discussio n I must force \nthe question: \"So what's the next action here?\" In my experience, \nthere is usually twenty minutes' worth of clarifyin g (and some- \ntimes tough decisions) still required to come up wi th an answer. \nThis is radical common sense窶排adical because it oft en \ncom- \npels discussion at deeper levels than people are co mfortable with. \n\"Are we serious about this?\" \"Do we really know wha t we're doing \nhere?\" \"Are we really ready to allocate precious ti me and resources \nto this?\" It's very easy to avoid these more releva nt levels of think- \ning. What prevents those issues from slipping away into amor- \nphous \"stuff\" is forcing the decision about the nex t action. Some \nfurther conversation, exploration, deliberation, an d negotiation \nare often needed to put the topic to rest. The worl d is too unpre- \ndictable these days to permit assumptions about out - \ncomes: we need to take responsibility for moving \nthings to clarity. \nYou have to have some experience of this to \nreally know what I mean here. If you do, you're \nprobably saying to yourself, \"Yes!\" If you're not s ure \nwhat I'm talking about, I suggest that in your next  meeting with \nanyone, you end the conversation with the question,  \"So what's \nthe next action here?\" Then notice what happens. \nAccountability \nThe dark side of \"collaborative cultures\" is the al lergy they foster \nto holding anyone responsible for having the ball. \"Mine or \nyours?\" is unfortunately not in the common vocabula ry of many \nsuch organizations. There is a sense that that woul d be impolite. \n\"We're all in this together\" is a worthy sentiment,  but seldom a \nreality in the hard-nosed day-to-day world of work.  Too many meet- \nings end with a vague feeling among the players tha t something \n245 Talk does not cook \nrice. \n窶任hinese \nTHE POWER OF THE KEY PRINCIPLES  I  PART THREE \nought to happen, and the hope that it's not their p ersonal job to \nmake it so. \nThe way I see it, what's truly impolite is allowing people to\nwalk away",

There is a sense that that woul d be impolite. \n\"We're all in this together\" is a worthy sentiment,  but seldom a \nreality in the hard-nosed day-to-day world of work.

I've learned the \nhard way that no matter where we are in the convers ation, twenty \nminutes before the agreed end-time of the discussio n I must force \nthe question: \"So what's the next action here?\" In my experience, \nthere is usually twenty minutes' worth of clarifyin g (and some- \ntimes tough decisions) still required to come up wi th an answer. \nThis is radical common sense窶排adical because it oft en \ncom- \npels discussion at deeper levels than people are co mfortable with. \n\"Are we serious about this?\" \"Do we really know wha t we're doing \nhere?\" \"Are we really ready to allocate precious ti me and resources \nto this?\" It's very easy to avoid these more releva nt levels of think- \ning. What prevents those issues from slipping away into amor- \nphous \"stuff\" is forcing the decision about the nex t action. Some \nfurther conversation, exploration, deliberation, an d negotiation \nare often needed to put the topic to rest.",

Real \"togethern ess\" of a \ngroup is reflected by the responsibility that all t ake for defining \nthe real things to do and the specific people assig ned to do them, \nso everyone is freed of the angst of still-undecide d actions. \nAgain, if you've been there, you'll know what I'm t alking \nabout. If you haven't, test it out窶杯ake a small ris k and ask \"So \nwhat's the next action on this?\" at the end of each  discussion point \nin your next staff meeting, or in your next \"family  conversation\" \naround the dinner table. \nProductivity \nOrganizations naturally become more productive when  they \nmodel and train front-end next-action decision-maki ng. For all \nthe reasons mentioned above, determining the requir ed physical \nallocation of resources necessary to make something\nhappen as soon as the outcome has been clarified wi ll \nproduce more results sooner, and with less effort. \nLearning to break through the barriers of the \nsophisticated   creative   thinking   that   can   freeze \nactivity窶杯hat is, the entangled psychic webs we \nspin窶琶s a superior skill. \"Productivity\" has been \ntouted for decades as a desirable thing to improve in \norganizations. Anything that can help maximize \noutput will do that. But in the world of knowledge \nwork, all the computers and telecom improvements \nand leadership seminars on the planet will make no \ndifference in this regard unless the individuals in volved increase \ntheir operational responsiveness. And that requires  thinking \nabout something that lands in your world before you have to. \nOne of the biggest productivity leaks I have seen i n some \norganizations is the lack of next actions determine d for \"long- \nterm\" projects. \"Long-term\" does not mean \"Someday/ Maybe.\" \n246 There are risks and \ncosts to a program \nof action, but they \nare far less than \nthe long-range '\nrisks and costs of \ncomfortable \ninaction. \n窶寧ohn \nF. \nCHAPTER 12  I  THE POWER OF THE NEXT-ACTION DECISION \nThose projects with distant goal lines are still to  be \ndone as soon as possible; \"long-term\" simply means,\n\"more action steps until it's done,\" not \"no need t o \ndecide next actions because the day of reckoning is  so \nfar away.\" When every project and open loop in an \norganization is being monitored, it's a whole new b all \ngame. \nEmpowerment \nPerhaps the greatest benefit of adopting the next- \naction approach is that it dramatically increases y our \nability to make things happen, with a concomitant r ise in your \nself-esteem and constructive outlook. \nPeople are constantly doing things, but usually onl y when \nthey have to, under fire from themselves or others.  They get no \nsense of winning, or of being in control, or of coo perating among \nthemselves and with their world. People are starvin g for those \nexperiences. \nThe daily behaviors that define the things that are  incom- \nplete and the moves that are needed to complete the m must \nchange. Getting things going of your own accord, be fore you're \nforced to by external pressure and internal stress,  builds a firm \nfoundation of self-worth that will spread into ever y aspect of your \nlife. You are the captain of your own ship; the mor e you act from \nthat perspective, the better things will go for you . \nAsking \"What's the next action?\" undermines the vic tim \nmentality. It presupposes that there is a possibili ty of change, and \nthat there is something you can do to make it happe n. That is the \nassumed affirmation in the behavior. And these kind s of \"assumed \naffirmations\" often work more fundamentally to buil d a positive \nself-image than can repeating \"I am a powerful, eff ective person, \nmaking things happen in my life!\" a thousand times.\nIs there too much complaining in your culture? The next \ntime someone moans about something, try asking, \"So  what's the \nnext action?\" People will complain only about somet hing that \n247 Productivity will\nimprove only when \nindividuals increase \ntheir operational\nresponsiveness.\nAnd in knowledge \nwork, that means \nclarifying actions on \nthe front end \ninstead of the back.\nTHE POWER OF THE KEY PRINCIPLES |  PART THREE \nthey assume could be better than it currently is.

They get no \nsense of winning, or of being in control, or of coo perating among \nthemselves and with their world. People are starvin g for those \nexperiences. \nThe daily behaviors that define the things that are  incom- \nplete and the moves that are needed to complete the m must \nchange. Getting things going of your own accord, be fore you're \nforced to by external pressure and internal stress,  builds a firm \nfoundation of self-worth that will spread into ever y aspect of your \nlife. You are the captain of your own ship; the mor e you act from \nthat perspective, the better things will go for you . \nAsking \"What's the next action?\" undermines the vic tim \nmentality. It presupposes that there is a possibili ty of change, and \nthat there is something you can do to make it happe n. That is the \nassumed affirmation in the behavior. And these kind s of \"assumed \naffirmations\" often work more fundamentally to buil d a positive \nself-image than can repeating \"I am a powerful, eff ective person, \nmaking things happen in my life!\" a thousand times.\nIs there too much complaining in your culture? The next \ntime someone moans about something, try asking, \"So  what's the \nnext action?\" People will complain only about somet hing that \n247 Productivity will\nimprove only when \nindividuals increase \ntheir operational\nresponsiveness.\n",

T he action ques- \ntion forces the issue. If it can be changed, there' s some action that \nwill change it. If it can't, it must be considered part of \nthe landscape to be incorporated in strategy and ta c- \ntics. Complaining is a sign that someone isn't will ing \nto risk moving on a changeable situation, or won't \nconsider the immutable circumstance in his or her \nplans. This is a temporary and hollow form of self-\nvalidation. \nAlthough my colleagues and I rarely promote \nour work in this way, I notice people really empowe r- \ning themselves every day as we coach them in apply-\ning the next-action technique. The light in their e yes \nand the lightness in their step increase, and a pos itive \nspark shows up in their thinking and demeanor. We \nare all already powerful, but deciding on and effec - \ntively managing the physical actions required to \nmove things forward seems to exercise that power in\nways that call forward the more positive aspects of\nour nature. \nWhen you start to make things happen, you really be gin to \nbelieve that you can make things happen. And that makes things \nhappen. \n248 People are always \nblaming their \ncircumstances for \nwhat they are. I \ndon't believe in \ncircumstances. The \npeople who get on \nin this world are \nthe people who get \nup and look for the \ncircumstances they \nwant, and, if they \ncan't find them, \n- make them. \n窶濡eorge Bernard \nShaw",

T he action ques- \ntion forces the issue. If it can be changed, there' s some action that \nwill change it. If it can't, it must be considered part of \nthe landscape to be incorporated in strategy and ta c- \ntics. Complaining is a sign that someone isn't will ing \nto risk moving on a changeable situation, or won't \nconsider the immutable circumstance in his or her \nplans. This is a temporary and hollow form of self-\nvalidation. \nAlthough my colleagues and I rarely promote \nour work in this way, I notice people really empowe r- \ning themselves every day as we coach them in apply-\ning the next-action technique. The light in their e yes \nand the lightness in their step increase, and a pos itive \nspark shows up in their thinking and demeanor. We \nare all already powerful, but deciding on and effec - \ntively managing the physical actions required to \nmove things forward seems to exercise that power in\nways that call forward the more positive aspects of\nour nature. \nWhen you start to make things happen, you really be gin to \nbelieve that you can make things happen. And that makes things \nhappen. \n248 People are always \nblaming their \ncircumstances for \nwhat they are. I \ndon't believe in \ncircumstances. The \npeople who get on \nin this world are \nthe people who get \nup and look for the \ncircumstances they \nwant, and, if they \ncan't find them, \n- make them. \n窶濡eorge Bernard \nShaw",
