Tinbergen—who\neventually won a Nobel Prize for his work—was\ninvestigating herring gulls, the gray and white birds often\nseen ﬂying along the seashores of North America.\nAdult herring gulls have a small red dot on their beak,\nand Tinbergen noticed that newly hatched chicks would\npeck this spot whenever they wanted food. T o begin one\nexperiment, he created a collection of fake cardboard\nbeaks, just a head without a body . When the parents had\nﬂown away , he went over to the nest and oﬀered these\ndummy beaks to the chicks. The beaks were obvious fakes,\nand he assumed the baby birds would reject them\naltogether .\nHowever , when the tiny gulls saw the red spot on the\ncardboard beak, they pecked away just as if it were\nattached to their own mother . They had a clear preference\nfor those red spots—as if they had been genetically\nprogrammed at birth. Soon Tinbergen discovered that the\nbigger the red spot, the faster the chicks pecked.\nEventually , he created a beak with three large red dots on\nit. When he placed it over the nest, the baby birds went\ncrazy with delight. They pecked at the little red patches as\nif it was the greatest beak they had ever seen.\nTinbergen and his colleagues discovered similar behavior\nin other animals. F or example, the greylag goose is a\nground-nesting bird. Occasionally , as the mother moves\naround on the nest, one of the eggs will roll out and settle\non the grass nearby . Whenever this happens, the goose will\nwaddle over to the egg and use its beak and neck to pull it\nback into the nest.\nTinbergen discovered that the goose will pull any nearby\nround object, such as a billiard ball or a lightbulb, back into\nthe nest. The bigger the object, the greater their response.\nOne goose even made a tremendous eﬀort to roll a\nvolleyball back and sit on top. Like the baby gulls\nautomatically pecking at red dots, the greylag goose was\nfollowing an instinctive rule: When I see a round object\nnearby , I must roll it back into the nest. The bigger the\nround object, the harder I should try to get it.\nIt’s like the brain of each animal is preloaded with\ncertain rules for behavior , and when it comes across an\nexaggerated version of that rule, it lights up like a\nChristmas tree. Scientists refer to these exaggerated cues\nas supernormal stimuli . A supernormal stimulus is a\nheightened version of reality—like a beak with three red\ndots or an egg the size of a volleyball—and it elicits a\nstronger response than usual.\nHumans are also prone to fall for exaggerated versions\nof reality . Junk food, for example, drives our reward\nsystems into a frenzy . After spending hundreds of\nthousands of years hunting and foraging for food in the\nwild, the human brain has evolved to place a high value on\nsalt, sugar , and fat. Such foods are often calorie-dense and\nthey were quite rare when our ancient ancestors were\nroaming the savannah. When you don’t know where your\nnext meal is coming from, eating as much as possible is an\nexcellent strategy for survival.\nToday, however , we live in a calorie-rich environment.\nFood is abundant, but your brain continues to crave it like\nit is scarce. Placing a high value on salt, sugar , and fat is no\nlonger advantageous to our health, but the craving persists\nbecause the brain’s reward centers have not changed for\napproximately ﬁfty thousand years. The modern food\nindustry relies on stretching our P aleolithic instincts\nbeyond their evolutionary purpose.\nA primary goal of food science is to create products that\nare more attractive to consumers. Nearly every food in a\nbag, box, or jar has been enhanced in some way , if only\nwith additional ﬂavoring. Companies spend millions of\ndollars to discover the most satisfying level of crunch in a\npotato chip or the perfect amount of ﬁzz in a soda. Entire\ndepartments are dedicated to optimizing how a product\nfeels in your mouth—a quality known as orosensation .\nFrench fries, for example, are a potent combination—\ngolden brown and crunchy on the outside, light and smooth\non the inside.\nOther processed foods enhance dynamic contrast , which\nrefers to items with",

Tinbergen—who\neventually won a Nobel Prize for his work—was\ninvestigating herring gulls, the gray and white birds often\nseen ﬂying along the seashores of North America.\nAdult herring gulls have a small red dot on their beak,\nand Tinbergen noticed that newly hatched chicks would\npeck this spot whenever they wanted food. T o begin one\nexperiment, he created a collection of fake cardboard\nbeaks, just a head without a body . When the parents had\nﬂown away , he went over to the nest and oﬀered these\ndummy beaks to the chicks. The beaks were obvious fakes,\nand he assumed the baby birds would reject them\naltogether .\nHowever , when the tiny gulls saw the red spot on the\ncardboard beak, they pecked away just as if it were\nattached to their own mother . They had a clear preference\nfor those red spots—as if they had been genetically\nprogrammed at birth. Soon Tinbergen discovered that the\nbigger the red spot, the faster the chicks pecked.\nEventually , he created a beak with three large red dots on\nit. When he placed it over the nest, the baby birds went\ncrazy with delight. They pecked at the little red patches as\nif it was the greatest beak they had ever seen.\nTinbergen and his colleagues discovered similar behavior\nin other animals. F or example, the greylag goose is a\nground-nesting bird. Occasionally , as the mother moves\naround on the nest, one of the eggs will roll out and settle\non the grass nearby . Whenever this happens, the goose will\nwaddle over to the egg and use its beak and neck to pull it\nback into the nest.\nTinbergen discovered that the goose will pull any nearby\nround object, such as a billiard ball or a lightbulb, back into\nthe nest. The bigger the object, the greater their response.\nOne goose even made a tremendous eﬀort to roll a\nvolleyball back and sit on top. Like the baby gulls\nautomatically pe",

They had a clear preference\nfor those red spots—as if they had been genetically\nprogrammed at birth. Soon Tinbergen discovered that the\nbigger the red spot, the faster the chicks pecked.\nEventually , he created a beak with three large red dots on\nit. When he placed it over the nest, the baby birds went\ncrazy with delight. They pecked at the little red patches as\nif it was the greatest beak they had ever seen.\nTinbergen and his colleagues discovered similar behavior\nin other animals. F or example, the greylag goose is a\nground-nesting bird. Occasionally , as the mother moves\naround on the nest, one of the eggs will roll out and settle\non the grass nearby . Whenever this happens, the goose will\nwaddle over to the egg and use its beak and neck to pull it\nback into the nest.\nTinbergen discovered that the goose will pull any nearby\nround object, such as a billiard ball or a lightbulb",

    "text": ", back into\nthe nest. The bigger the object, the greater their response.\nOne goose even made a tremendous eﬀort to roll a\nvolleyball back and sit on top. Like the baby gulls\nautomatically pecking at red dots, the greylag goose was\nfollowing an instinctive rule: When I see a round object\nnearby , I must roll it back into the nest. The bigger the\nround object, the harder I should try to get it.\nIt’s like the brain of each animal is preloaded with\ncertain rules for behavior , and when it comes across an\nexaggerated version of that rule, it lights up like a\nChristmas tree. Scientists refer to these exaggerated cues\nas supernormal stimuli . A supernormal stimulus is a\nheightened version of reality—like a beak with three red\ndots or an egg the size of a volleyball—and it elicits a\nstronger response than usual.\nHumans are also prone to fall for exaggerated versions\nof reality . Junk food, for example, drives our reward\nsystems into a frenzy . After spending hundreds of\nthousands of years hunting and foraging for food in the\nwild, the human brain has evolved to place a high value on\nsalt, sugar , and fat. Such foods are often calorie-dense and\nthey were quite rare when our ancient ancestors were\nroaming the savannah. When you don’t know where your\nnext meal is coming from, eating as much as possible is an\nexcellent strategy for survival.\nToday, however , we live in a calorie-rich environment.\nFood is abundant, but your brain continues to crave it like\nit is scarce. Placing a high value on salt, sugar , and fat is no\nlonger advantageous to our health, but the craving persists\nbecause the brain’s reward centers have not changed for\napproximately ﬁfty thousand years. The modern food\nindustry relies on stretching our P aleolithic instincts\nbeyond their evolutionary purpose.\nA primary goal of food science is to create products that\nare more attractive to consumers. Nearly every food in a\nbag, box, or jar has been enhanced in some way , if only\nwith additional ﬂavoring. Companies spend millions of\ndollars to discover the most satisfying level of crunch in a\npotato chip or the perfect amount of ﬁzz in a soda. Entire\ndepartments are dedicated to optimizing how a product\nfeels in your mouth",

After spending hundreds of\nthousands of years hunting and foraging for food in the\nwild, the human brain has evolved to place a high value on\nsalt, sugar , and fat. Such foods are often calorie-dense and\nthey were quite rare when our ancient ancestors were\nroaming the savannah. When you don’t know where your\nnext meal is coming from, eating as much as possible is an\nexcellent strategy for survival.\nToday, however , we live in a calorie-rich environment.\nFood is abundant, but your brain continues to crave it like\nit is scarce. Placing a high value on salt, sugar , and fat is no\nlonger advantageous to our health, but the craving persists\nbecause the brain’s reward centers have not changed for\napproximately ﬁfty thousand years. The modern food\nindustry relies on stretching our P aleolithic instincts\nbeyond their evolutionary purpose.\nA primary goal of food science is to create products that\nare more attractive to consumers. Nearly every food in a\nbag, box, or jar has been enhanced in some way , if only\nwith additional ﬂavoring",

    "text": "—a quality known as orosensation .\nFrench fries, for example, are a potent combination—\ngolden brown and crunchy on the outside, light and smooth\non the inside.\nOther processed foods enhance dynamic contrast , which\nrefers to items with a combination of sensations, like\ncrunchy and creamy . Imagine the gooeyness of melted\ncheese on top of a crispy pizza crust, or the crunch of an\nOreo cookie combined with its smooth center . With natural,\nunprocessed foods, you tend to experience the same\nsensations over and over— how’s that seventeenth bite of\nkale taste?  After a few minutes, your brain loses interest\nand you begin to feel full. But foods that are high in\ndynamic contrast keep the experience novel and\ninteresting, encouraging you to eat more.\nUltimately , such strategies enable food scientists to ﬁnd\nthe “bliss point” for each product—the precise combination\nof salt, sugar , and fat that excites your brain and keeps you\ncoming back for more. The result, of course, is that you\novereat because hyperpalatable foods are more attractive\nto the human brain. As Stephan Guyenet, a neuroscientist\nwho specializes in eating behavior and obesity , says, “ We’ve\ngotten too good at pushing our own buttons.”\nThe modern food industry , and the overeating habits it\nhas spawned, is just one example of the 2nd Law of\nBehavior Change: Make it attractive.  The more attractive\nan opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-\nforming.\nLook around. Society is ﬁlled with highly engineered\nversions of reality that are more attractive than the world\nour ancestors evolved in. Stores feature mannequins with\nexaggerated hips and breasts to sell clothes. Social media\ndelivers more “likes” and praise in a few minutes than we\ncould ever get in the oﬀice or at home. Online porn splices\ntogether stimulating scenes at a rate that would be\nimpossible to replicate in real life. Advertisements are\ncreated with a combination of ideal lighting, professional\nmakeup, and Photoshopped edits—even the model doesn’t\nlook like the person in the ﬁnal image. These are the\nsupernormal stimuli of our modern world. They exaggerate\nfeatures that are naturally attractive to us, and our\ninstincts go wild as a result, driving us into excessive\nshopping habits, social media habits, porn habits, eating\nhabits, and many others.\nIf history serves as a guide, the opportunities of the\nfuture will be more attractive than those of today . The\ntrend is for rewards to become more concentrated and\nstimuli to become more enticing. Junk food is a more\nconcentrated form of calories than natural foods. Hard\nliquor is a more concentrated form of alcohol than beer .\nVideo games are a more concentrated form of play than\nboard games. Compared to nature, these pleasure-packed\nexperiences are hard to resist. W e have the brains of our\nancestors but temptations they never had to face.\nIf you want to increase the odds that a behavior will\noccur , then you need to make it attractive. Throughout our\ndiscussion of the 2nd Law , our goal is to learn how to make\nour habits irresistible. While it is not possible to transform\nevery habit into a supernormal stimulus, we can make any\nhabit more enticing. T o do this, we must start by\nunderstanding what a craving is and how it works.\nWe begin by examining a biological signature that all\nhabits share—the dopamine spike.\nTHE DOP AMINE-DRIVEN FEEDBACK L OOP\nScientists can track the precise moment a craving occurs\nby measuring a neurotransmitter called dopamine. * The\nimportance of dopamine became apparent in 1954 when\nthe neuroscientists James Olds and P eter Milner ran an\nexperiment that revealed the neurological processes\nbehind craving and desire. By implanting electrodes in the\nbrains of rats, the researchers blocked the release of\ndopamine. T o the surprise of the scientists, the rats lost all\nwill to live. They wouldn’t eat. They wouldn’t have sex.\nThey didn’t crave anything. W ithin a few days, the animals\ndied of thirst.\nIn follow-up studies, other scientists also inhibited the\ndopamine-releasing parts of the brain, but this time, they\nsquirted little droplets of sugar into the mouths of the\ndopamine-depleted rats. Their little rat faces lit up with\npleasurable grins from the tasty substance. Even though\ndopamine was blocked, they liked  the sugar just as much as\nbefore; they just didn’t want  it anymore. The ability to\nexperience pleasure remained, but without dopamine,\ndesire died.",

Imagine the gooeyness of melted\ncheese on top of a crispy pizza crust, or the crunch of an\nOreo cookie combined with its smooth center . With natural,\nunprocessed foods, you tend to experience the same\nsensations over and over— how’s that seventeenth bite of\nkale taste?  After a few minutes, your brain loses interest\nand you begin to feel full. But foods that are high in\ndynamic contrast keep the experience novel and\ninteresting, encouraging you to eat more.\nUltimately , such strategies enable food scientists to ﬁnd\nthe “bliss point” for each product—the precise combination\nof salt, sugar , and fat that excites your brain and keeps you\ncoming back for more. The result, of course, is that you\novereat because hyperpalatable foods are more attractive\nto the human brain. As Stephan Guyenet, a neuroscientist\nwho specializes in eating behavior and obesity , says, “ We’ve\ngotten too good at pushing our own buttons.”\nThe modern food industry , and the overeating habits it\nhas spawned, is just one example of the 2nd Law of\nBehavior Change: Make it attractive.  The more attractive\nan opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-\nforming.\nLook around. Society is ﬁlled with highly engineered\nversions of reality that are more attractive than the world\nour ancestors evolved in. Stores feature mannequins with\nexaggerated hips and breasts to sell clothes. Social media\ndelivers more “likes” and praise in a few minutes than we\ncould ever get in the oﬀice or at home. Online porn splices\ntogether stimulating scenes at a rate that would be\nimpossible to replicate in real life. Advertisements are\ncreated with a combination of ideal lighting, professional\nmakeup, and Photoshopped edits—even the model doesn’t\nlook like the person in the ﬁnal image. These are the\nsupernormal stimuli of our modern world. They exaggerate\nfeatures that are naturally attractive to us, and our\ninstincts go wild as a result, driving us",

Imagine the gooeyness of melted\ncheese on top of a crispy pizza crust, or the crunch of an\nOreo cookie combined with its smooth center . With natural,\nunprocessed foods, you tend to experience the same\nsensations over and over— how’s that seventeenth bite of\nkale taste?  After a few minutes, your brain loses interest\nand you begin to feel full. But foods that are high in\ndynamic contrast keep the experience novel and\ninteresting, encouraging you to eat more.\nUltimately , such strategies enable food scientists to ﬁnd\nthe “bliss point” for each product—the precise combination\nof salt, sugar , and fat that excites your brain and keeps you\ncoming back for more. The result, of course, is that you\novereat because hyperpalatable foods are more attractive\nto the human brain. As Stephan Guyenet, a neuroscientist\nwho specializes in eating",

    "text": "look like the person in the ﬁnal image. These are the\nsupernormal stimuli of our modern world. They exaggerate\nfeatures that are naturally attractive to us, and our\ninstincts go wild as a result, driving us into excessive\nshopping habits, social media habits, porn habits, eating\nhabits, and many others.\nIf history serves as a guide, the opportunities of the\nfuture will be more attractive than those of today . The\ntrend is for rewards to become more concentrated and\nstimuli to become more enticing. Junk food is a more\nconcentrated form of calories than natural foods. Hard\nliquor is a more concentrated form of alcohol than beer .\nVideo games are a more concentrated form of play than\nboard games. Compared to nature, these pleasure-packed\nexperiences are hard to resist. W e have the brains of our\nancestors but temptations they never had to face.\nIf you want to increase the odds that a behavior will\noccur , then you need to make it attractive. Throughout our\ndiscussion of the 2nd Law , our goal is to learn how to make\nour habits irresistible. While it is not possible to transform\nevery habit into a supernormal stimulus, we can make any\nhabit more enticing. T o do this, we must start by\nunderstanding what a craving is and how it works.\nWe begin by examining a biological signature that all\nhabits share—the dopamine spike.\nTHE DOP AMINE-DRIVEN FEEDBACK L OOP\nScientists can track the precise moment a craving occurs\nby measuring a neurotransmitter called dopamine. * The\nimportance of dopamine became apparent in 1954 when\nthe neuroscientists James Olds and P eter Milner ran an\nexperiment that revealed the neurological processes\nbehind craving and desire. By implanting electrodes in the\nbrains of rats, the researchers blocked the release of\ndopamine. T o the surprise of the scientists, the rats lost all\nwill to live. They wouldn’t eat. They wouldn’t have sex.\nThey didn’t crave anything. W ithin a few days, the animals\ndied of thirst.\nIn follow-up studies, other scientists also inhibited the\ndopamine-releasing parts of the brain, but this time, they\nsquirted little droplets of sugar into the mouths of the\ndopamine-depleted rats. Their little rat faces lit up with\npleasurable grins from",

They exaggerate\nfeatures that are naturally attractive to us, and our\ninstincts go wild as a result, driving us into excessive\nshopping habits, social media habits, porn habits, eating\nhabits, and many others.\nIf history serves as a guide, the opportunities of the\nfuture will be more attractive than those of today . The\ntrend is for rewards to become more concentrated and\nstimuli to become more enticing. Junk food is a more\nconcentrated form of calories than natural foods. Hard\nliquor is a more concentrated form of alcohol than beer .\nVideo games are a more concentrated form of play than\nboard games. Compared to nature, these pleasure-packed\nexperiences are hard to resist. W e have the brains of our\nancestors but temptations they never had to face.\nIf you want to increase the odds that a behavior will\noccur , then you need to make it attractive. Throughout our\ndiscussion of the 2nd Law , our goal is to learn how to make\nour habits irresistible. While it is not possible to transform\nevery habit into a supernormal stimulus,",

    "text": " the tasty substance. Even though\ndopamine was blocked, they liked  the sugar just as much as\nbefore; they just didn’t want  it anymore. The ability to\nexperience pleasure remained, but without dopamine,\ndesire died. And without desire, action stopped.\nWhen other researchers reversed this process and\nﬂooded the reward system of the brain with dopamine,\nanimals performed habits at breakneck speed. In one study ,\nmice received a powerful hit of dopamine each time they\npoked their nose in a box. W ithin minutes, the mice\ndeveloped a craving so strong they began poking their nose\ninto the box eight hundred times per hour . (Humans are not\nso diﬀerent: the average slot machine player will spin the\nwheel six hundred times per hour .)\nHabits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. Every\nbehavior that is highly habit-forming—taking drugs, eating\njunk food, playing video games, browsing social media—is\nassociated with higher levels of dopamine. The same can be\nsaid for our most basic habitual behaviors like eating food,\ndrinking water , having sex, and interacting socially .\nFor years, scientists assumed dopamine was all about\npleasure, but now we know it plays a central role in many\nneurological processes, including motivation, learning and\nmemory , punishment and aversion, and voluntary\nmovement.\nWhen it comes to habits, the key takeaway is this:\ndopamine is released not only when you experience\npleasure, but also when you  anticipate  it. Gambling addicts\nhave a dopamine spike right before  they place a bet, not\nafter they win. Cocaine addicts get a surge of dopamine\nwhen they see the powder , not after they take it. Whenever\nyou predict that an opportunity will be rewarding, your\nlevels of dopamine spike in anticipation. And whenever\ndopamine rises, so does your motivation to act.\nIt is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulﬁllment of it\n—that gets us to take action.\nInterestingly , the reward system that is activated in the\nbrain when you receive  a reward is the same system that is\nactivated when you anticipate  a reward. This is one reason\nthe anticipation of an experience can often feel better than\nthe attainment of it. As a child, thinking about Christmas\nmorning can be better than opening the gifts. As an adult,\ndaydreaming about an upcoming vacation can be more\nenjoyable than actually being on vacation. Scientists refer\nto this as the diﬀerence between “wanting” and “liking.”\nTHE DOP AMINE SPIKE\n\nFIGURE 9:  Befor e a habit is lear ned (A), dopamine is r eleased\nwhen the r ewar d is e xperienced for the ﬁrst time. The ne xt time\naround (B), dopamine rises befor e taking action, immediately\nafter a cue is r ecognized. This spik e leads to a feeling of desir e\nand a craving to tak e action whenever the cue is spotted. Once\na habit is lear ned, dopamine will not rise when a r ewar d is\nexperienced because you alr eady e xpect the r ewar d. However, if\nyou see a cue and e xpect a r ewar d, but do not get one, then\ndopamine will dr op in disappointment (C). The sensitivity of the\ndopamine r esponse can clearly be seen when a r ewar d is\nprovided late (D). F irst, the cue is identiﬁed and dopamine rises\nas a craving builds. Ne xt, a r esponse is tak en but the r ewar d\ndoes not come as quickly as e xpected and dopamine begins to\ndrop. F inally, when the r ewar d comes a little later than you had\nhoped, dopamine spik es again. It is as if the brain is saying,\n“See! I knew I was right. Don’t for get to r epeat this action ne xt\ntime.”\nYour brain has far more neural circuitry allocated for\nwanting  rewards than for liking  them. The wanting centers\nin the brain are large: the brain stem, the nucleus\naccumbens, the ventral tegmental area, the dorsal\nstriatum, the amygdala, and portions of the prefrontal\ncortex. By comparison, the liking centers of the brain are\nmuch smaller . They are often referred to as “hedonic hot\nspots” and are distributed like tiny islands throughout the\nbrain. F or instance, researchers have found that 100\npercent of the nucleus accumbens is activated during\nwanting. Meanwhile, only 10 percent of the structure is\nactivated during liking.\nThe fact that the brain allocates so much precious space",

    "text": " the tasty substance. Even though\ndopamine was blocked, they liked  the sugar just as much as\nbefore; they just didn’t want  it anymore. The ability to\nexperience pleasure remained, but without dopamine,\ndesire died. And without desire, action stopped.\nWhen other researchers reversed this process and\nﬂooded the reward system of the brain with dopamine,\nanimals performed habits at breakneck speed. In one study ,\nmice received a powerful hit of dopamine each time they\npoked their nose in a box. W ithin minutes, the mice\ndeveloped a craving so strong they began poking their nose\ninto the box eight hundred times per hour . (Humans are not\nso diﬀerent: the average slot machine player will spin the\nwheel six hundred times per hour .)\nHabits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. Every\nbehavior that is highly habit-forming—taking drugs, eating\njunk food, playing video games, browsing social media—is\nassociated with higher levels of dopamine. The same can be\nsaid for our most basic habitual behaviors like eating food,\ndrinking water , having sex, and interacting socially .\nFor years, scientists assumed dopamine was all about\npleasure, but now we know it plays a central role in many\nneurological processes, including motivation, learning and\nmemory , punishment and aversion, and voluntary\nmovement.\nWhen it comes to habits, the key takeaway is this:\ndopamine is released not only when you experience\npleasure, but also when you  anticipate  it. Gambling addicts\nhave a dopamine spike right before  they place a bet, not\nafter they win. Cocaine addicts get a surge of dopamine\nwhen they see the powder , not after they take it. Whenever\nyou predict that an opportunity will be rewarding, your\nlevels of dopamine spike in anticipation. And whenever\ndopamine rises, so does your motivation to act.\nIt is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulﬁllment of it\n—that gets us to take action.\nInterestingly , the reward system that is activated in the\nbrain when you receive  a reward is the same system that is\nactivated when you anticipate  a reward. This is one reason\nthe anticipation of an experience can often feel better than\nthe attainment of it. As a child, thinking about Christmas\nmorning can be better than opening the gifts. As an adult,\ndaydreaming about an upcoming vacation can be more",

Every\nbehavior that is highly habit-forming—taking drugs, eating\njunk food, playing video games, browsing social media—is\nassociated with higher levels of dopamine. The same can be\nsaid for our most basic habitual behaviors like eating food,\ndrinking water , having sex, and interacting socially .\nFor years, scientists assumed dopamine was all about\npleasure, but",

The same can be\nsaid for our most basic habitual behaviors like eating food,\ndrinking water , having sex, and interacting socially .\nFor years, scientists assumed dopamine was all about\npleasure, but now we know it plays a central role in many\nneurological processes, including motivation, learning and\nmemory , punishment and aversion, and voluntary\nmovement.\nWhen it comes to habits, the key takeaway is this:\ndopamine is released not only when you experience\npleasure, but also when you  anticipate  it. Gambling addicts\nhave a dopamine spike right before  they place a bet, not\nafter they win. Cocaine addicts get a surge of dopamine\nwhen they see the powder , not after they take it. Whenever\nyou predict that an opportunity will be rewarding, your\nlevels of dopamine spike in anticipation.

    "text": " reason\nthe anticipation of an experience can often feel better than\nthe attainment of it. As a child, thinking about Christmas\nmorning can be better than opening the gifts. As an adult,\ndaydreaming about an upcoming vacation can be more\nenjoyable than actually being on vacation. Scientists refer\nto this as the diﬀerence between “wanting” and “liking.”\nTHE DOP AMINE SPIKE\n\nFIGURE 9:  Befor e a habit is lear ned (A), dopamine is r eleased\nwhen the r ewar d is e xperienced for the ﬁrst time. The ne xt time\naround (B), dopamine rises befor e taking action, immediately\nafter a cue is r ecognized. This spik e leads to a feeling of desir e\nand a craving to tak e action whenever the cue is spotted. Once\na habit is lear ned, dopamine will not rise when a r ewar d is\nexperienced because you alr eady e xpect the r ewar d. However, if\nyou see a cue and e xpect a r ewar d, but do not get one, then\ndopamine will dr op in disappointment (C). The sensitivity of the\ndopamine r esponse can clearly be seen when a r ewar d is\nprovided late (D). F irst, the cue is identiﬁed and dopamine rises\nas a craving builds. Ne xt, a r esponse is tak en but the r ewar d\ndoes not come as quickly as e xpected and dopamine begins to\ndrop. F inally, when the r ewar d comes a little later than you had\nhoped, dopamine spik es again. It is as if the brain is saying,\n“See! I knew I was right. Don’t for get to r epeat this action ne xt\ntime.”\nYour brain has far more neural circuitry allocated for\nwanting  rewards than for liking  them. The wanting centers\nin the brain are large: the brain stem, the nucleus\naccumbens, the ventral tegmental area, the dorsal\nstriatum, the amygdala, and portions of the prefrontal\ncortex. By comparison, the liking centers of the brain are\nmuch smaller . They are often referred to as “hedonic hot\nspots” and are distributed like tiny islands throughout the\nbrain. F",

Meanwhile, only 10 percent of the structure is\nactivated during liking.\nThe fact that the brain allocates so much precious space\nto the regions responsible for craving and desire provides\nfurther evidence of the crucial role these processes play .\nDesire is the engine that drives behavior . Every action is\ntaken because of the anticipation that precedes it. It is the\ncraving that leads to the response.\nThese insights reveal the importance of the 2nd Law of\nBehavior Change. W e need to make our habits attractive\nbecause it is the expectation of a rewarding experience that\nmotivates us to act in the ﬁrst place. This is where a\nstrategy known as temptation bundling comes into play .\nHOW TO USE TEMPT ATION BUNDLING TO MAKE Y OUR\nHABITS MORE A TTRACTIVE\nRonan Byrne, an electrical engineering student in Dublin,\nIreland, enjoyed watching Netﬂix, but he also knew that he\nshould exercise more often than he did. Putting his\nengineering skills to use, Byrne hacked his stationary bike\nand connected it to his laptop and television. Then he wrote\na computer program that would allow Netﬂix to run only if\nhe was cycling at a certain speed. If he slowed down for too\nlong, whatever show he was watching would pause until he\nstarted pedaling again. He was, in the words of one fan,\n“eliminating obesity one Netﬂix binge at a time.”\nHe was also employing temptation bundling to make his\nexercise habit more attractive. T emptation bundling works\nby linking an action you want to do with an action you need\nto do . In Byrne’s case, he bundled watching Netﬂix (the\nthing he wanted to do) with riding his stationary bike (the\nthing he needed to do).\nBusinesses are masters at temptation bundling. F or\ninstance, when the American Broadcasting Company , more\ncommonly known as AB C, launched its Thursday-night\ntelevision lineup for the 2014–2015 season, they promoted\ntemptation bundling on a massive scale.\nEvery Thursday , the company would air three shows\ncreated by screenwriter Shonda Rhimes— Grey’s Anatomy ,\nScandal , and How to Get A way with Murder . They branded\nit as “TGIT on AB C” (TGIT stands for Thank God It’s\nThursday). In addition to promoting the shows, AB C\nencouraged viewers to make popcorn, drink red wine, and\nenjoy the evening.\nAndrew K ubitz, head of scheduling for AB C, described\nthe idea behind the campaign: “ We see Thursday night as a\nviewership opportunity , with either couples or women by\nthemselves who want to sit down and escape and have fun\nand drink their red wine and have some popcorn.” The\nbrilliance of this strategy is that AB C was associating the\nthing they needed  viewers to do (watch their shows) with\nactivities their viewers already  wanted  to do (relax, drink\nwine, and eat popcorn).\nOver time, people began to connect watching AB C with\nfeeling relaxed and entertained. If you drink red wine and\neat popcorn at 8 p.m. every Thursday , then eventually “8\np.m. on Thursday” means  relaxation and entertainment.\nThe reward gets associated with the cue, and the habit of\nturning on the television becomes more attractive.\nYou’re more likely to ﬁnd a behavior attractive if you get\nto do one of your favorite things at the same time. P erhaps\nyou want to hear about the latest celebrity gossip, but you\nneed to get in shape. Using temptation bundling, you could\nonly read the tabloids and watch reality shows at the gym.\nMaybe you want to get a pedicure, but you need to clean\nout your email inbox. Solution: only get a pedicure while\nprocessing overdue work emails.\nTemptation bundling is one way to apply a psychology\ntheory known as Premack’s Principle. Named after the\nwork of professor David Premack, the principle states that\n“more probable behaviors will reinforce less probable\nbehaviors.” In other words, even if you don’t really want to\nprocess overdue work emails, you’ll become conditioned to\ndo it if it means you get to do something you really want to\ndo along the way .\nYou can even combine temptation bundling with the\nhabit stacking strategy we discussed in Chapter 5 to create\na set of rules to guide your behavior .\nThe habit stacking + temptation bundling formula\nis:\n1. After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [HABIT I NEED].\n2. After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I",

Meanwhile, only 10 percent of the structure is\nactivated during liking.\nThe fact that the brain allocates so much precious space\nto the regions responsible for craving and desire provides\nfurther evidence of the crucial role these processes play .\nDesire is the engine that drives behavior . Every action is\ntaken because of the anticipation that precedes it. It is the\ncraving that leads to the response.\nThese insights reveal the importance of the 2nd Law of\nBehavior Change. W e need to make our habits attractive\nbecause it is the expectation of a rewarding experience that\nmotivates us to act in the ﬁrst place. This is where a\nstrategy known as temptation bundling comes into play .\nHOW TO USE TEMPT ATION BUNDLING TO MAKE Y OUR\nHABITS MORE A TTRACTIVE\nRonan Byrne, an electrical engineering student in Dublin,\nIreland, enjoyed watching Netﬂix, but he also knew that he\nshould exercise more often than he did. Putting his\nengineering skills to use, Byrne hacked his stationary bike\nand connected it to his laptop and television. Then he wrote\na computer program that would allow Netﬂix to run only if\nhe was cycling at a certain speed. If he slowed down for too\nlong, whatever show he was watching would pause until he\nstarted pedaling again. He was, in the words of one fan,\n“eliminating obesity one Netﬂix binge at a time.”\nHe was also employing temptation bundling to make his\nexercise habit more attractive. T emptation bundling works\nby linking an action you want to do with an action you need\nto do . In Byrne’s case, he bundled watching Netﬂix (the\nthing he wanted to do) with riding his stationary bike (the\nthing he needed to do).\nBusinesses are masters at temptation bundling. F or\ninstance, when the American Broadcasting Company , more\ncommonly known as AB C, launched its Thursday-night\ntelevision lineup for the 2014–2015 season, they promoted\ntemptation bundling on a massive scale.\nEvery Thursday , the company would air three shows\ncreated by screenwriter Shonda Rhimes— Grey’s Anatomy ,\nScandal , and How to Get A way with Murder . They branded\nit as “TGIT on AB",

    "text": "Ireland, enjoyed watching Netﬂix, but he also knew that he\nshould exercise more often than he did. Putting his\nengineering skills to use, Byrne hacked his stationary bike\nand connected it to his laptop and television. Then he wrote\na computer program that would allow Netﬂix to run only if\nhe was cycling at a certain speed. If he slowed down for too\nlong, whatever show he was watching would pause until he\nstarted pedaling again. He was, in the words of one fan,\n“eliminating obesity one Netﬂix binge at a time.”\nHe was also employing temptation bundling to make his\nexercise habit more attractive. T emptation bundling works\nby linking an action you want to do with an action you need\nto do . In Byrne’s case, he bundled watching Netﬂix (the\nthing he wanted to do) with riding his stationary bike (the\nthing he needed to do).\nBusinesses are masters at temptation bundling. F or\ninstance, when the American Broadcasting Company , more\ncommonly known as AB C, launched its Thursday-night\ntelevision lineup for the 2014–2015 season, they promoted\ntemptation bundling",

They branded\nit as “TGIT on AB C” (TGIT stands for Thank God It’s\nThursday). In addition to promoting the shows, AB C\nencouraged viewers to make popcorn, drink red wine, and\nenjoy the evening.\nAndrew K ubitz, head of scheduling for AB C, described\nthe idea behind the campaign: “ We see Thursday night as a\nviewership opportunity , with either couples or women by\nthemselves who want to sit down and escape and have fun\nand drink their red wine and have some popcorn.” The\nbrilliance of this strategy is that AB C was associating the\nthing they needed  viewers to do (watch their shows) with\nactivities their viewers already  wanted  to do (relax, drink\nwine, and eat popcorn).\nOver time, people began to connect watching AB C with\nfeeling relaxed and entertained. If you drink red wine and\neat popcorn at 8 p.m. every Thursday , then eventually “8\np.m. on Thursday” means  relaxation and entertainment.\nThe reward gets associated with the cue, and the habit of\nturning on the television becomes more attractive.\nYou’re more likely to ﬁnd a behavior attractive if you get\nto do one of your favorite things at the same time. P erhaps\nyou want to hear about the latest celebrity gossip, but you\nneed to get in shape. Using temptation bundling, you could\nonly read the tabloids and watch reality shows at the gym.\nMaybe you want to get a pedicure, but you need to clean\nout your email inbox. Solution: only get a pedicure while\nprocessing overdue work emails.\nTemptation bundling is one way to apply a psychology\ntheory known as Premack’s Principle. Named after the\nwork of professor David Premack, the principle states that\n“more probable behaviors will reinforce less probable\nbehaviors.” In other words, even if you don’t really want to\nprocess overdue work emails, you’ll become conditioned to\ndo it if it means you get to do something you really want to\ndo along the way .\nYou can even combine temptation bundling with the\nhabit stacking strategy we discussed in Chapter 5 to create\na set of rules to",

    "text": " on a massive scale.\nEvery Thursday , the company would air three shows\ncreated by screenwriter Shonda Rhimes— Grey’s Anatomy ,\nScandal , and How to Get A way with Murder . They branded\nit as “TGIT on AB C” (TGIT stands for Thank God It’s\nThursday). In addition to promoting the shows, AB C\nencouraged viewers to make popcorn, drink red wine, and\nenjoy the evening.\nAndrew K ubitz, head of scheduling for AB C, described\nthe idea behind the campaign: “ We see Thursday night as a\nviewership opportunity , with either couples or women by\nthemselves who want to sit down and escape and have fun\nand drink their red wine and have some popcorn.” The\nbrilliance of this strategy is that AB C was associating the\nthing they needed  viewers to do (watch their shows) with\nactivities their viewers already  wanted  to do (relax, drink\nwine, and eat popcorn).\nOver time, people began to connect watching AB C with\nfeeling relaxed and entertained. If you drink red wine and\neat popcorn at 8 p.m. every Thursday , then eventually “8\np.m. on Thursday”",

After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I W ANT].\nIf you want to read the news, but you need to express\nmore gratitude:\n1. After I get my morning coﬀee, I will say one thing I’m\ngrateful for that happened yesterday (need).\n2. After I say one thing I’m grateful for , I will read the\nnews (want).\nIf you want to watch sports, but you need to make sales\ncalls:\n1. After I get back from my lunch break, I will call three\npotential clients (need).\n2. After I call three potential clients, I will check ESPN\n(want).\nIf you want to check F acebook, but you need to exercise\nmore:\n1. After I pull out my phone, I will do ten burpees (need).\n2. After I do ten burpees, I will check F acebook (want).\nThe hope is that eventually you’ll look forward to calling\nthree clients or doing ten burpees because it means you get\nto read the latest sports news or check F acebook. Doing the\nthing you need to do means you get to do the thing you\nwant to do .\nWe began this chapter by discussing supernormal\nstimuli, which are heightened versions of reality that\nincrease our desire to take action. T emptation bundling is\none way to create a heightened version of any habit by\nconnecting it with something you already want.\nEngineering a truly irresistible habit is a hard task, but this\nsimple strategy can be employed to make nearly any habit\nmore attractive than it would be otherwise.\nChapter Summary\nThe 2nd Law of Behavior Change is make it attractive.\nThe more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it\nis to become habit-forming.\nHabits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. When\ndopamine rises, so does our motivation to act.\nIt is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulﬁllment of\nit—that gets us to take action. The greater the\nanticipation, the greater the dopamine spike.\nTemptation bundling is one way to make your habits\nmore attractive. The strategy is to pair an action you\nwant  to do with an action you need  to do.",

After I say one thing I’m grateful for , I will read the\nnews (want).\nIf you want to watch sports, but you need to make sales\ncalls:\n1.

After I call three potential clients, I will check ESPN\n(want).\nIf you want to check F acebook, but you need to exercise\nmore:\n1. After I pull out my phone, I will do ten burpees (need).\n2. After I do ten burpees, I will check F acebook (want).\nThe hope is that eventually you’ll look forward to calling\nthree clients or doing ten burpees because it means you get\nto read the latest sports news or check F acebook. Doing the\nthing you need to do means you get to do the thing you\nwant to do .\nWe began this chapter by discussing supernormal\nstimuli, which are heightened versions of reality that\nincrease our desire to take action. T emptation bundling is\none way to create a heightened version of any habit by\nconnecting it with something you already want.\nEngineering a truly irresistible habit is a hard task, but this\nsimple strategy can be employed to make nearly any habit\nmore attractive than it would be otherwise.\nChapter Summary\nThe 2nd Law of Behavior Change is make it attractive.\nThe more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it\nis to become habit-forming.\nHabits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. When\ndopamine rises, so does our motivation to act.\nIt is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulﬁllment of\nit—that gets us to take action. The greater the\nanticipation, the greater the dopamine spike.\nTemptation bundling is one way to make your habits\nmore attractive. The strategy is to pair an action you\nwant  to do with an action you need  to do.",
