    "text": "14. USING THE SWISS CHEESE METHOD \nWHILE A CAREFULLY THOUGHT-OUT plan with well-defined \ngoals and priorities is a giant step toward getting control of \nyour time (and your life), even good planners often manage \nto forget one detail: A plan, like any tool, is valuable only if \nit's used. The best plans remain daydreams until you bring \nthem to life through action. \n^n the case of most routine tasks—such as eating or brush­\ning your teeth—planning leads directly to action. Even when \nyou tackle more complex activities, planning and doing may \nbe so closely tied together that they seem parts of the same \nstep. A good plan—a plan that in all ways feels right to \nyou—has a way of getting you to act on it simply because it's \nin front of you. After you finish such a plan, it draws you \nright into starting on the high-priority items. \nAt other times this transition from planning to action goes \nless smoothly. Let's assume that as a result of your planning \n(Listing/Setting Priorities, answering Lakein's Question) \nyou've zeroed in on a particular task as your A-l: Today \nyou're going to wash all the windows in the house! But in­\nstead of acting on your plan, you hesitate. Perhaps you feel \nlike turning to a less-important task, or quitting for the day \nto go to a movie or merely to draw doodles in the dirt on the \nwindows. Your attitude toward doing the A-l is \"do it later\" \nrather than \"do it now.\" Perhaps, for reasons I've discussed \nearlier (see Chapter 10), you'll settle on doing a C-task. \nFve talked with thousands of people about their efforts to \ngain control of their time and their lives. Again and again I \nhear the familiar refrain, \"For years I've been wanting to do \nthis, but I keep putting it off,\" or \"I know just what to do \nbut I can't find time to get started.\" \nProcrastination! It's one of the major stumbling blocks ev­\nerybody faces in trying to achieve both short-term and \n100 \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 101 \nlong-term goals. But rather than let procrastination seize con­\ntrol of you, how about doing something positive? \nHave Yon Picked the Correct A-l? \nWhen you've identified an A-l but find yourself reluctant \nto \"do it now,\" take a fresh look at your choice. Your reluc­\ntance may be based on an intuitive feeling that the A-l is not, \nafter all, the best use of your time. Your intuition is often \nright. Avoiding the A-l may be a smarter decision than your \nselection of the A^l in the first place. Suppose your A-l is \nlearning how to sail, but you find that the instructor charges \nmore than you can afford. Not following through on your \nplan may be the wisest course. \nPerhaps your choice of an A-l was the right one at the \ntime, but now your priorities have suddenly and unexpectedly \nshifted. You have to forego spring housecleaning this week \nbecause Aunt Mary from Boston arrives on your doorstep \nthree days early for her annual visit. Or you sit down at your \ndesk to pay some bills when the mailman delivers a letter \nfrom your bank saying your last check bounced. Obviously, \nyour A-l is to straighten out your messed-up checking ac­\ncount; paying the bills will have to wait. \nPutting off work on an A-l is also wise when you find it \nwill lead to consequences you didn't foresee when you sat \ndown to plan. An advertising executive had decided that the \nbest use of his time would be to respond to a big manufac­\nturer's request for a preliminary presentation of an advertis­\ning campaign that might bring the advertising man a lot of \nadditional business. He was disturbed because he had failed \nto follow through on this request for several weeks. \nAfter brooding about this failure, he finally realized what \nwas holding him back. Although this was an account he had \nlong wanted, he knew that if he landed it, he would spend \nthe next several months designing a huge campaign from \nscratch. But he already felt terribly overworked as it was. No \nwonder he was reluctant to tackle his A-l! \nOnce the advertising executive realized this, he knew that \nhis problem was not procrastination but a matter of priori­\nties. His real A-l should have been to do something to ease \n(rather than add to) his work pressures, so he spent the next \n102 ALAN LAKE IN \nweek training a subordinate to take over some of his routine \nwork. Only then did he go",

USING THE SWISS CHEESE METHOD \nWHILE A CAREFULLY THOUGHT-OUT plan with well-defined \ngoals and priorities is a giant step toward getting control of \nyour time (and your life), even good planners often manage \nto forget one detail: A plan, like any tool, is valuable only if \nit's used. The best plans remain daydreams until you bring \nthem to life through action. \n^n the case of most routine tasks—such as eating or brush­\ning your teeth—planning leads directly to action. Even when \nyou tackle more complex activities, planning and doing may \nbe so closely tied together that they seem parts of the same \nstep. A good plan—a plan that in all ways feels right to \nyou—has a way of getting you to act on it simply because it's \nin front of you. After you finish such a plan, it draws you \nright into starting on the high-priority items. \nAt other times this transition from planning to action goes \nless smoothly. Let's assume that as a result of your planning \n(Listing/Setting Priorities, answering Lakein's Question) \nyou've zeroed in on a particular task as your A-l: Today \nyou're going to wash all the windows in the house! But in­\nstead of acting on your plan, you hesitate. Perhaps you feel \nlike turning to a less-important task, or quitting for the day \nto go to a movie or merely to draw doodles in the dirt on the \nwindows. Your attitude toward doing the A-l is \"do it later\" \nrather than \"do it now.\" Perhaps, for reasons I've discussed \nearlier (see Chapter 10), you'll settle on doing a C-task. \nFve talked with thousands of people about their efforts to \ngain control of their time and their lives. Again and again I \nhear the familiar refrain, \"For years I've been wanting to do \nthis, but I keep putting it off,\" or \"I know just what to do \nbut I can't find time to get started.\" \nProcrastination! It's one of the major stumbling blocks ev­\nerybody faces in trying to achieve both short-term and \n100 \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 101 \nlong-term goals. But rather than let procrastination seize con­\ntrol of you, how about doing something positive? \nHave Yon Picked the",

But rather than let procrastination seize con­\ntrol of you, how about doing something positive? \nHave Yon Picked the Correct A-l? \nWhen you've identified an A-l but find yourself reluctant \nto \"do it now,\" take a fresh look at your choice. Your reluc­\ntance may be based on an intuitive feeling that the A-l is not, \nafter all, the best use of your time. Your intuition is often \nright. Avoiding the A-l may be a smarter decision than your \nselection of the A^l in the first place. Suppose your A-l is \nlearning how to sail, but you find that the instructor charges \nmore than you can afford. Not following through on your \nplan may be the wisest course. \nPerhaps your choice of an A-l was the right one at the \ntime, but now your priorities have suddenly and unexpectedly \nshifted. You have to forego spring housecleaning this week \nbecause Aunt Mary from Boston arrives on your doorstep \nthree days early for her annual visit. Or you sit down at your \ndesk to pay some bills when the mailman delivers a letter \nfrom your bank saying your last check bounced.

An advertising executive had decided that the \nbest use of his time would be to respond to a big manufac­\nturer's request for a preliminary presentation of an advertis­\ning campaign that might bring the advertising man a lot of \nadditional business. He was disturbed because he had failed \nto follow through on this request for several weeks. \nAfter brooding about this failure, he finally realized what \nwas holding him back. Although this was an account he had \nlong wanted, he knew that if he landed it, he would spend \nthe next several months designing a huge campaign from \nscratch. But he already felt terribly overworked as it was. No \nwonder he was reluctant to tackle his A-l! \nOnce the advertising executive realized this, he knew that \nhis problem was not procrastination but a matter of priori­\nties. His real A-l should",

Or you sit down at your \ndesk to pay some bills when the mailman delivers a letter \nfrom your bank saying your last check bounced. Obviously, \nyour A-l is to straighten out your messed-up checking ac­\ncount; paying the bills will have to wait. \nPutting off work on an A-l is also wise when you find it \nwill lead to consequences you didn't foresee when you sat \ndown to plan. An advertising executive had decided that the \nbest use of his time would be to respond to a big manufac­\nturer's request for a preliminary presentation of an advertis­\ning campaign that might bring the advertising man a lot of \nadditional business. He was disturbed because he had failed \nto follow through on this request for several weeks. \nAfter brooding about this failure, he finally realized what \nwas holding him back. Although this was an account he had \nlong wanted, he knew that if he landed it, he would spend \nthe next several months designing a huge campaign from \nscratch. But he already felt terribly overworked",

    "text": " have been to do something to ease \n(rather than add to) his work pressures, so he spent the next \n102 ALAN LAKE IN \nweek training a subordinate to take over some of his routine \nwork. Only then did he go back to thinking about the new \naccount. He started in immediately, and, no longer held back \nby his former reluctance, he created a stunning proposal \nthat landed the account. \nSo if you don't follow through on a plan because the \nchoice is not current or valid, your delay is not due to pro­\ncrastination, but to a~desire to be flexible and adaptable. \nYou're right not to go forward with your first A-l. The best \ncourse is to downgrade the former A-l. Pick out a new A-l \nthat better fits your changed priorities or unexpected oppor­\ntunities, and make sure you \"do it now.\" \nProcrastination is . . • \nProcrastination is when you've come up with a good A-l \nactivity, validated your choice, and found at least some min­\nutes you could have spent on that A-l, and you are still not \nwith it. Instead, you are doing a lesser A, a B, a C, or maybe \neven a task that you should admit is not worth doing at ah. \nWhat in the world is wrong with you? \nMostly, you're just being human. And like most of my \nclients you undoubtedly procrastinate most on \"Overwhelm­\ning A-ls\" and \"Unpleasant A-ls.\" People put off doing an \nOverwhelming A-l because it seems too complex or too \ntime-consuming (such as washing all the windows, redecorat­\ning the house, cataloging the slides of your last six years' va­\ncations, mastering Russian, preparing your tax return when \nyou claim a lot of deductions, moving to a new house, selling \nyour business to retire, planning a trip around the world). \nAn Unpleasant A-l, on the other hand, is manageable, all \nright, but you're eager to avoid it because of some odious as­\nsociation, which is usually emotional (disciplining an em­\nployee, admitting an awkward mistake to your boss, telling \nyour boss he made a mistake, presenting your husband with \nthe bill for a very expensive dress). \nThese two categories are not mutually exclusive. Anybody \ncan think of activities that seem both overwhelming and un-\nthe strategies for dealing with each are different. The next \nseveral chapters will be devoted to a discussion of how to \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 103 \nhandle the problem of procrastination on an Overwhelming \nA-l. After that I will turn to ways to stop procrastinating on \nthe Unpleasant A-l. \nCAUTION: All the techniques to stop procrastinating are to \nbe used only when genuinely necessary. It would be a great \nwaste of your time to keep working with these techniques \nrather than doing your A-l. The goal, as ever, is to select \nyour A-l and do it now. The techniques are simply means to \nan end and that end is to make better use of your time. \nHow to Overwhelm the Overwhelming A-l \nSuppose you're at home and have just finished some \nchores. Your son will return from school in half an hour. \nYou'd like to start on a painting you've been thinking about \nfor weeks, but you wash up a few dirty dishes and mop the \nkitchen floor instead. After all, how can you possibly accom­\nplish anything on your painting when you know you'll be in­\nterrupted so soon? \nOr suppose you're at work and you've just finished a phone \ncall. As you put down the receiver, you think to yourself that \nthe best use of your time right now—the A-l—is to start \nwork on the time-consuming, complex task of preparing the \nannual budget for your department. You glance at your \nwatch. It's ten minutes before you usually go to lunch. A \nstack of routine paperwork is sitting on one corner of your \ndesk, awaiting your attention. What should you do? Get a \ncouple of quick paperwork Cs out of the way? Or put ten \nminutes into the A-l-task, even though you feel quite over­\nwhelmed by the prospect? Or go to lunch early? \nThe best answer—which is to get started on that Over­\nwhelming A-l even with only a few minutes at your dis­\nposal—seem unrealistic, even meaningless. You may well \ndecide to get a few easy C's out of the way instead. On the \nface of it, this does not seem to be a very serious breach of \ngood time-management practices, except that a person's day is \ntypically",

Only then did he go back to thinking about the new \naccount. He started in immediately, and, no longer held back \nby his former reluctance, he created a stunning proposal \nthat landed the account. \nSo if you don't follow through on a plan because the \nchoice is not current or valid, your delay is not due to pro­\ncrastination, but to a~desire to be flexible and adaptable. \nYou're right not to go forward with your first A-l. The best \ncourse is to downgrade the former A-l. Pick out a new A-l \nthat better fits your changed priorities or unexpected oppor­\ntunities, and make sure you \"do it now.\" \nProcrastination is . . • \nProcrastination is when you've come up with a good A-l \nactivity, validated your choice, and found at least some min­\nutes you could have spent on that A-l, and you are still not \nwith it. Instead, you are doing a lesser A, a B, a C, or maybe \neven a task that you should admit is not worth doing at ah. \nWhat in the world is wrong with you? \nMostly, you're just being human. And like most of my \nclients you undoubtedly procrastinate most on \"Overwhelm­\ning A-ls\" and \"Unpleasant A-ls.\" People put off doing an \nOverwhelming A-l because it seems too complex or too \ntime-consuming (such as washing all the windows, redecorat­\ning the house, cataloging the slides of your last six years' va­\ncations, mastering Russian, preparing your tax return when \nyou claim a lot of deductions, moving to a new house, selling \nyour business to retire, planning a trip around the world). \nAn Unpleasant A-l, on the other hand, is manageable, all \nright, but you're eager to avoid it because of some odious as­\nsociation, which is usually emotional (disciplining an em­\nployee, admitting an awkward mistake to your boss, telling \nyour boss he made a mistake, presenting your husband with \nthe bill for a very expensive dress). \nThese two categories are not mutually exclusive.

Anybody \ncan think of activities that seem both overwhelming and un-\nthe strategies for dealing with each are different. The next \nseveral chapters will be devoted to a discussion of how to \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 103 \nhandle the problem of procrastination on an Overwhelming \nA-l. After that I will turn to ways to stop procrastinating on \nthe Unpleasant A-l. \nCAUTION: All the techniques to stop procrastinating are to \nbe used only when genuinely necessary. It would be a great \nwaste of your time to keep working with these techniques \nrather than doing your A-l. The goal, as ever, is to select \nyour A-l and do it now.

Your son will return from school in half an hour. \nYou'd like to start on a painting you've been thinking about \nfor weeks, but you wash up a few dirty dishes and mop the \nkitchen floor instead.

As you put down the receiver, you think to yourself that \nthe best use of your time right now—the A-l—is to start \nwork on the time-consuming, complex task of preparing the \nannual budget for your department. You glance at your \nwatch. It's ten minutes before you usually go to lunch. A \nstack of routine paperwork is sitting on one corner of your \ndesk, awaiting your attention. What should you do? Get a \ncouple of quick paperwork Cs out of the way? Or put ten \nminutes into the A-l-task, even though you feel quite over­\nwhelmed by the prospect? Or go to lunch early? \nThe best answer—which is to get started on that Over­\nwhelming A-l even with only a few minutes at your dis­\nposal—seem unrealistic, even meaningless. You may",

    "text": " well \ndecide to get a few easy C's out of the way instead. On the \nface of it, this does not seem to be a very serious breach of \ngood time-management practices, except that a person's day is \ntypically divided up into bits and pieces. Let's face it: Large \nblocks of uninterrupted time are a comparative rarity. If \nagain and again—a few minutes before lunch or before your \nchild returns from school—you choose to work on the easy C \n104 ALAN LAKEIN \nrather than to begin the difficult A-l, then you are procras­\ntinating; you're avoiding what is really important. \nIn most cases, when a person turns to the short and easy \nC, he does so precisely because it is short and easy. What you \nneed is some way to make the Overwhelming A-l competi­\ntive with the easy C. \nBut how? Let's say you have estimated that it'll take you \nfifty hours to formulate the budget, and you have only those \nten minutes available before lunch. The fact that you cannot \nfind anything like fifty hours today may well cause you to put \noff starting the project until tomorrow. But of course there \naren't fifty hours available the next day either, so you may \ndelay day after day until, with the deadline looming, you fi­\nnally make a frantic effort to get the job done—and probably \nnone too well, because you're in such a rush. \nThe key to getting an Overwhelming A-l under control is \nto get started on it as soon as you've identified it as the A-l \ntask. And an excellent way to get moving is to turn such an \nOverwhelming A-l into \"Swiss Cheese\" by poking some holes \nin it. I call these holes \"instant tasks.\" \nAn instant task requires five minutes or less of your time \nand makes some sort of hole in your Overwhelming A-l. So \nin ten minutes before lunch you have time for two instant \ntasks. To find out what the first two should be, (1) make a \nlist of possible instant tasks, and (2) set priorities. \nHere are some Swiss Cheese moves toward tackling the \nbudget problem: getting a copy of last year's budget, decid­\ning on the people you'll need to contact, obtaining the files \nyou'll need, arranging a meeting to discuss the budget, or \ngoing to lunch with a subordinate and turning over part of \nthe task (or all the preliminaries) to him. The only rule for \nmaking up your list of possible instant tasks is to limit it to \nitems that can be started quickly and easily and are in some \nway connected with working on the Overwhelming A-l. \nWhat Five Minutes Can Do \nThe underlying assumption of the Swiss Cheese approach is \nthat it is indeed possible to get something started in five min­\nutes or less. And once you've started, you've given yourself \nthe opportunity to keep going. For example, you may be­\ncome so interested in reading one of the files that you study \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 105 \nit for forty-five minutes before realizing how hungry you are. \nSwiss Cheese may well become your lunch—non-fattening \nbut eminently satisfying. \nIt's just as likely that you will start somewhere only to find \nthat it quickly leads to a dead end. You try to call someone \nto arrange a meeting on the budget for after lunch. He's not \navailable until tomorrow. So now you feel satisfied that \nyou've done your bit on that project for the day. You may \neven be glad to have failed in your first effort; it's such a \nconvenient excuse for further procrastination! That's an un­\npromising start Swiss Cheese is supposed to lead to involve­\nment. \nSo if that first effort failed, be patient for another moment. \nThink of a new instant task and give it a try. \nDon't try to bite the same hole out of the cheese twice. If \nyou've tried an instant task and it didn't lead to involvement, \nthe next step is to try another instant task right away. And \nremember: One hole does not make a piece of Swiss Cheese. \nIt may take a number of instant tasks before you finally get \ninvolved with the big A-l and gather the momentum needed \nto stay with it \nOne nice thing about the Swiss Cheese method is that it \ndoesn't really matter what instant task you select as long as \nit's (1) easy—the easier the better—and (2) related to the \nOverwhelming A-l. How much of a contribution a particular \ninstant task will make to getting your A-l done is far less im­\nportant than the overriding objective of the moment: To do \nsomething—anything—on the A-l.

On the \nface of it, this does not seem to be a very serious breach of \ngood time-management practices, except that a person's day is \ntypically divided up into bits and pieces. Let's face it: Large \nblocks of uninterrupted time are a comparative rarity. If \nagain and again—a few minutes before lunch or before your \nchild returns from school—you choose to work on the easy C \n104 ALAN LAKEIN \nrather than to begin the difficult A-l, then you are procras­\ntinating; you're avoiding what is really important. \nIn most cases, when a person turns to the short and easy \nC, he does so precisely because it is short and easy. What you \nneed is some way to make the Overwhelming A-l competi­\ntive with the easy C. \nBut how? Let's say you have estimated that it'll take you \nfifty hours to formulate the budget, and you have only those \nten minutes available before lunch. The fact that you cannot \nfind anything like fifty hours today may well cause you to put \noff starting the project until tomorrow. But of course there \naren't fifty hours available the next day either, so you may \ndelay day after day until, with the deadline looming, you fi­\nnally make a frantic effort to get the job done—and probably \nnone too well, because you're in such a rush. \nThe key to getting an Overwhelming A-l under control is \nto get started on it as soon as you've identified it as the A-l \ntask. And an excellent way to get moving is to turn such an \nOverwhelming A-l into \"Swiss Cheese\" by poking some holes \nin it. I call these holes \"instant tasks.\" \nAn instant task requires five minutes or less of your time \nand makes some sort of hole in your Overwhelming A-l. So \nin ten minutes before lunch you have time for two instant \ntasks. To find out what the first two should be, (1) make a \nlist of possible instant tasks, and (2) set priorities. \nHere are some Swiss Cheese moves toward tackling the \nbudget problem: getting a copy of last year's budget, decid­\ning on the people you'll need to contact, obtaining the files \nyou'll need, arranging a meeting to discuss the budget, or \ngoing to lunch with a",

The fact that you cannot \nfind anything like fifty hours today may well cause you to put \noff starting the project until tomorrow. But of course there \naren't fifty hours available the next day either, so you may \ndelay day after day until, with the deadline looming, you fi­\nnally make a frantic effort to get the job done—and probably \nnone too well, because you're in such a rush. \nThe key to getting an Overwhelming A-l under control is \nto get started on it as soon as you've identified it as the A-l \ntask. And an excellent way to get moving is to turn such an \nOverwhelming A-l into \"Swiss Cheese\" by poking some holes \nin it. I call these holes \"instant tasks.\" \nAn instant task requires five minutes or less of your time \nand makes some sort of hole in your Overwhelming A-l. So \nin ten minutes before lunch you have time for two instant \ntasks. To find out what the first two should be, (1) make a \nlist of possible instant tasks, and (2) set priorities. \nHere are some Swiss Cheese moves toward tackling",

The only rule for \nmaking up your list of possible instant tasks is to limit it to \nitems that can be started quickly and easily and are in some \nway connected with working on the Overwhelming A-l. \nWhat Five Minutes Can Do \nThe underlying assumption of the Swiss Cheese approach is \nthat it is indeed possible to get something started in five min­\nutes or less. And once you've started, you've given yourself \nthe opportunity to keep going. For example, you may be­\ncome so interested in reading one of the files that you study \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 105 \nit for forty-five minutes before realizing how hungry you are. \nSwiss Cheese may well become your lunch—non-fattening \nbut eminently satisfying. \nIt's just as likely that you will start somewhere only to find \nthat it quickly leads to a dead end. You try to call someone \nto arrange a meeting on the budget for after lunch. He's not \navailable until tomorrow. So now you feel satisfied that \nyou've done your bit on that project for the day. You may \neven be glad to have failed in your first effort; it's such a \nconvenient excuse for further procrastination! That's an un­\npromising start Swiss Cheese is supposed to lead to involve­\nment. \nSo if that first effort failed, be patient for another moment. \nThink of a new instant task and give it a try. \nDon't try to bite the same hole out of the cheese twice. If \nyou've tried an instant task and it didn't lead to involvement, \nthe next step is to try another instant task right away. And \nremember: One hole does not make a piece of Swiss Cheese. \nIt may take a number of instant tasks before you finally get \ninvolved with the big A-l and gather the momentum needed \nto stay with it \nOne nice thing about the Swiss Cheese method is that it \ndoesn't really matter what instant task you select as long as \nit's (1) easy—the easier the better—and (2) related to the \nOverwhelming A",

The only rule for \nmaking up your list of possible instant tasks is to limit it to \nitems that can be started quickly and easily and are in some \nway connected with working on the Overwhelming A-l. \nWhat Five Minutes Can Do \nThe underlying assumption of the Swiss Cheese approach is \nthat it is indeed possible to get something started in five min­\nutes or less. And once you've started, you've given yourself \nthe opportunity to keep going. For example, you may be­\ncome so interested in reading one of the files that you study \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 105 \nit for forty-five minutes before realizing how hungry you are. \nSwiss Cheese may well become your lunch—non-fattening \nbut eminently satisfying. \nIt's just as likely that you will start somewhere only to find \nthat it quickly leads to a dead end.",

You try to call someone \nto arrange a meeting on the budget for after lunch. He's not \navailable until tomorrow. So now you feel satisfied that \nyou've done your bit on that project for the day. You may \neven be glad to have failed in your first effort; it's such a \nconvenient excuse for further procrastination! That's an un­\npromising start Swiss Cheese is supposed to lead to involve­\nment. \nSo if that first effort failed, be patient for another moment. \nThink of a new instant task and give it a try. \nDon't try to bite the same hole out of the cheese twice. If \nyou've tried an instant task and it didn't lead to involvement, \nthe next step is to try another instant task right away. And \nremember: One hole does not make a piece of Swiss Cheese. \nIt may take a number of instant tasks before you finally get \ninvolved with the big A-l and gather the momentum needed \nto",

    "text": "-l. How much of a contribution a particular \ninstant task will make to getting your A-l done is far less im­\nportant than the overriding objective of the moment: To do \nsomething—anything—on the A-l. Whatever you choose, \nyou'll at least have begun. \nThe Swiss Cheese approach sometimes makes it possible to \nachieve surprising inroads even on a complex project. After \nyou've made ten or twelve holes in an Overwhelming A-l, \nyou may discover with delight that the task turns out to be \nmuch less difficult than you'd expected. Perhaps you've found \na way to turn over much of the project to someone else. Or \nyou've discovered an unsuspected short cut Or the job turns \nout to be easy and fun. Maybe all that was required was to \nbreak up the task into manageable bites; after you've done \nthis some jobs, like some jigsaw puzzles, are easily completed. \n106 ALAN LAKE IN \nMake A Last-Ditch Try \nIf you can't bring yourself to tackle the A-l, perhaps you \nshould compromise. Suppose you've managed so far today to \nescape from the A-l. Before you go on to other things, make \none last-ditch try at getting involved. Look at your watch and \nnote the time. Spend exactly five minutes on the A-l and \nthen stop for the day. Surely you can stand almost any task \nfor five minutes I \nPicture yourself on your summer vacation by the lake. \nYou've been lingering on the shore imagining how cold the \nwater must be. You ask some people standing at the water's \nedge, and they tell you that it's really cold. They've gone in, \nthough, and seem to have enjoyed it You'd like to try it, too, \nbut you're leery of the cold water. \nFinally, you walk to the end of the dock and put your big \ntoe into the water—it feels cold, all right. You put your \nwhole foot in—it feels colder. You sit down and painfully put \nboth feet into the water—it's colder still. You let your knees \nrelax, and the water comes up to your calves—it's painfully \ncold. \nThis bit-by-bit torture is getting you down, so you tell \nyourself youll quit in five minutes. You stand up. Should you \njump or dive in? You decide to jump in, swim the fifty feet \nto the float, swim back, and—if you aren't enjoying it by \nthen—climb out, dry yourself off, and play Ping-Pong. \nThere doesn't seem to be any right time to jump in. You \ndecide to count down from one hundred. One hundred, \nninety-nine, ninety-eight, . . . each number comes slower than \nthe one before it. Four, three, two, one, jump! You're in the \nwater and swimming toward the float. \nGo Ahead: Quit If You Must \nAn hour later you may still be in the water—if you de­\ncided you liked the exuberance of swimming and playing in \nthe chilly water. If you quit after five minutes you'll be wait­\ning your turn for a rematch with the Ping-Pong king. \nBack home the following week, you might wonder \nwhether you can use this \"quit in five minutes\" guarantee to \nstart exercising. Your doctor said you need more exercise. \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 107 \nYou've already bought the exercise manual, but the exercises \nlook too awful for words. Each morning during the two \nweeks before your vacation you got out of bed and groaned, \n\"No, not today. Maybe tomorrow.\" \nYou're tired of groaning and would like to be in better \nshape. You decide that surely you can take five minutes of \nexercise. You get the kitchen timer and set it for five min­\nutes. You open the manual and begin the exercises, keeping \none eye on the clock. As soon as it rings, you're saved by the \nbell from further exertion and you groan in relief. You \nhaven't given up groaning, but at least you've begun your ex­\nercise regime. Maybe the same trick will work again tomor­\nrow. Maybe you might gradually increase the time to six, \nseven, or possibly eight minutes. \nBack at work you find that you can use this \"quit in five \nminutes\" teaser to get yourself involved. You realize that you \nare delaying the A-l project because you fear the worst, but \nonce you get into it things will not be as awful as you imag­\nine them to be (isn't that often the case?). So you spend five \nminutes and do a little experimenting. You dip gingerly into \nsome aspect of the A-l. \nWhat did you learn? Was the A-l as unpleasant",

How much of a contribution a particular \ninstant task will make to getting your A-l done is far less im­\nportant than the overriding objective of the moment: To do \nsomething—anything—on the A-l. Whatever you choose, \nyou'll at least have begun. \nThe Swiss Cheese approach sometimes makes it possible to \nachieve surprising inroads even on a complex project. After \nyou've made ten or twelve holes in an Overwhelming A-l, \nyou may discover with delight that the task turns out to be \nmuch less difficult than you'd expected. Perhaps you've found \na way to turn over much of the project to someone else. Or \nyou've discovered an unsuspected short cut Or the job turns \nout to be easy and fun. Maybe all that was required was to \nbreak up the task into manageable bites; after you've done \nthis some jobs, like some jigsaw puzzles, are easily completed. \n106 ALAN LAKE IN \nMake A Last-Ditch Try \nIf you can't bring yourself to tackle the A-l, perhaps you \nshould compromise. Suppose you've managed so far today to \nescape from the A-l. Before you go on to other things, make \none last-ditch try at getting involved. Look at your watch and \nnote the time. Spend exactly five minutes on the A-l and \nthen stop for the day. Surely you can stand almost any task \nfor five minutes I \nPicture yourself on your summer vacation by the lake. \nYou've been lingering on the shore imagining how cold the \nwater must be. You ask some people standing at the water's \nedge, and they tell you that it's really cold. They've gone in, \nthough, and seem to have enjoyed it You'd like to try it, too, \nbut you're leery of the cold water. \nFinally, you walk to the end of the dock and put your big \ntoe into the water—it feels cold, all right. You put your \nwhole foot in—it feels colder. You sit down and painfully put \nboth feet into the water—it's colder still. You let your knees \nrelax, and the water comes up to your calves—it's painfully \ncold. \nThis bit-by-bit torture is getting you down, so you tell \nyourself youll quit in five minutes. You stand up. Should you \njump or dive in? You decide to jump in, swim the fifty feet \nto the float",

Before you go on to other things, make \none last-ditch try at getting involved. Look at your watch and \nnote the time. Spend exactly five minutes on the A-l and \nthen stop for the day. Surely you can stand almost any task \nfor five minutes I \nPicture yourself on your summer vacation by the lake. \nYou've been lingering on the shore imagining how cold the \nwater must be. You ask some people standing at the water's \nedge, and they tell you that it's really cold. They've gone in, \nthough, and seem to have enjoyed it You'd like to try it, too, \nbut you're leery of the cold water. \nFinally, you walk to the end of the dock and put your big \ntoe into the water—it feels cold, all right. You put your \nwhole foot in—it feels colder. You sit down and painfully put \nboth feet into the water—it's colder still. You let your knees \nrelax, and the water comes up to your calves—it's painfully \ncold.",

You decide to jump in, swim the fifty feet \nto the float, swim back, and—if you aren't enjoying it by \nthen—climb out, dry yourself off, and play Ping-Pong. \nThere doesn't seem to be any right time to jump in. You \ndecide to count down from one hundred. One hundred, \nninety-nine, ninety-eight, . . . each number comes slower than \nthe one before it. Four, three, two, one, jump! You're in the \nwater and swimming toward the float. \nGo Ahead: Quit If You Must \nAn hour later you may still be in the water—if you de­\ncided you liked the exuberance of swimming and playing in \nthe chilly water. If you quit after five minutes you'll be wait­\ning your turn for a rematch with the Ping-Pong king. \nBack home the following week, you might wonder \nwhether you can use this \"quit in five minutes\" guarantee to \nstart exercising. Your doctor said you need more exercise. \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 107 \nYou've already bought the exercise manual, but the exercises \nlook too awful for words. Each morning during the two \nweeks before your vacation you got out of bed and groaned, \n\"No, not today. Maybe tomorrow.\" \nYou're tired of groaning and would like to be in better \nshape. You decide that surely you can take five minutes of \nexercise. You get the kitchen timer and set it for five min­\nutes. You open the manual and begin the exercises, keeping \none eye on the clock. As soon as it rings, you're saved by the \nbell from further exertion and you groan in relief. You \nhaven't given up groaning, but at least you've begun your ex­\nercise regime. Maybe the same trick will work again tomor­\nrow. Maybe you might gradually increase the time to six, \nseven, or possibly eight minutes. \nBack at work you find that you can use this \"quit in five \nminutes\" teaser to get yourself involved. You realize that you \nare delaying the A-l project because you fear the worst, but \nonce you get into it things will not be as awful as you imag­\n",

You decide to jump in, swim the fifty feet \nto the float, swim back, and—if you aren't enjoying it by \nthen—climb out, dry yourself off, and play Ping-Pong. \nThere doesn't seem to be any right time to jump in. You \ndecide to count down from one hundred. One hundred, \nninety-nine, ninety-eight, . . . each number comes slower than \nthe one before it. Four, three, two, one, jump! You're in the \nwater and swimming toward the float. \nGo Ahead: Quit If You Must \nAn hour later you may still be in the water—if you de­\ncided you liked the exuberance of swimming and playing in \nthe chilly water. If you quit after five minutes you'll be wait­\ning your turn for a rematch with the Ping-Pong king. \nBack home the following week, you might wonder \nwhether you can use this \"quit in five minutes\" guarantee to \nstart exercising. Your doctor said you need more exercise. \nHOW",

Was the A-l as unpleasant as you \nimagined? Was it dull? Was it really all that overwhelming? \nWas it that difficult? Will it take that many hours? Isn't there \nany hope of success? \nYou can't expect to get too good an answer to all these \nquestions in just five minutes. And if you happen to forget \nabout them as your interest in the A-l increases, it really \ndoesn't matter. If this effort did not get you off and running \non the A-l, at least you know a little more than you did be­\nfore. Maybe your subconscious will help you come up with a \nfresh approach to the A-l tomorrow. And don't try to tell \nyourself that you would have spent all Wednesday afternoon \nworking on the A-l if you hadn't spent five minutes today \nand discovered how unpleasant it is! You know deep down \ninside that the first five minutes Wednesday would have been \nyour quota for the day. Now you can spend your second five \nminutes on it Wednesday—or perhaps the whole afternoon. \nAt other times you'll find, even after ten or twenty instant \ntasks, that you still have a complex and time-consuming proj­\nect ahead of you. You are unlikely to finish a twelve-hour \njob by working only in five-minute bites. You'll have to set \n108 ALAN LAKEIN \naside large blocks of time, hours or days, to complete it I \nsuggest you take your calendar and lay out a schedule of an \nhour a day, except for three hours each Tuesday and Thurs­\nday afternoon (or whatever) until the twelve hours have \nbeen reserved. Then let the logic of the task itself dictate \nsteps to keep it moving. \nThe instant tasks may not have gotten the project finished, \nbut they have led you to explore various aspects of it. You \nhave become involved in an interesting question here, a chal­\nlenging problem there. The project begins to exert a stronger \nand stronger pull. You become more eager to get back to it. \nYou've zeroed in on your target You're involved; you no \nlonger need the crutch of instant tasks. You have stopped \nprocrastinating. You're doing the A-11 \nThe method, I think you'll agree, sounds good. On the fol­\nlowing pages I'll describe a wide range of instant tasks— \nquick, easy ways to get started—that will not only aid in \neliminating procrastination, but will help break up any large \ntask into smaller, more do-able activities. \n15. HOW TO FIND INSTANT TASKS \nFOR INSTANT INVOLVEMENT \nDo More Detailed Planning \nSo YOU'RE HAVING TROUBLE getting involved in the A-l. \nAre you sure you've really drawn a bead on exactly what it is \nyou want to accomplish? If that's your trouble, you probably \nneed to do more detailed planning. As a general rule, the \nmore detailed the plan, the better the chance that action will \nfollow. And remember: Planning is really decision-making. \nFirst, I'm going to show you how to make some decisions \nto solidify your feelings about the A-l. \nTake a piece of paper and head it \"I have decided.\" You \nare now ready for five minutes of Decision Time. \nRecord on the paper whatever decisions come to your \nmind about the A-l. For instance: when to start it; what to \ndo first; what to do next; how much time you can devote to \nit all together; what information you need; what equipment is \nrequired; who else will be involved. The more concrete deci­\nsions you can make, the more likely it is you'll fix on some \nsimple but valuable ways to start on the A-l and get in­\nvolved. \nIf you run into snags doing this kind of detailed planning, I \nrecommend you try \"The Magic If.\" \nAdmit to yourself: \"I just cannot plan.\" Then say to your­\nself, \"But if I could plan, what would the plan be?\" Now, set \nabout to answer the if question. The beauty of the \"I can't \n. . . but if I could . . . question is that it temporarily frees you \nfrom all the limitations and problems you face. It unblocks \nthe planning muscles, as many of my clients have discovered. \nOr imagine this: You've been relieved of all responsibility \nfor getting a difficult A-l done. Instead, you only have to \nwrite down a plan for someone else to follow. You're simply \nto give this person whatever good advice you can, based on \nyour familiarity with",

Was the A-l as unpleasant as you \nimagined? Was it dull? Was it really all that overwhelming? \nWas it that difficult? Will it take that many hours? Isn't there \nany hope of success? \nYou can't expect to get too good an answer to all these \nquestions in just five minutes. And if you happen to forget \nabout them as your interest in the A-l increases, it really \ndoesn't matter. If this effort did not get you off and running \non the A-l, at least you know a little more than you did be­\nfore. Maybe your subconscious will help you come up with a \nfresh approach to the A-l tomorrow. And don't try to tell \nyourself that you would have spent all Wednesday afternoon \nworking on the A-l if you hadn't spent five minutes today \nand discovered how unpleasant it is! You know deep down \ninside that the first five minutes Wednesday would have been \nyour quota for the day. Now you can spend your second five \nminutes on it Wednesday—or perhaps the whole afternoon. \nAt other times you'll find, even after ten or twenty instant \ntasks, that you still have a complex and time-consuming proj­\nect ahead of you. You are unlikely to finish a twelve-hour \njob by working only in five-minute bites. You'll have to set \n108 ALAN LAKEIN \naside large blocks of time, hours or days, to complete it I \nsuggest you take your calendar and lay out a schedule of an \nhour a day, except for three hours each Tuesday and Thurs­\nday afternoon (or whatever) until the twelve hours have \nbeen reserved.

Was the A-l as unpleasant as you \nimagined? Was it dull? Was it really all that overwhelming? \nWas it that difficult? Will it take that many hours? Isn't there \nany hope of success? \nYou can't expect to get too good an answer to all these \nquestions in just five minutes. And if you happen to forget \nabout them as your interest in the A-l increases, it really \ndoesn't matter. If this effort did not get you off and running \non the A-l, at least you know a little more than you did be­\nfore. Maybe your subconscious will help you come up with a \nfresh approach to the A-l tomorrow. And don't try to tell \nyourself that you would have spent all Wednesday afternoon \nworking on the A-l if you hadn't spent five minutes today \nand discovered how unpleasant it is! You know deep down \ninside that the first five minutes Wednesday would have been \nyour quota for the day. Now you can spend your second five \nminutes on",

You're doing the A-11 \nThe method, I think you'll agree, sounds good. On the fol­\nlowing pages I'll describe a wide range of instant tasks— \nquick, easy ways to get started—that will not only aid in \neliminating procrastination, but will help break up any large \ntask into smaller, more do-able activities. \n15. HOW TO FIND INSTANT TASKS \nFOR INSTANT INVOLVEMENT \nDo More Detailed Planning \nSo YOU'RE HAVING TROUBLE getting involved in the A-l. \nAre you sure you've really drawn a bead on exactly what it is \nyou want to accomplish? If that's your trouble, you probably \nneed to do more detailed planning. As a general rule, the \nmore detailed the plan, the better the chance that action will \nfollow. And remember: Planning is really decision-making. \nFirst, I'm going to show you how to make some decisions \nto solidify your feelings about the A-l. \nTake a piece of paper and head it \"I have decided.\" You \nare now ready for five minutes of Decision Time. \nRecord on the paper whatever decisions come to your \nmind about the A-l. For instance: when to start it; what to \ndo first; what to do next; how much time you can devote to \nit all together; what information you need; what equipment is \nrequired; who else will be involved. The more concrete deci­\nsions you can make, the more likely it is you'll fix on some \nsimple but valuable ways to start on the A-l and get in­\nvolved. \nIf you run into snags doing this kind of detailed planning, I \nrecommend you try \"The Magic If.\" \nAdmit to yourself: \"I just cannot plan.\" Then say to your­\nself, \"But if I could plan, what would the plan be?\" Now, set \nabout to answer the if question. The beauty of the \"I can't \n. . . but if I could . . . question is that it temporarily frees you \nfrom all the limitations and problems you face. It unblocks \nthe planning muscles, as many of my clients have discovered. \nOr imagine this: You've been",

Once you've \n109 \n110 ALAN LAKEIN \nGet More Information \nSometimes I just can't get started on a project no matter \nhow hard I try. I once decided to lay a patio in my \nbackyard. But I knew nothing about the materials or tools I \nwas going to need. I never did start working on my patio. \nThis is a common chain, and a deadly one. You don't have \nthe information. You don't get really interested. You can't \nbecome involved. No action. \nThe old adage about familiarity breeding contempt is often \nuntrue. Non-familiarity often leads to lack of interest. I once \nread of an experiment with high school students who were \npresented with a list of forty-eight questions about inverte­\nbrate animals. The students were asked to indicate the twelve \nquestions to which they would most like to know the answers. \nSurprise! Questions about familiar animals were picked more \noften than questions about unfamiliar animals. \nIn another study, students were shown some unusual ob­\njects borrowed from museums. The experimenter went \nthrough the collection of objects three times, giving more in-prepared your plan, the entire burden of carrying out the \nplan will be shifted to his shoulders. You never have to do \nanything. Your only task is to plan how someone else should \ndo it. \nNow, what would you recommend to this person? Don't \nworry if some of the steps you recommend might be difficult \nfor you. The other fellow will be the one to do them—that is \nwhat he's there for. \nNext, put the written plan in the center of your desk and \ntake a break. Go to the water cooler. Talk with a friend. \nRelax. When you return to your desk, look at the written \nplan the other person is going to follow and see if there is \nanything you might do to help him out. You will probably \nfind there are steps within the plan involving work that you're \nparticularly good at or that you enjoy doing. Until the other \nfellow shows up, how about getting going on these preferred \nparts of the plan, just to start the A-l rolling? \nIt's a fact: not only can The Magic If make it possible for \nyou to plan what is to be done, it will often enable you to \nfollow through as well. \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LTFE 111 \nformation each time around. Whenever an object was present­\ned, the students were asked to indicate on a l-to-5 scale the \nextent to which they wanted to know more about it. There \nwas a significant tendency for more curiosity to be expressed \nwith each successive appearance of an object \nHere is experimental evidence that it takes at least a little \ninformation to generate an interest in something. The same is \ntrue in our everyday experience. Listener surveys of radio \nand TV news programs show that people who listen to the \nsix-o'clock news often listen to the 11 o'clock news as well. \nThe same people who listen to the news regularly are likely \nto read one or two newspapers seriously. Some information \nleads to eagerness for more. \nWho reads hobby magazines? People who already know \nsomething about the hobby. Whether it's model railroading, \nskiing, or gardening, most readers of such publications are \nregular readers eager for new ideas. Someone just glancing at \nsuch magazines on a newsstand may well wonder how anyone \ncould find them interesting. Lacking background knowledge \nand a frame of reference, they find the details meaningless. \nNot until a certain level of familiarity with a subject is \nreached are people likely to push toward a further explora­\ntion to satisfy the newly aroused curiosity. Once that level is \nreached, there is a good chance that involvement will in­\ncrease as knowledge accumulates—which is why getting more \ninformation is an instant task that leads to involvement. \nReading is one of the easiest instant tasks for most people. \nLooking at books, magazines, newspapers, internal reports, \nmemoirs, files, or letters for even a few minutes may stimu­\nlate your interest in a subject that you never much cared \nabout before—and it's leisurely activity that requires little en­\nergy. \nAnother good way to get more information is to talk to \npeople. People in your organization. In your neighborhood. \nIn your family. Talking is a pleasant way to get more in­\nformation about your A-l. \n112 ALAN LAKEIN \nTry a Leading Task \nWhen you really aren't quite up to",

But I knew nothing about the materials or tools I \nwas going to need. I never did start working on my patio. \nThis is a common chain, and a deadly one. You don't have \nthe information. You don't get really interested. You can't \nbecome involved. No action. \nThe old adage about familiarity breeding contempt is often \nuntrue. Non-familiarity often leads to lack of interest. I once \nread of an experiment with high school students who were \npresented with a list of forty-eight questions about inverte­\nbrate animals. The students were asked to indicate the twelve \nquestions to which they would most like to know the answers. \nSurprise! Questions about familiar animals were picked more \noften than questions about unfamiliar animals. \nIn another study, students were shown some unusual ob­\njects borrowed from museums. The experimenter went \nthrough the collection of objects three times, giving more in-prepared your plan, the entire burden of carrying out the \nplan will be shifted to his shoulders. You never have to do \nanything. Your only task is to plan how someone else should \ndo it. \nNow, what would you recommend to this person? Don't \nworry if some of the steps you recommend might be difficult \nfor you. The other fellow will be the one to do them—that is \nwhat he's there for. \nNext, put the written plan in the center of your desk and \ntake a break. Go to the water cooler. Talk with a friend. \nRelax. When you return to your desk, look at the written \nplan the other person is going to follow and see if there is \nanything you might do to help him out. You will probably \nfind there are steps within the plan involving work that you're \nparticularly good at or that you enjoy doing. Until the other \nfellow shows up, how about getting going on these preferred \nparts of the plan, just to start",

Until the other \nfellow shows up, how about getting going on these preferred \nparts of the plan, just to start the A-l rolling? \nIt's a fact: not only can The Magic If make it possible for \nyou to plan what is to be done, it will often enable you to \nfollow through as well. \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LTFE 111 \nformation each time around. Whenever an object was present­\ned, the students were asked to indicate on a l-to-5 scale the \nextent to which they wanted to know more about it. There \nwas a significant tendency for more curiosity to be expressed \nwith each successive appearance of an object \nHere is experimental evidence that it takes at least a little \ninformation to generate an interest in something. The same is \ntrue in our everyday experience. Listener surveys of radio \nand TV news programs show that people who listen to the \nsix-o'clock news often listen to the 11 o'clock news as well. \nThe same people who listen to the news regularly are likely \nto read one or two newspapers seriously. Some information \nleads to eagerness for more. \nWho reads hobby magazines? People who already know \nsomething about the hobby. Whether it's model railroading, \nskiing, or gardening, most readers of such publications are \nregular readers eager for new ideas. Someone just glancing at \nsuch magazines on a newsstand may well wonder how anyone \ncould find them interesting. Lacking background knowledge \nand a frame of reference, they find the details meaningless. \nNot until a certain level of familiarity with a subject is \nreached are people likely to push toward a further explora­\ntion to satisfy the newly aroused curiosity. Once that level is \nreached, there is a good chance that involvement will in­\ncrease as knowledge accumulates—which is why getting more \ninformation is an instant task that leads to involvement. \nReading is one of the easiest instant tasks for most people. \nLooking at books, magazines, newspapers, internal reports, \nmemoirs, files, or letters for even a few minutes may stimu­\nlate your interest in a subject that you never much cared \nabout before—and it's leisurely activity that requires little en­\nergy. \nAnother good way to get more information is to talk to \npeople.

    "text": " TV news programs show that people who listen to the \nsix-o'clock news often listen to the 11 o'clock news as well. \nThe same people who listen to the news regularly are likely \nto read one or two newspapers seriously. Some information \nleads to eagerness for more. \nWho reads hobby magazines? People who already know \nsomething about the hobby. Whether it's model railroading, \nskiing, or gardening, most readers of such publications are \nregular readers eager for new ideas. Someone just glancing at \nsuch magazines on a newsstand may well wonder how anyone \ncould find them interesting. Lacking background knowledge \nand a frame of reference, they find the details meaningless. \nNot until a certain level of familiarity with a subject is \nreached are people likely to push toward a further explora­\ntion to satisfy the newly aroused curiosity. Once that level is \nreached, there is a good chance that involvement will in­\ncrease as knowledge accumulates—which is why getting more \ninformation is an instant task that leads to involvement. \nReading is one of the easiest instant tasks for most people. \nLooking at books, magazines, newspapers, internal reports, \nmemoirs, files, or letters for even a few minutes",

    "text": " your organization. In your neighborhood. \nIn your family. Talking is a pleasant way to get more in­\nformation about your A-l. \n112 ALAN LAKEIN \nTry a Leading Task \nWhen you really aren't quite up to doing anything on your \nA-,1, but are not averse to getting ready to do something, \ntaking a physical step can often be a way of easing yourself \ngradually into the big job. I call this a \"leading task\" because \nit leads you on. \nAn obvious instant task to get you started on writing a re­\nport is to make some notes on the points to be covered. But \nsuppose even this seems too much to tackle. Try sharpening a \npencil. I'm not joking! Involvement will not necessarily ensue, \nbut at least there is a chance that, once you have the freshly \nsharpened pencil in your hand, you will let the pencil impel \nyou to write a few words of value before you put it down \nagain. \nThe physical presence of some item associated with your \nA-l can also be a compelling stimulus leading to involve­\nment. A good leading task is to move such an item to a con­\nspicuous place. You have a letter that you know you should \nanswer, but have been avoiding. Try putting it right in the \nmiddle of your desk. This increases the chance that sooner or \nlater you will pick it up and get started on a reply, perhaps \nwhen you are seeking diversion from some other task. An­\nother good leading task is to remove all distractions from \nyour desktop (such as expense accounts, cocktail-party invita­\ntions, or that copy of Playboy). Your chances that you will \nturn to the A-l will materially increase if it's the only item \nstaring you in the face. \nIf you really want to read War and Peace, but just don't \nseem to get around to it, here are some good leading tasks. \nBuy a copy. Take it off your bookshelf. Put it in your favor­\nite reading chair. Leave it lying around opened to page 1. \nShow it to a friend and say, \"I've finally started on this!\" \nPeople often tell me about some hobby they once enjoyed \nbut now only dream about. One man told me how much he \nregretted that he hadn't played tennis in five years. I learned \nthat his tennis racket was at the bottom of a storage chest, \nand that the only tennis balls he owned were old and had no \nbounce. No wonder playing tennis was just a dream for himl \nDoing a leading task would certainly increase this man's \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 113 \nchances of once again enjoying a game of tennis. He might \nhave his racket restrung. Or buy some new tennis balls. Or \nput all his equipment in the trunk of his car. If he still found \nhimself driving past an empty tennis court without stopping, \nhe could put his racket on the front seat so that he had to \nmove it to get into his car. With this constant stimulus—or \nirritant—as a reminder, if he's really serious about wanting \nto play tennis, hell eventually take his racket out of his car, \nand even hit a few balls. Whether hell remain involved is an­\nother matter—which we shall turn to later. In any case, he \nwill have gotten started and at least given himself the chance \nto continue. \nOne of my clients decided to wake up a little earlier each \nmorning to find time for a new interest. Setting his alarm \nahead half an hour did no good because he went right back \nto sleep. I suggested he try a leading task. He moved the \nalarm clock from beside his bed to the other side of his \nroom, right in front of the bathroom door. Getting up to \nturn off the alarm put him very close to the bathroom, so it \nrequired only a bit more effort to go to the sink and brush \nhis teeth. Having brushed his teeth, he was free to go back to \nsleep. He found, however, that if he could just manage to \nbrush his teeth, he was up to stay, because for years and \nyears he had made it a practice never to go back to bed after \nbrushing his teeth! \nMany of the most effective leading tasks take only a mo­\nment or two. We all know that there is often a very definite \nconnection between clenching one's jaw and being deter­\nmined; between leaning forward in a chair and being alert; be­\ntween taking a deep breath and relaxing. When you act to \nplace yourself within these patterns you can lead yourself on \nin the direction you want to go. Many of us do mis without \neven thinking about it. If you",

Talking is a pleasant way to get more in­\nformation about your A-l. \n112 ALAN LAKEIN \nTry a Leading Task \nWhen you really aren't quite up to doing anything on your \nA-,1, but are not averse to getting ready to do something, \ntaking a physical step can often be a way of easing yourself \ngradually into the big job. I call this a \"leading task\" because \nit leads you on. \nAn obvious instant task to get you started on writing a re­\nport is to make some notes on the points to be covered. But \nsuppose even this seems too much to tackle. Try sharpening a \npencil. I'm not joking! Involvement will not necessarily ensue, \nbut at least there is a chance that, once you have the freshly \nsharpened pencil in your hand, you will let the pencil impel \nyou to write a few words of value before you put it down \nagain. \nThe physical presence of some item associated with your \nA-l can also be a compelling stimulus leading to involve­\nment. A good leading task is to move such an item to a con­\nspicuous place. You have a letter that you know you should \nanswer, but have been avoiding. Try putting it right in the \nmiddle of your desk. This increases the chance that sooner or \nlater you will pick it up and get started on a reply, perhaps \nwhen you are seeking diversion from some other task. An­\nother good leading task is to remove all distractions from \nyour desktop (such as expense accounts, cocktail-party invita­\ntions, or that copy of Playboy). Your chances that you will \nturn to the A-l will materially increase if it's the only item \nstaring you in the face. \nIf you really want to read War and Peace, but just don't \nseem to get around to it, here are some good leading tasks. \nBuy a copy. Take it off your bookshelf. Put it in your favor­\nite reading chair. Leave it lying around opened to page 1. \nShow it to a friend and say, \"I've finally started on this!\" \nPeople often tell me about some hobby they once enjoyed \nbut now only dream about. One man told me how much he \nregretted that he hadn't played tennis in five years. I",

    "text": " say, \"I've finally started on this!\" \nPeople often tell me about some hobby they once enjoyed \nbut now only dream about. One man told me how much he \nregretted that he hadn't played tennis in five years. I learned \nthat his tennis racket was at the bottom of a storage chest, \nand that the only tennis balls he owned were old and had no \nbounce. No wonder playing tennis was just a dream for himl \nDoing a leading task would certainly increase this man's \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 113 \nchances of once again enjoying a game of tennis. He might \nhave his racket restrung. Or buy some new tennis balls. Or \nput all his equipment in the trunk of his car. If he still found \nhimself driving past an empty tennis court without stopping, \nhe could put his racket on the front seat so that he had to \nmove it to get into his car. With this constant stimulus—or \nirritant—as a reminder, if he's really serious about wanting \nto play tennis, hell eventually take his racket out of his car, \nand even hit a few balls. Whether hell remain involved is an­\nother matter—which we shall turn to later. In any case, he \nwill have gotten started and at least given himself the chance \nto continue. \nOne of my clients decided to wake up a little earlier each \nmorning to find time for a new interest. Setting his alarm \nahead half an hour did no good because he went right back \nto sleep. I suggested he try a leading task. He moved the \nalarm clock from beside his bed to the other side of his \nroom, right in front of the bathroom door. Getting up to \nturn off the alarm put him very close to the bathroom, so it \nrequired only a bit more effort to go to the sink and brush \nhis teeth. Having brushed his teeth, he was free to go back to \nsleep. He found, however, that if he could just manage to \nbrush his teeth, he was up to stay, because for years and \nyears he had made it a practice never to go back to bed after \nbrushing his teeth! \nMany of the most effective leading tasks take only a mo­\nment or two. We all know that there is often a very definite \nconnection between clenching one's jaw and being deter­\nmined; between leaning forward in a chair and being alert;",

One man told me how much he \nregretted that he hadn't played tennis in five years. I learned \nthat his tennis racket was at the bottom of a storage chest, \nand that the only tennis balls he owned were old and had no \nbounce. No wonder playing tennis was just a dream for himl \nDoing a leading task would certainly increase this man's \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 113 \nchances of once again enjoying a game of tennis. He might \nhave his racket restrung. Or buy some new tennis balls. Or \nput all his equipment in the trunk of his car. If he still found \nhimself driving past an empty tennis court without stopping, \nhe could put his racket on the front seat so that he had to \nmove it to get into his car. With this constant stimulus—or \nirritant—as a reminder, if he's really serious about wanting \nto play tennis, hell eventually take his racket out of his car, \nand even hit a few balls. Whether hell remain involved is an­\nother matter—which we shall turn to",

Whether hell remain involved is an­\nother matter—which we shall turn to later. In any case, he \nwill have gotten started and at least given himself the chance \nto continue. \nOne of my clients decided to wake up a little earlier each \nmorning to find time for a new interest. Setting his alarm \nahead half an hour did no good because he went right back \nto sleep. I suggested he try a leading task. He moved the \nalarm clock from beside his bed to the other side of his \nroom, right in front of the bathroom door. Getting up to \nturn off the alarm put him very close to the bathroom, so it \nrequired only a bit more effort to go to the sink and brush \nhis teeth. Having brushed his teeth, he was free to go back to \nsleep. He found, however, that if he could just manage to \nbrush his teeth, he was up to stay, because for years and \nyears he had made it a practice never to go back to bed after \nbrushing his teeth! \nMany of the most",

Consciously look for opportunities to use these kinds \nof physical actions to help you do what you want, and you'll \nfind them. \nStill another useful leading task is to \"select the right chan­\nnel.\" That is: If you have nothing to say, at least turn your \nmind toward the outlet that you'd use if you were full of \nideas. If you must type something, turn on the typewriter. \n114 ALAN LAKEIN \nTitle a page something like \"I can't think of anything to \ntype.\" Then pour out your soul to the typewriter—type any­\nthing that goes through your mind, anything at all. After \ndoing this for a while, your mind may be jogged so you're \nready to put a fresh piece of paper in the typewriter and \nstart typing something connected with the A-l. \nIf you need to dictate, turn on your dictation machine and \nkeep it on even if you don't have anything to say. Gradually, \nthe running dictation belt may start to pull you along, almost \nforcing you to find something to say. Once the words have \nbegun to flow, you can direct them toward the A-l. If you \ndo not turn on your dictation machine until you have pre­\ncisely the \"right thing\" to say, you may never get started. \nIf you are having trouble making an important telephone \ncall, pick up the phone and call a friend. Try to explain to \nyour friend that it's impossible for you to pick up the \nphone, dial the numbers, say hello, and talk to this other per­\nson. But wait! You've just done it. If you can do it once, you \ncan do it again and make that A-l call. \nLeading yourself toward the A-l in this way will not al­\nways work. But I have observed many times that a simple \nphysical action does indeed lead to meaningful involvement \nTake Advantage of Your Current Mood \nOne reason why people have difficulty getting involved in \ntheir A-l is that it often requires doing something they're not \nemotionally prepared to do. Perhaps getting started on your \nA-l means sitting quietly at your desk thinking, when what \nyou really feel like doing is talking to someone. Now you \nhave two options: To forget all about your decision to get \nstarted on the A-l and talk to someone just for the sake of \ntalking, or to take advantage of your mood by letting it carry \nyou toward the A-l, rather than away from it \nThe idea is to take your emotional need and see whether it \nis possible to satisfy it in some way connected with the A-l. \nIn the example I just gave, clearly the best use of your time \nwould be to go to talk to someone who is concerned with \nyour A-l and see what ideas he or she can share with you. \nAfter satisfying your need for companionship, and hopefully \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LD7B 115 \ngetting some good ideas in the bargain, you may find it much \neasier to return to your desk and do the required thinking. \nThe reverse twist of this—leading to procrastination rather \nthan forward movement—happens daily in most stock-\nbrokerage offices. Many people become stockbrokers in part \nbecause of a wish to associate with (and help) other people. \nRationally, this could be satisfied by calling on prospects and \ncustomers and attempting to sell stocks. This need can also \nbe satisfied by talking to other stockbrokers. Besides, stock­\nbrokers are handier, and known for their friendliness; pros­\npects are more difficult to reach, and occasionally of less \nfriendly bent \nThat is why many stockbrokers use up much valuable time \nby selling other brokers on their views about sports, politics \nand women. \nAt times everybody likes to be left alone to shuffle papers \nquietly. This is a legitimate emotional need, often satisfied by \nprocessing routine paperwork, emptying the in-box, or neat-\nening a pile of more or less useless memos. If you detect that \nyou're avoiding your A-l because of this need, you may be \nable to satisfy it and still do something for the A-l. You \ncould arrange all your papers connected with the A-l in al­\nphabetical order, dot all the i's and cross all the t's, make neat \nlists of things to do on",

Many of us do mis without \neven thinking about it. If you look directly at a speaker, \nyou're more likely to listen to him. If you stand up and \nstretch during an evening's reading, you are less likely to fall \nasleep. Consciously look for opportunities to use these kinds \nof physical actions to help you do what you want, and you'll \nfind them. \nStill another useful leading task is to \"select the right chan­\nnel.\" That is: If you have nothing to say, at least turn your \nmind toward the outlet that you'd use if you were full of \nideas.

After \ndoing this for a while, your mind may be jogged so you're \nready to put a fresh piece of paper in the typewriter and \nstart typing something connected with the A-l. \nIf you need to dictate, turn on your dictation machine and \nkeep it on even if you don't have anything to say. Gradually, \nthe running dictation belt may start to pull you along, almost \nforcing you to find something to say. Once the words have \nbegun to flow, you can direct them toward the A-l. If you \ndo not turn on your dictation machine until you have pre­\ncisely the \"right thing\" to say, you may never get started. \nIf you are having trouble making an important telephone \ncall, pick up the phone and call a friend. Try to explain to \nyour friend that it's impossible for you to pick up the \nphone, dial the numbers, say hello, and talk to this other per­\nson. But wait! You've just done it. If you can do it once, you \ncan do it again and make that A-l call. \nLeading yourself toward the A-l in this way will not al­\nways work.

If you stand up and \nstretch during an evening's reading, you are less likely to fall \nasleep. Consciously look for opportunities to use these kinds \nof physical actions to help you do what you want, and you'll \nfind them. \nStill another useful leading task is to \"select the right chan­\nnel.\" That is: If you have nothing to say, at least turn your \nmind toward the outlet that you'd use if you were full of \nideas. If you must type something, turn on the typewriter. \n114 ALAN LAKEIN \nTitle a page something like \"I can't think of anything to \ntype.\" Then pour out your soul to the typewriter—type any­\nthing that goes through your mind, anything at all. After \ndoing this for a while, your mind may be jogged so you're \nready to put a fresh piece of paper in the typewriter",

After \ndoing this for a while, your mind may be jogged so you're \nready to put a fresh piece of paper in the typewriter and \nstart typing something connected with the A-l. \nIf you need to dictate, turn on your dictation machine and \nkeep it on even if you don't have anything to say. Gradually, \nthe running dictation belt may start to pull you along, almost \nforcing you to find something to say. Once the words have \nbegun to flow, you can direct them toward the A-l. If you \ndo not turn on your dictation machine until you have pre­\ncisely the \"right thing\" to say, you may never get started. \nIf you are having trouble making an important telephone \ncall, pick up the phone and call a friend. Try to explain to \nyour friend that it's impossible for you to pick up the \nphone, dial the numbers, say hello, and talk to this other per­\nson. But wait! You've just done it. If you can do it once, you \ncan do it again and make that A-l call. \n",

    "text": "Leading yourself toward the A-l in this way will not al­\nways work. But I have observed many times that a simple \nphysical action does indeed lead to meaningful involvement \nTake Advantage of Your Current Mood \nOne reason why people have difficulty getting involved in \ntheir A-l is that it often requires doing something they're not \nemotionally prepared to do. Perhaps getting started on your \nA-l means sitting quietly at your desk thinking, when what \nyou really feel like doing is talking to someone. Now you \nhave two options: To forget all about your decision to get \nstarted on the A-l and talk to someone just for the sake of \ntalking, or to take advantage of your mood by letting it carry \nyou toward the A-l, rather than away from it \nThe idea is to take your emotional need and see whether it \nis possible to satisfy it in some way connected with the A-l. \nIn the example I just gave, clearly the best use of your time \nwould be to go to talk to someone who is concerned with \nyour A-l and see what ideas he or she can share with you. \nAfter satisfying your need for companionship, and hopefully \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LD7B 115 \ngetting some good ideas in the bargain, you may find it much \neasier to return to your desk and do the required thinking. \nThe reverse twist of this—leading to procrastination rather \nthan forward movement—happens daily in most stock-\nbrokerage offices. Many people become stockbrokers in part \nbecause of a wish to associate with (and help) other people. \nRationally, this could be satisfied by calling on prospects and \ncustomers and attempting to sell stocks. This need can also \nbe satisfied by talking to other stockbrokers. Besides, stock­\nbrokers are handier, and known for their friendliness; pros­\npects are more difficult to reach, and occasionally of less \nfriendly bent \nThat is why many stockbrokers use up much valuable time \nby selling other brokers on their views about sports, politics \nand women. \nAt times everybody likes to be left alone to shuffle papers \nquietly. This is a legitimate emotional need, often satisfied by \nprocessing routine paperwork, emptying the in-box, or neat-\nening a pile of more or less useless memos. If you detect that \nyou're avoiding your A-l because of this need, you may be \nable to satisfy it",

Many people become stockbrokers in part \nbecause of a wish to associate with (and help) other people. \nRationally, this could be satisfied by calling on prospects and \ncustomers and attempting to sell stocks. This need can also \nbe satisfied by talking to other stockbrokers. Besides, stock­\nbrokers are handier, and known for their friendliness; pros­\npects are more difficult to reach, and occasionally of less \nfriendly bent \nThat is why many stockbrokers use up much valuable time \nby selling other brokers on their views about sports, politics \nand women. \nAt times everybody likes to be left alone to shuffle papers \nquietly. This is a legitimate emotional need, often satisfied",

    "text": " and still do something for the A-l. You \ncould arrange all your papers connected with the A-l in al­\nphabetical order, dot all the i's and cross all the t's, make neat \nlists of things to do on the A-l (without any feeling of ever \nhaving to do them), or rewrite a memo about the A-l even \nthough the memo really needs no further polishing. \nYou might well ask me at this point, \"Aren't I better off \ndoing something worthwhile that is not connected with the \nA-l rather than doing something trivial on the A-l?\" \nMy emphatic answer to this question is \"Nol\" \nIf you tell me you've been procrastinating and are not able \nto get involved in the A-l, do anything, regardless of impor­\ntance, so long as it has some connection with the A-l. Once \nyou're involved, your sense of priorities will lead you eventu­\nally to do more productive work on the A-l. But if you turn \nto some other activity, you've done nothing to try to halt the \nprocrastination mechanism, and you've given yourself no \nchance to become involved. \nSometimes it's best to wait until your mood is right for \ndoing something. You don't want to use up too much energy \ntrying to force yourself to do something that you don't want \nto do. But often—especially if the task you have identified as \n116 ALAN LAKEIN \nyour A-l is fairly complex and involves a number of steps— \nthere is an excellent chance that at least one particular aspect \nof the project will fit your current mood. Your job is to find \nthat soft spot \nA good question to ask yourself at this point is \"What am \nI willing to do on the A-l?\" You might say to yourself, \"I \nknow there are plenty of things about this A-l that I don't \nfeel like doing now, but is there anything I find interesting, or \nappealing, or at least tolerable?\" \nFind some piece of the A-l that you're in the mood to do. \nThen you will be using your existing needs to lead you \ntoward the A-l rather than letting them lead you away from \nit. \nSay you're writing a book. At this moment you're not in­\nterested in rewriting any of the dozen chapters that will have \nto be completely reworked. You do feel like reading the edi­\ntor's comments on those chapters that are in pretty good \nshape, and that require little effort on your part to finish up. \nOr you face a big exam. You're not quite ready to read \nthe supplementary textbooks that the professor has assigned. \nBut you don't mind reading over your class notes, something \nyou know you're going to have to do anyway in the course of \npreparing for the test \nGive Yourself a Pep Talk \nPerhaps your lack of involvement is due to a lack of mo­\ntivation. In that case, taking a few minutes to build up mo­\ntivation is a good investment. \nStudies have shown that most people don't start a project \nthey believe they can't finish. Conversely, most people will at­\ntempt something that appears easy even though in fact it is \nimpossible. The basis of their willingness to try is their sub­\njective estimate of the probability of success. \nSo remember: If you feel that something will be difficult \nor impossible, the odds are that you'll not be as likely to try \nit as if you feel it is easy. But keep in mind that these are \nyour feelings. They aren't necessarily facts. Since you don't \nfor a fact know how hard something is, you'll do better to as­\nsume that it's not too difficult and that you can do it. This is \nmuch more likely to get you started on the A-l. It stands to \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LD7E 117 \nreason: If you think you're going to be successful, you'll \nwork harder on getting the A-l finished—which is why a lit­\ntle pep talk about positive attitude and self-confidence can \nmotivate you to do the A-l. lust as the coach talks to the \nfootball team at halftime, you might try telling yourself: \n\"You can do it. So stay with it\" \n\"Stop feeling sorry for yourself and get to workP \n\"You'll never know until you try.\" \n\"We don't want any defeatists around here.\" \nThese slogans will help fight discouragement and negative \nfeelings. \nYour pep talk might also include a listing of the benefits \n(see Learn to Stress the Benefits, Chapter 20) that you'll \nreap from getting the A-l done, and yes, the consequences \nthat face you if you fail to do it now.

You \ncould arrange all your papers connected with the A-l in al­\nphabetical order, dot all the i's and cross all the t's, make neat \nlists of things to do on the A-l (without any feeling of ever \nhaving to do them), or rewrite a memo about the A-l even \nthough the memo really needs no further polishing. \nYou might well ask me at this point, \"Aren't I better off \ndoing something worthwhile that is not connected with the \nA-l rather than doing something trivial on the A-l?\" \nMy emphatic answer to this question is \"Nol\" \nIf you tell me you've been procrastinating and are not able \nto get involved in the A-l, do anything, regardless of impor­\ntance, so long as it has some connection with the A-l. Once \nyou're involved, your sense of priorities will lead you eventu­\nally to do more productive work on the A-l. But if you turn \nto some other activity, you've done nothing to try to halt the \nprocrastination mechanism, and you've given yourself no \nchance to become involved. \nSometimes it's best to wait until your mood is right for \ndoing something. You don't want to use up too much energy \ntrying to force yourself to do something that you don't want \nto do. But often—especially if the task you have identified as \n116 ALAN LAKEIN \nyour A-l is fairly complex and involves a number of steps— \nthere is an excellent chance that at least one particular aspect \nof the project will fit your current mood. Your job is to find \nthat soft spot \nA good question to ask yourself at this point is \"What am \nI willing to do on the A-l?\" You might say to yourself, \"I \nknow there are plenty of things about this A-l that I don't \nfeel like doing now, but is there anything I find interesting, or \nappealing, or at least tolerable?\" \nFind some piece of the A-l that you're in the mood to do. \nThen you will be using your existing needs to lead you \ntoward the A-l rather than letting them lead you away from \nit. \nSay you're writing a book. At this moment you're not in­\nterested in rewriting any of the dozen chapters that will have \nto be completely reworked. You",

At this moment you're not in­\nterested in rewriting any of the dozen chapters that will have \nto be completely reworked. You do feel like reading the edi­\ntor's comments on those chapters that are in pretty good \nshape, and that require little effort on your part to finish up. \nOr you face a big exam. You're not quite ready to read \nthe supplementary textbooks that the professor has assigned. \nBut you don't mind reading over your class notes, something \nyou know you're going to have to do anyway in the course of \npreparing for the test \nGive Yourself a Pep Talk \nPerhaps your lack of involvement is due to a lack of mo­\ntivation. In that case, taking a few minutes to build up mo­\ntivation is a good investment. \nStudies have shown that most people don't start a project \nthey believe they can't finish. Conversely, most people will at­\ntempt something that appears easy even though in fact it is \nimpossible. The basis of their willingness to try is their sub­\njective estimate of the probability of success. \nSo remember: If you feel that something will be difficult \nor impossible, the odds are that you'll not be as likely to try \nit as if you feel it is easy. But keep in mind that these are \nyour feelings. They aren't necessarily facts. Since you don't \nfor a fact know how hard something is, you'll do better to as­\nsume that it's not too difficult and that you can do it. This is \nmuch more likely to get you started on the A-l.

So stay with it\" \n\"Stop feeling sorry for yourself and get to workP \n\"You'll never know until you try.\" \n\"We don't want any defeatists around here.\" \nThese slogans will help fight discouragement and negative \nfeelings. \nYour pep talk might also include a listing of",

(See The Real Price \nOf Delay, Chapter 19). \nMake a Commitment to Someone \nYou tell yourself, \"I'll spend an hour on this in the after­\nnoon,\" but the time comes and goes and you work on other \nmatters. But if you have actually made an appointment with \nsomeone else to discuss the subject, you're likely to keep the \nappointment and get the subject discussed, because you've \nmade a commitment to someone and don't want to let that \nperson down. I find that some clients use an appointment \nwith me as the stimulus to get going on some A-l they feel is \nimportant. They don't want to let me down, and they don't \nwant to waste the fee they're paying me. They've made a \ncommitment in self-esteem and money, and these are power­\nful stimuli indeed. \nWhat can you promise, and who is a good promisee? Well, \nyou can promise your husband to get the garden in shape in \ntime for the backyard barbeque he has arranged; promise \nyour wife, as she leaves for the office in the morning, that \nyou'll make a souffl6 for dinner tonight; promise your boss \nthat you'll have the proposal ready for his review on his return \nfrom his Toledo trip. Usually this kind of promise activates \nyour conscience sufficiently to get the A-l done. \nA deadline, though often unpleasant, also seems to force \naction. A promise to meet a deadline rather than do it \"later\" \n118 ALAN LAKEIN \nis a good inducement If friends invite you to \"get together \nsometime\" you may well want to leave things deliberately \nvague. But if you really enjoy their company, don't let them \nget away without setting a definite time for getting together. \nA meeting is a special kind of deadline. A commitment to \nbe a particular place at a specific time to discuss a particular \nsubject goes a long way to get a task moving. Your un­\nwillingness to be totally unprepared at the meeting forces \nyour hand. You do some preparation, and this represents \nmore involvement than you've mustered up to now. \nMeetings are one of the greatest time-wasters ever invent­\ned. They are almost always inefficient. Much of what is said \nat meetings is irrelevant or redundant. Little is to the point. \nBut what do you expect? If the guy who called the meeting \nknew all the answers, or could just go ahead and do what \nneeded doing, he wouldn't have called the meeting in the first \nplace. \nMost meetings come about because someone cannot do the \nA-l easily or by himself. Rather than leaving important prob­\nlems totally unattended to, the executive committee of the \nSupergiant Corporation of the membership committee of the \nYMCA gets everyone together and at least gets someone \nthinking about the A-l problem. It might be an instant task to \ncall a meeting, but it's hardly an instant task to attend it As \nI've shown, you can usually do a lot better yourself. \n16. TRY STIMULUS CHANGE TO \nKEEP INVOLVED \nONCE YOU GET INVOLVED, many tasks keep you involved \nuntil the end. You may put off cleaning up after a dinner \nparty for several hours, but once you do begin—washing the \ndishes, cleaning the ashtrays, vacuuming the rug—you perse­\nvere until the job is done. Or, having put aside a couple of \nhours of quiet time, you^spread across your desk all the ho­\ntel, airline, and rent-a-car receipts from a long business trip \nand keep at it until you have filled out all the necessary ex­\npense account forms so your office will reimburse you. \nMost tasks are sufficiently short or compelling so that even \nif you must put them aside and come back to them later, \nyour initial involvement carries you quickly back to the heart \nof the project, just as a good book pulls at you again and \nagain until you have read the last page. \nAt other times you work on a task for a while, but you \nrun out of steam short of your goal. Perhaps you've been sit­\nting at your desk working on the proposal for a new televi­\nsion documentary for an hour and a half, and can't come up \nwith another decent idea. Or you've been addressing enve­\nlopes for a charity benefit; you have to finish by 5 P.M. but \nhalfway through you just can't stand to look at another zip \ncode. \nYou know that the best use of",

(See The Real Price \nOf Delay, Chapter 19). \nMake a Commitment to Someone \nYou tell yourself, \"I'll spend an hour on this in the after­\nnoon,\" but the time comes and goes and you work on other \nmatters. But if you have actually made an appointment with \nsomeone else to discuss the subject, you're likely to keep the \nappointment and get the subject discussed, because you've \nmade a commitment to someone and don't want to let that \nperson down. I find that some clients use an appointment \nwith me as the stimulus to get going on some A-l they feel is \nimportant. They don't want to let me down, and they don't \nwant to waste the fee they're paying me. They've made a \ncommitment in self-esteem and money, and these are power­\nful stimuli indeed. \nWhat can you promise, and who is a good promisee? Well, \nyou can promise your husband to get the garden in shape in \ntime for the backyard barbeque he has arranged; promise \nyour wife, as she leaves for the office in the morning, that \nyou'll make a souffl6 for dinner tonight; promise your boss \nthat you'll have the proposal ready for his review on his return \nfrom his Toledo trip. Usually this kind of promise activates \nyour conscience sufficiently to get the A-l done. \nA deadline, though often unpleasant, also seems to force \naction. A promise to meet a deadline rather than do it \"later\" \n118 ALAN LAKEIN \nis a good inducement If friends invite you to \"get together \nsometime\" you may well want to leave things deliberately \nvague. But if you really enjoy their company, don't let them \nget away without setting a definite time for getting together. \nA meeting is a special kind of deadline. A commitment to \nbe a particular place at a specific time to discuss a particular \nsubject goes a long way to get a task moving. Your un­\nwillingness to be totally unprepared at the meeting forces \nyour hand. You do some preparation, and this represents \nmore involvement than you've mustered up to now. \nMeetings are one of the greatest time",

But if you have actually made an appointment with \nsomeone else to discuss the subject, you're likely to keep the \nappointment and get the subject discussed, because you've \nmade a commitment to someone and don't want to let that \nperson down. I find that some clients use an appointment \nwith me as the stimulus to get going on some A-l they feel is \nimportant. They don't want to let me down, and they don't \nwant to waste the fee they're paying me. They've made a \ncommitment in self-esteem and money, and these are power­\nful stimuli indeed. \nWhat can you promise, and who is a good promisee?

Well, \nyou can promise your husband to get the garden in shape in \ntime for the backyard barbeque he has arranged; promise \nyour wife, as she leaves for the office in the morning, that \nyou'll make a souffl6 for dinner tonight; promise your boss \nthat you'll have the proposal ready for his review on his return \nfrom his Toledo trip. Usually this kind of promise activates \nyour conscience sufficiently to get the A-l done. \nA deadline, though often unpleasant, also seems to force \naction. A promise to meet a deadline rather than do it \"later\" \n118 ALAN LAKEIN \nis a good inducement If friends invite you to \"get together \nsometime\" you may well want to leave things deliberately \nvague. But if you really enjoy their company, don't let them \nget away without setting a definite time for getting together. \nA meeting is a special kind of deadline. A commitment to \nbe a particular place at a specific time to discuss a particular \nsubject goes a long way to get a task moving",

    "text": ". Your un­\nwillingness to be totally unprepared at the meeting forces \nyour hand. You do some preparation, and this represents \nmore involvement than you've mustered up to now. \nMeetings are one of the greatest time-wasters ever invent­\ned. They are almost always inefficient. Much of what is said \nat meetings is irrelevant or redundant. Little is to the point. \nBut what do you expect? If the guy who called the meeting \nknew all the answers, or could just go ahead and do what \nneeded doing, he wouldn't have called the meeting in the first \nplace. \nMost meetings come about because someone cannot do the \nA-l easily or by himself. Rather than leaving important prob­\nlems totally unattended to, the executive committee of the \nSupergiant Corporation of the membership committee of the \nYMCA gets everyone together and at least gets someone \nthinking about the A-l problem. It might be an instant task to \ncall a meeting, but it's hardly an instant task to attend it As \nI've shown, you can usually do a lot better yourself. \n16. TRY STIMULUS CHANGE TO \nKEEP INVOLVED \nONCE YOU GET INVOLVED, many tasks keep you involved \nuntil the end. You may put off cleaning up after a dinner \nparty for several hours, but once you do begin—washing the \ndishes, cleaning the ashtrays, vacuuming the rug—you perse­\nvere until the job is done. Or, having put aside a couple of \nhours of quiet time, you^spread across your desk all the ho­\ntel, airline, and rent-a-car receipts from a long business trip \nand keep at it until you have filled out all the necessary ex­\npense account forms so your office will reimburse you. \nMost tasks are sufficiently short or compelling so that even \nif you must put them aside and come back to them later, \nyour initial involvement carries you quickly back to the heart \nof the project, just as a good book pulls at you again and \nagain until you have read the last page. \nAt other times you work on a task for a while, but you \nrun out of steam short of your goal. Perhaps you've been sit­\nting at your desk working on the proposal for a new televi­\nsion documentary for an hour and a half, and can't come up \nwith another decent idea. Or you",

You do some preparation, and this represents \nmore involvement than you've mustered up to now. \nMeetings are one of the greatest time-wasters ever invent­\ned. They are almost always inefficient. Much of what is said \nat meetings is irrelevant or redundant. Little is to the point. \nBut what do you expect? If the guy who called the meeting \nknew all the answers, or could just go ahead and do what \nneeded doing, he wouldn't have called the meeting in the first \nplace. \nMost meetings come about because someone cannot do the \nA-l easily or by himself. Rather than leaving important prob­\nlems totally unattended to, the executive committee of the \nSupergiant Corporation of the membership committee of the \nYMCA gets everyone together and at least gets someone \nthinking about the A-l problem. It might be an instant task to \ncall a meeting, but it's hardly an instant task to attend it As \nI've shown, you can usually do a lot better yourself. \n16. TRY STIMULUS CHANGE TO \nKEEP INVOLVED \nONCE YOU GET INVOLVED,",

You may put off cleaning up after a dinner \nparty for several hours, but once you do begin—washing the \ndishes, cleaning the ashtrays, vacuuming the rug—you perse­\nvere until the job is done. Or, having put aside a couple of \nhours of quiet time, you^spread across your desk all the ho­\ntel, airline, and rent-a-car receipts from a long business trip \nand keep at it until you have filled out all the necessary ex­\npense account forms so your office will reimburse you. \nMost tasks are sufficiently short or compelling so that even \nif you must put them aside and come back to them later, \nyour initial involvement carries you quickly back to the heart \nof the project, just as a good book pulls at you again and \nagain until you have read the last page. \nAt other times you work on a task for a while, but you \nrun out of steam short",

    "text": "'ve been addressing enve­\nlopes for a charity benefit; you have to finish by 5 P.M. but \nhalfway through you just can't stand to look at another zip \ncode. \nYou know that the best use of your time is to continue with \nthe A-l. You have told yourself that this is no time for pro­\ncrastination. You managed to get involved. You built up \nquite a bit of momentum. But now you're bogged down. \nHow you can possibly stay involved any longer? \nOne answer is: Always set a next step. Quite frequently, a \nproject will bog down for lack of planning the very next step. \nWhenever you are working your way through a project, \nmake clear what the next step is. Then set a time to check \nwhether you've completed that step. \n119 \n120 ALAN LAKE IN \nNo Need to Become Bored \nIt's not at all surprising that you should become bored, \nrestless, or fatigued after working on the same task for some \ntime. The yearning for change is natural. Variety is not \nmerely \"the spice of life\"; it's an essential ingredient. \nVarious experiments have been carried out in which an in­\ndividual is placed in a room with a strictly controlled envi­\nronment. His responses are monitored. In one of these exper­\niments the subject lies on a comfortable bed in total darkness \nmost of the time. All his physical needs are cared for. He \npushes a button and finds a hot meal behind a sliding panel. \nAfter five days of this, most of the test subjects reported \nhysteria, fantasies, and delusions. No subject was able to \ncontinue for more than a week, and all took many months to \nrecuperate fully. Such experiments confirm that in the ab­\nsence of what is called \"stimulus change\" a person undergoes \nrapid psychological deterioration. \nIf stimulus change is a fundamental human need, this need \nmay go back to the way our ancestors lived. The caveman's \nlife depended on his ability to detect and respond to change. \nA shift in the scent carried on the wind alerted him to the \npresence of food and the danger of predatory animals. Sur­\nvival of the fittest favored those who were most sensitive to \nstimulus change. Modern man has inherited this biological ra­\ndar. \nBut if it once was a matter of life and death to be aware \nof a sound of the advancing mammoth's footsteps, today it is \ngenerally annoying and distracting to be turned into the noise \nof strangers walking down the hall, other people's telephones \nringing, and cars passing by. \nPotentially distracting stimuli are always around although \nwhen you're very much engrossed in something, you may not \nnotice them or can ignore them. Constructive stimuli some­\ntimes need an invitation. \nNormally your need for stimulus change is satisfied by the \nevolution of the current task as one step leads to another. \nThe natural evolution of a project generates many possible \ntasks. Keeping a To Do List gives you a choice of tasks to \nprovide stimulus change. It even pays occasionally to take \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 121 \ntime to list additional steps you might take on the A-l just so \nyou have a broader range of activities to draw upon. \nIt's when the current task does not provide variety and \nchange of pace that you grow restless or bored and eagerly \naccept distraction or create it for yourself. Is there any alter­\nnative to procrastination at this point? \nSuppressing your need for change is very unlikely to be a \nsatisfactory way of staying involved in the A-l when you feel \nlike you've had enough; you can't change the biologically in­\nstilled need for stimulus change. If you're going to get con­\ntrol of your actions, your opportunity comes in providing the \nright stimulus change. \nRest Breaks and Work Breaks \nOne thing you can do is take a rest break. Get up and \nstretch, walk to the water cooler, socialize, then continue on \nthe A-l for another hour or two. \nYou can also take a work break. Any other task will do, \nbut another A is always preferable if it will mean a change \nof pace from the work you were just involved in. If you've \nbeen addressing envelopes, make an appointment with your \nhairdresser, go over your dinner menu, wash the breakfast \ndishes, or visit with the woman next door. Then, after a few \nminutes, go back and continue the A-l. \nOften the break is all you need. But what do you do if \nyou're working against a deadline and every minute counts? \nOr if you tried a coffee break ten minutes ago and you're al",

You have told yourself that this is no time for pro­\ncrastination. You managed to get involved. You built up \nquite a bit of momentum. But now you're bogged down. \nHow you can possibly stay involved any longer? \nOne answer is: Always set a next step. Quite frequently, a \nproject will bog down for lack of planning the very next step. \nWhenever you are working your way through a project, \nmake clear what the next step is. Then set a time to check \nwhether you've completed that step. \n119 \n120 ALAN LAKE IN \nNo Need to Become Bored \nIt's not at all surprising that you should become bored, \nrestless, or fatigued after working on the same task for some \ntime. The yearning for change is natural. Variety is not \nmerely \"the spice of life\"; it's an essential ingredient. \nVarious experiments have been carried out in which an in­\ndividual is placed in a room with a strictly controlled envi­\nronment. His responses are monitored. In one of these exper­\niments the subject lies on a comfortable bed in total darkness \nmost of the time. All his physical needs are cared for. He \npushes a button and finds a hot meal behind a sliding panel. \nAfter five days of this, most of the test subjects reported \nhysteria, fantasies, and delusions. No subject was able to \ncontinue for more than a week, and all took many months to \nrecuperate fully. Such experiments confirm that in the ab­\nsence of what is called \"stimulus change\" a person undergoes \nrapid psychological deterioration. \nIf stimulus change is a fundamental human need, this need \nmay go back to the way our ancestors lived. The caveman's \nlife depended on his ability to detect and respond to change. \nA shift in the scent carried on the wind alerted him to the \npresence of food and the danger of predatory animals. Sur­\nvival of the fittest favored those who were most sensitive to \nstimulus change. Modern man has inherited this biological ra­\ndar. \nBut if it once was",

Modern man has inherited this biological ra­\ndar. \nBut if it once was a matter of life and death to be aware \nof a sound of the advancing mammoth's footsteps, today it is \ngenerally annoying and distracting to be turned into the noise \nof strangers walking down the hall, other people's telephones \nringing, and cars passing by. \nPotentially distracting stimuli are always around although \nwhen you're very much engrossed in something, you may not \nnotice them or can ignore them. Constructive stimuli some­\ntimes need an invitation. \nNormally your need for stimulus change is satisfied by the \nevolution of the current task as one step leads to another. \nThe natural evolution of a project generates many possible \ntasks. Keeping a To Do List gives you a choice of tasks to \nprovide stimulus change. It even pays occasionally to take \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 121 \ntime to list additional steps you might take on the A-l just so \nyou have a broader range of activities to draw upon. \nIt's when the current task does not provide variety and \nchange of pace that you grow restless or bored and eagerly \naccept distraction or create it for yourself. Is there any alter­\nnative to procrastination at this point? \nSuppressing your need for change is very unlikely to be a \nsatisfactory way of staying involved in the A-l when you feel \nlike you've had enough; you can't change the biologically in­\nstilled need for stimulus change. If you're going to get con­\ntrol of your actions, your opportunity comes in providing the \nright stimulus change. \nRest Breaks and Work Breaks \nOne thing you can do is take a rest break. Get up and \nstretch, walk to the water cooler, socialize, then continue on \nthe A-l for another hour or two. \nYou can also take a work break. Any other task will do, \nbut another A is always preferable if it will mean a change \nof pace from the work you were just involved in. If you've \nbeen addressing envelopes, make an appointment with your \nhairdresser, go over your dinner menu, wash the breakfast \ndishes, or visit with the woman next door. Then, after a few \nminutes,",

Is there any alter­\nnative to procrastination at this point? \nSuppressing your need for change is very unlikely to be a \nsatisfactory way of staying involved in the A-l when you feel \nlike you've had enough; you can't change the biologically in­\nstilled need for stimulus change. If you're going to get con­\ntrol of your actions, your opportunity comes in providing the \nright stimulus change. \nRest Breaks and Work Breaks \nOne thing you can do is take a rest break. Get up and \nstretch, walk to the water cooler, socialize, then continue on \nthe A-l for another hour or two. \nYou can also take a work break. Any other task will do, \nbut another A is always preferable if it will mean a change \nof pace from the work you were just",

    "text": " go back and continue the A-l. \nOften the break is all you need. But what do you do if \nyou're working against a deadline and every minute counts? \nOr if you tried a coffee break ten minutes ago and you're al­\nready becoming restive again? You might leave the A-l for a \nwhile, but is that wise? Won't you have the same problem of \nreinvolvement when you try to return to it later? \nYou really want to stick to it, but how? \nThe answer lies in satisfying your need for stimulus change \nwithin the scope of the A-l. \nTasks that you find dull and repetitive can—with some \nimagination—be made more interesting. Even if you're send­\ning out Christmas cards, sewing name tapes on camp clothes, \nor coding inventory sheets, if you look you will find ways \nto vary such tasks and satisfy your need for stimulus change \nwithout running away to some other activity. \nThe real payoff in using this technique comes when you're \n122 ALAN LAKE IN \nhaving trouble staying involved in a multifaeeted project, ,like \nwriting a magazine article, developing a study proposal for \nthe League of Women Voters, figuring out how to respond to \na competitor's new product, or researching ways to recycle \nused plasterboard. To keep from procrastinating when you \nget bogged down in a swampy part of the forest, you need to \nget hooked on some new aspect of the project. You need \nfresh bait for fresh involvement. \nAs I showed in the section on instant tasks, there are many \nways to move your project ahead. You can plan, talk to oth­\ners, give yourself a pep talk, gather information, write down \nsome notes. Naturally, some projects have more built-in vari­\nety than others. But there are always at least some opportu­\nnities for change within each project. \nTry changing your location. Sometimes new surroundings \ncan do wonders to refresh a tired mind. If you've been work­\ning at your desk, try the conference room. If you've been \nreading in the living room, try the bedroom. Or stay where \nyou are but change your position. If you have been sitting \ndown, try standing on your head. \nWhat works best is to change the way you're going about \nthe task. Any intellectual effort contains elements that can be \njuggled. You need information and ideas. These have to be \ncollected, digested, and acted upon. You can shift back and \nforth between working on information and ideas, or switch \nfrom collecting to digesting to action. \nNot Enough Information—or Too Mnch? \nLet's begin with information collection. Earlier I discussed \nthe idea of getting more information as a way to get in­\nvolved. You will recall that the level of your interest gener­\nally increases as you move from no information to some \ninformation. So when you need to keep involved in a project, \npick an area where you have little or no information and in­\ncrease your- knowledge. \nBut suppose your problem is the very opposite. Many \npeople get bogged down in the middle of a project because \nthey have so much information that they feel overwhelmed. \nOr they have too many ideas (even too many good ones). \nThere is an optimum level of knowledge of course (it varies \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LD7E 123 \nfor different projects and for different people). Either too \nmuch or too little leads to a decrease in interest and involve­\nment. \nSo if you are tired of collecting information or ideas, proc­\ness what you have. Consider each item; then file it, condense \nit, throw it out, organize it A particularly helpful step, if \nyou've been gathering knowledge from books or other people \nor your own head, is to write something down. Even if it is \nno good for final use, it gives you something fresh to react \nto, or to show others to get their reactions. \nThe Cushion That Never Got Made \nMs. Gill had long wanted to make a needlepoint cushion \nfor a favorite chair. She kept putting it off, because there \nseemed to be so many details to work out before she could \neven begin to think of putting needle to canvas. Finally, \nwisely realizing she would have to start somewhere if she was \ngoing to get on with it, she went shopping for materials. She \nspent several weeks looking for the perfect pattern and yarns. \nA saleslady at one store talked her into taking a month-long \nintensive course on the history and technology of needlepoint. \nHaving completed the course, she decided that the only way \nto have yarns of the precise colors she wanted was to get \nthem from a mail-order house. This led to a six-week delay \n",

But what do you do if \nyou're working against a deadline and every minute counts? \nOr if you tried a coffee break ten minutes ago and you're al­\nready becoming restive again? You might leave the A-l for a \nwhile, but is that wise? Won't you have the same problem of \nreinvolvement when you try to return to it later? \nYou really want to stick to it, but how? \nThe answer lies in satisfying your need for stimulus change \nwithin the scope of the A-l. \nTasks that you find dull and repetitive can—with some \nimagination—be made more interesting. Even if you're send­\ning out Christmas cards, sewing name tapes on camp clothes, \nor coding inventory sheets, if you look you will find ways \nto vary such tasks and satisfy your need for stimulus change \nwithout running away to some other activity. \nThe real payoff in using this technique comes when you're \n122 ALAN LAKE IN \nhaving trouble staying involved in a multifaeeted project, ,like \nwriting a magazine article, developing a study proposal for \nthe League of Women Voters, figuring out how to respond to \na competitor's new product, or researching ways to recycle \nused plasterboard.

You need \nfresh bait for fresh involvement. \nAs I showed in the section on instant tasks, there are many \nways to move your project ahead. You can plan, talk to oth­\ners, give yourself a pep talk, gather information, write down \nsome notes. Naturally, some projects have more built-in vari­\nety than others. But there are always at least some opportu­\nnities for change within each project. \nTry changing your location. Sometimes new surroundings \ncan do wonders to refresh a tired mind. If you've been work­\ning at your desk, try the conference room. If you've been \nreading in the living room, try the bedroom. Or stay where \nyou are but change your position. If you have been sitting \ndown, try standing on your head. \nWhat works best is to change the way you're going about \nthe task. Any intellectual effort contains elements that can be \njuggled.

Any intellectual effort contains elements that can be \njuggled. You need information and ideas. These have to be \ncollected, digested, and acted upon. You can shift back and \nforth between working on information and ideas, or switch \nfrom collecting to digesting to action. \nNot Enough Information—or Too Mnch? \nLet's begin with information collection. Earlier I discussed \nthe idea of getting more information as a way to get in­\nvolved. You will recall that the level of your interest gener­\nally increases as you move from no information to some \ninformation. So when you need to keep involved in a project, \npick an area where you have little or no information and in­\ncrease your- knowledge. \nBut suppose your problem is the very opposite. Many \npeople get bogged down in the middle of a project because \nthey have so much information that they feel overwhelmed. \nOr they have too many ideas (even too many good ones). \nThere is an optimum level of knowledge of course (it varies \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LD7E 123 \nfor different projects and for different people). Either too \nmuch or too little leads to a decrease in interest and involve­\nment. \nSo if you are tired of collecting information or ideas, proc­\ness what you have. Consider each item; then file it, condense \nit, throw it out, organize it A particularly helpful step, if \nyou've been gathering knowledge from books or other people \nor your own head, is to write something down. Even if it is \nno good for final use, it gives you something fresh to react \nto, or to show others to get their reactions. \nThe Cushion That Never Got Made \nMs. Gill had long wanted to make a needlepoint cushion \nfor a favorite chair. She kept putting it off, because there \nseemed to be so many details to work out before she could \neven begin to think of putting needle to canvas. Finally, \nwisely realizing she would have to start somewhere if she was \ngoing to get on with it, she went shopping for materials. She \nspent several weeks looking for the perfect pattern and yarns. \nA saleslady at one store talked her into taking a month-long \nintensive course on",

    "text": " the history and technology of needlepoint. \nHaving completed the course, she decided that the only way \nto have yarns of the precise colors she wanted was to get \nthem from a mail-order house. This led to a six-week delay \nwhile she inquired about samples, received some, asked for \nmore, received those, and finally made her choice. \nThen, having assembled her materials, she realized she did \nnot have the right place to work on her needlepoint project. \nSo she decided to fix up the spare room, change the lighting \nfixtures, clean out the accumulation of old junk, etc. Another \nmonth went by. Then she asked her husband to make her a \nspecial box for her supplies, since she did not like any of the \ntypes she saw in the stores. Another two-week delay. When \nat long last she had taken care of every conceivable detail, \neliminated all risk of error or inconvenience, and laid every­\nthing out in great orderliness, she had become so sick of the \nwhole thing that she thought she had best delay a while be­\nfore starting. \nThe moral of the story is: You can become so carried \naway with preparatory steps that you beat any project to \ndeath. I said before that any task is acceptable as a stimulus \n124 ALAN LAKE IN \nchange so long as it bears some relation to the Overwhelming \nA-l. But it must also be relatively short and easy. It must \nlead you toward the completion of the A-l. If Ms. Gill's A-l \nwas to turn loose her curiosity about needlepoint and follow \nwherever it led, then she accomplished her A-l in fine style. \nBut if it was to make a new cushion for her chair, then she \ncertainly went astray. \nAny major project, such as adding a new wing to your \nhouse, or introducing an important new procedure in your \noffice, is a prolonged effort that requires continuing involve­\nment at many stages. This takes large blocks of time. \nFirst schedule the time needed to work on the project: \nThen when the time comes use the ideas in this chapter to \nkeep involved. \n17. SOMETIMES IT PAYS TO SLOW DOWN \nIN SOME SITUATIONS, such techniques as instant tasks and \nstimulus change will not halt procrastination, because you \nharbor a too-active dislike or distaste for the A-l. Talking to \nyour child's teacher about a bad grade, seeing the doctor for \nan annual checkup, asking the bank for a loan, drawing up a \nnew will, going for a job interview—these are all examples of \nimportant but unpleasant tasks that many people put off. You \nprobably include them when you plan, and underscore their \nimportance by assigning them an A-priority. But when the \ntime comes to follow through, the task looms up larger than \nlife in all its unpleasantness, and you hastily turn to some \nother activity instead. \nA decision to turn from an unpleasant A-l to a more \npleasant task gets far less time and rational consideration \nthan it deserves. Typically, such a decision is made quickly, \noften in a matter of a few seconds. \nSuppose you take out a letter you should answer now. \nWriting a reply is your A-l, but since it involves admitting an \nembarrassing mistake you find the task distasteful. You lay \nthe letter aside for the third time this week and pick up a \nmagazine instead. Soon you're absorbed in an interesting arti­\ncle, and have forgotten all about the unpleasant letter. The \nsequence of steps that led to your procrastinating on the A-l \ntook no more than fifteen seconds. \nLet's back up and look at that decision more closely. You \nalready had a clearly identified A-l. The next step was to do \nit But you hesitated. In essence, you had two choices at this \npoint. You could. \n(1) do the A-l, thereby making the best use of your time; \n(2) do something else, thereby wasting your time. \nTrue, you got some value out of the activity you turned to \ninstead of the A-l, but since the A-l was the best use of your \ntime, the other activity was a comparative waste of time. \n125 \n126 ALAN LAKEIN \nWhat can you do when you have no doubt that you should \ndo the unpleasant A-l, yet are strongly inclined to run away \nfrom it and turn to something else? \nFirst, you must recognize clearly when you have reached \nsuch a pivotal point You're at Decision Time when you're at \nthe point of choosing whether to do the A-l now or to avoid \nit. It is somewhat like being at the top of a mountain. There \nare two paths leading down the mountain, one to the north \nand one to",

This led to a six-week delay \nwhile she inquired about samples, received some, asked for \nmore, received those, and finally made her choice. \nThen, having assembled her materials, she realized she did \nnot have the right place to work on her needlepoint project. \nSo she decided to fix up the spare room, change the lighting \nfixtures, clean out the accumulation of old junk, etc. Another \nmonth went by. Then she asked her husband to make her a \nspecial box for her supplies, since she did not like any of the \ntypes she saw in the stores. Another two-week delay. When \nat long last she had taken care of every conceivable detail, \neliminated all risk of error or inconvenience, and laid every­\nthing out in great orderliness, she had become so sick of the \nwhole thing that she thought she had best delay a while be­\nfore starting. \nThe moral of the story is: You can become so carried \naway with preparatory steps that you beat any project to \ndeath. I said before that any task is acceptable as a stimulus \n124 ALAN LAKE IN \nchange so long as it bears some relation to the Overwhelming \nA-l. But it must also be relatively short and easy. It must \nlead you toward the completion of the A-l. If Ms. Gill's A-l \nwas to turn loose her curiosity about needlepoint and follow \nwherever it led, then she accomplished her A-l in fine style. \nBut if it was to make a new cushion for her chair, then she \ncertainly went astray. \nAny major project, such as adding a new wing to your \nhouse, or introducing an important new procedure in your \noffice, is a prolonged effort that requires continuing involve­\nment at many stages. This takes large blocks of time. \nFirst schedule the time needed to work on the project: \nThen when the time comes use the ideas in this chapter to \nkeep involved. \n17. SOMETIMES IT PAYS TO SLOW DOWN \nIN SOME SITUATIONS, such techniques as instant tasks and \nstimulus change will not halt procrastination, because you \nharbor a too-active dislike or distaste for the A-l.

This led to a six-week delay \nwhile she inquired about samples, received some, asked for \nmore, received those, and finally made her choice. \nThen, having assembled her materials, she realized she did \nnot have the right place to work on her needlepoint project. \nSo she decided to fix up the spare room, change the lighting \nfixtures, clean out the accumulation of old junk, etc. Another \nmonth went by. Then she asked her husband to make her a \nspecial box for her supplies, since she did not like any of the \ntypes she saw in the stores. Another two-week delay. When \nat long last she had taken care of every conceivable detail, \neliminated all risk of error or inconvenience, and laid every­\nthing out in great orderliness, she had become so sick of the \nwhole thing that she thought she had best delay a while be­\nfore starting. \nThe moral of the story is: You can become so carried \naway with preparatory steps that you beat any project to",

I said before that any task is acceptable as a stimulus \n124 ALAN LAKE IN \nchange so long as it bears some relation to the Overwhelming \nA-l. But it must also be relatively short and easy. It must \nlead you toward the completion of the A-l. If Ms. Gill's A-l \nwas to turn loose her curiosity about needlepoint and follow \nwherever it led, then she accomplished her A-l in fine style. \nBut if it was to make a new cushion for her chair, then she \ncertainly went astray. \nAny major project, such as adding a new wing to your \nhouse, or introducing an important new procedure in your \noffice, is a prolonged effort that requires continuing involve­\nment at many stages. This takes large blocks of time. \nFirst schedule the time needed to work on the project: \nThen when the time comes use the ideas in this chapter to \nkeep involved. \n17. SOMETIMES IT",

    "text": " PAYS TO SLOW DOWN \nIN SOME SITUATIONS, such techniques as instant tasks and \nstimulus change will not halt procrastination, because you \nharbor a too-active dislike or distaste for the A-l. Talking to \nyour child's teacher about a bad grade, seeing the doctor for \nan annual checkup, asking the bank for a loan, drawing up a \nnew will, going for a job interview—these are all examples of \nimportant but unpleasant tasks that many people put off. You \nprobably include them when you plan, and underscore their \nimportance by assigning them an A-priority. But when the \ntime comes to follow through, the task looms up larger than \nlife in all its unpleasantness, and you hastily turn to some \nother activity instead. \nA decision to turn from an unpleasant A-l to a more \npleasant task gets far less time and rational consideration \nthan it deserves. Typically, such a decision is made quickly, \noften in a matter of a few seconds. \nSuppose you take out a letter you should answer now. \nWriting a reply is your A-l, but since it involves admitting an \nembarrassing mistake you find the task distasteful. You lay \nthe letter aside for the third time this week and pick up a \nmagazine instead. Soon you're absorbed in an interesting arti­\ncle, and have forgotten all about the unpleasant letter. The \nsequence of steps that led to your procrastinating on the A-l \ntook no more than fifteen seconds. \nLet's back up and look at that decision more closely. You \nalready had a clearly identified A-l. The next step was to do \nit But you hesitated. In essence, you had two choices at this \npoint. You could. \n(1) do the A-l, thereby making the best use of your time; \n(2) do something else, thereby wasting your time. \nTrue, you got some value out of the activity you turned to \ninstead of the A-l, but since the A-l was the best use of your \ntime, the other activity was a comparative waste of time. \n125 \n126 ALAN LAKEIN \nWhat can you do when you have no doubt that you should \ndo the unpleasant A-l, yet are strongly inclined to run away \nfrom it and turn to something else? \nFirst, you must recognize clearly when you have reached \nsuch a pivotal point You're at Decision Time when you",

Talking to \nyour child's teacher about a bad grade, seeing the doctor for \nan annual checkup, asking the bank for a loan, drawing up a \nnew will, going for a job interview—these are all examples of \nimportant but unpleasant tasks that many people put off. You \nprobably include them when you plan, and underscore their \nimportance by assigning them an A-priority. But when the \ntime comes to follow through, the task looms up larger than \nlife in all its unpleasantness, and you hastily turn to some \nother activity instead. \nA decision to turn from an unpleasant A-l to a more \npleasant task gets far less time and rational consideration \nthan it deserves. Typically, such a decision is made quickly, \noften in a matter of a few seconds. \nSuppose you take out a letter you should answer now. \nWriting a reply is your A-l, but since it involves admitting an \nembarrassing mistake you find the task distasteful. You lay \nthe letter",

You lay \nthe letter aside for the third time this week and pick up a \nmagazine instead. Soon you're absorbed in an interesting arti­\ncle, and have forgotten all about the unpleasant letter. The \nsequence of steps that led to your procrastinating on the A-l \ntook no more than fifteen seconds. \nLet's back up and look at that decision more closely. You \nalready had a clearly identified A-l. The next step was to do \nit But you hesitated. In essence, you had two choices at this \npoint. You could. \n(1) do the A-l, thereby making the best use of your time; \n(2) do something else, thereby wasting your time. \nTrue, you got some value out of the activity you turned to \ninstead of the A-l, but since the A-l was the best use of your \ntime, the other activity was a comparative waste of time. \n125 \n126 ALAN LAKEIN \nWhat can you do when you have no",

    "text": "'re at \nthe point of choosing whether to do the A-l now or to avoid \nit. It is somewhat like being at the top of a mountain. There \nare two paths leading down the mountain, one to the north \nand one to the south. Once you take a few steps you will be \non your way down one side of the mountain. But for the mo­\nment you are poised at the top, uncommitted. \nOnce you realize you're at Decision Time, you'll want to \ntake control of the decisionmaking process. The way to do \nthis is to slow down the final decision. A quick decision to \nput the unpleasant A-l out of sight and mind gives you little \nchance to curb your tendency to procrastinate. Take enough \ntime to consider the situation carefully. Give yourself every \nopportunity not to ditch the A-l for some activity of lesser \nvalue. Slow down the process so that you have time to make \na conscious and deliberate choice. \nTake the case of the unanswered letter. When you catch \nyourself putting the letter aside, slow your hand down. If you \ntake a full minute to put the letter away, instead of the sec­\nond or two you would normally take, you'll be forced to con­\nfront your thoughts about the letter. You'll have enough time \nto review why you've been putting the letter aside, and try to \ncome up with a better way to solve your dilemma than by \nprocrastination. \nHave you ever done anything you didn't like? Of course \nyou have. Everyone has. In childhood your parents insisted \nthat you go to bed at 7:30 P.M., even though it was summer \nvacation and the older kids were still outside playing Hide-\nand-Seek. On April 15 you mailed your income-tax check to \nUncle Sam, even though you would rather have used the \nmoney to buy a four-track stereo for the den. You studied \nfor an exam coming up in a subject you loathe. The list is \nendless. \nEven as you do something you don't like, you have a \nchoice. You can do it grudgingly or, having decided to do it \nnow, you can do it cheerfully. Why make yourself miser­\nable? Once you've decided to do a task, you may as well do \nthe best you can and try to enjoy yourself. \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LD7E 127 \nIf you sense you're about to avoid the A-l and do some­\nthing else instead, tell yourself quite emphatically that you're \nat Decision Time. Remind yourself what an important time it \nis. Caution yourself to slow down. Now use these three ways \nto help you overcome your distaste for the A-l: \n(1) Deal with the unpleasantness directly. \n(2) Recognize the greater unpleasantness that results from \ndelay. \n(3) Create enthusiasm that counterbalances the unpleas­\nantness. \nI'll deal with each of these in detail. Once you have all \nthree in your toolkit, you can use whichever seems most ap­\npropriate to give you the extra push you need at Decision \nTime for doing the A-l now. \n18. DON'T LET FEAR GET IN YOUR WAY \nHow MANY, TIMES have you avoided doing something im­\nportant because you were afraid of making a mistake? Or \ngetting angry? Or feeling guilty? Or hurting yourself or oth­\ners? Or being rejected? Or taking on too much responsibility? \nOr confronting the unknown? Lots of times, I'm sure. \nI'm not a psychiatrist, so it would be presumptuous of me \nto make any diagnosis, especially at long distance, of any­\none's particular emotional hang-up. The techniques I discuss \nin mis chapter work in a bypass fashion; they are not intend­\ned to cure anyone of any particular emotional problem, but \nto allow him to function while he either works his problem \nout himself or gets professional help. \nm deal primarily with fear, because my conversations with \npsychiatrists and psychologists have convinced me that fear is \nat the root of all avoidance. If you can conquer your fear, \nyou can do that unpleasant A-l. \nI have encountered many cases of people avoiding a task \nto which they have assigned a high priority because subcon­\nsciously they feared the consequences that would follow once \nthe task was completed. \nThe sales executive mentioned earlier kept procrastinating \non his A-l of trying to sell a new account because of his fear \nof adding further to his workload if he were successful. His \nfear needed to be allayed by clearing away some of bis other \nwork; only then did he stop avoiding his high-priority A and \ngo after that big account \nA supervisor was asked to develop a procedure manual for",

There \nare two paths leading down the mountain, one to the north \nand one to the south. Once you take a few steps you will be \non your way down one side of the mountain. But for the mo­\nment you are poised at the top, uncommitted. \nOnce you realize you're at Decision Time, you'll want to \ntake control of the decisionmaking process. The way to do \nthis is to slow down the final decision. A quick decision to \nput the unpleasant A-l out of sight and mind gives you little \nchance to curb your tendency to procrastinate. Take enough \ntime to consider the situation carefully. Give yourself every \nopportunity not to ditch the A-l for some activity of lesser \nvalue. Slow down the process so that you have time to make \na conscious and deliberate choice. \nTake the case of the unanswered letter. When you catch \nyourself putting the letter aside, slow your hand down. If you \ntake a full minute to put the letter away, instead of the sec­\nond or two you would normally take, you'll be forced to con­\nfront your thoughts about the letter. You'll have enough time \nto review why you've been putting the letter aside, and try to \ncome up with a better way to solve your dilemma than by \nprocrastination. \nHave you ever done anything you didn't like? Of course \nyou have. Everyone has. In childhood your parents insisted \nthat you go to bed at 7:30 P.M., even though it was summer \nvacation and the older kids were still outside playing Hide-\nand-Seek. On April 15 you mailed your income-tax check to \nUncle Sam, even though you would rather have used the \nmoney to buy a four-track stereo for the den. You studied \nfor an exam coming up in a subject you loathe. The list is \nendless. \nEven as you do something you don't like, you have a \nchoice. You can do it grudgingly or, having decided to do it \nnow, you can do it cheerfully. Why make yourself miser­\nable? Once you've decided to do a task, you may as well do \nthe best you can and try to enjoy yourself. \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR",

There \nare two paths leading down the mountain, one to the north \nand one to the south. Once you take a few steps you will be \non your way down one side of the mountain. But for the mo­\nment you are poised at the top, uncommitted. \nOnce you realize you're at Decision Time, you'll want to \ntake control of the decisionmaking process. The way to do \nthis is to slow down the final decision. A quick decision to \nput the unpleasant A-l out of sight and mind gives you little \nchance to curb your tendency to procrastinate. Take enough \ntime to consider the situation carefully. Give yourself every \nopportunity not to ditch the A-l for some activity of lesser \nvalue. Slow down the process so that you have time to make \na conscious and deliberate choice. \nTake the case of the unanswered letter. When you catch \nyourself putting the letter aside, slow your hand down. If you \ntake a full minute to put the letter away, instead of the sec­\nond or two you would normally take,",

You studied \nfor an exam coming up in a subject you loathe. The list is \nendless. \nEven as you do something you don't like, you have a \nchoice.

Once you've decided to do a task, you may as well do \nthe best you can and try to enjoy yourself. \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LD7E 127 \nIf you sense you're about to avoid the A-l and do some­\nthing else instead, tell yourself quite emphatically that you're \nat Decision Time. Remind yourself what an important time it \nis. Caution yourself to slow down. Now use these three ways \nto help you overcome your distaste for the A-l: \n(1) Deal with the unpleasantness directly. \n(2) Recognize the greater unpleasantness that results from \ndelay. \n(3) Create enthusiasm that counterbalances the unpleas­\nantness. \nI'll deal with each of these in detail. Once you have all \nthree in your toolkit, you can use whichever seems most ap­\npropriate to give you the extra push you need at Decision \nTime for doing the A-l now. \n18. DON'T LET FEAR GET IN YOUR WAY \nHow MANY, TIMES have you avoided doing something im­\nportant because you were afraid of making a mistake? Or \ngetting angry? Or feeling guilty? Or hurting yourself or oth­\ners? Or being rejected? Or taking on too much responsibility? \nOr confronting the unknown? Lots of times, I'm sure. \nI'm not a psychiatrist, so it would be presumptuous of me \nto make any diagnosis, especially at long distance, of any­\none's particular emotional hang-up. The techniques I discuss \nin mis chapter work in a bypass fashion; they are not intend­\ned to cure anyone of any particular emotional problem, but \nto allow him to function while he either works his problem \nout himself or gets professional help. \nm deal primarily with fear, because my conversations with \npsychiatrists and psychologists have convinced me that fear is \nat the root of all avoidance. If you can conquer your fear, \nyou can do that unpleasant A-l. \nI have encountered many cases of people avoiding a task \nto which they have assigned a high priority because subcon­\nsciously they feared the consequences that would follow once \nthe task was completed. \nThe sales executive mentioned earlier kept procrastinating \non his A-l of trying to sell a new account because of his fear \nof adding further to his workload if he were",

Once you've decided to do a task, you may as well do \nthe best you can and try to enjoy yourself. \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LD7E 127 \nIf you sense you're about to avoid the A-l and do some­\nthing else instead, tell yourself quite emphatically that you're \nat Decision Time. Remind yourself what an important time it \nis. Caution yourself to slow down. Now use these three ways \nto help you overcome your distaste for the A-l: \n(1) Deal with the unpleasantness directly. \n(2) Recognize the greater unpleasantness that results from \ndelay. \n(3) Create enthusiasm that counterbalances the unpleas­\nantness. \nI'll deal with each of these in detail. Once you have all \nthree in your toolkit, you can use whichever seems most ap­\npropriate to give you the extra push you need at Decision \nTime for doing the A-l now. \n18. DON'T LET FEAR GET IN YOUR WAY \nHow MANY, TIMES have you avoided doing something im­\nportant because you were afraid of making a mistake",

    "text": " successful. His \nfear needed to be allayed by clearing away some of bis other \nwork; only then did he stop avoiding his high-priority A and \ngo after that big account \nA supervisor was asked to develop a procedure manual for \na job that he had always personally directed. His boss made \nit very clear that the manual had a higher priority than any­\nthing else. Again and again the supervisor put the task at the \nhead of his To Do List yet he did nothing about working on \nthe manual. Finally he realized he was procrastinating out of \nfear that if he finished the procedure manual, he might even-\n128 \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 129 \ntually be out of a job. He would no longer be indispensable. \nHis real A-l was a talk with his boss to clarify what his \nstatus would be once the job on the manual was done. \nDon't let your emotions do you in. If you suspect you are \navoiding the A-l because of some fear, then at Decision Time \nask yourself, \"What am I afraid of?\" Make a list of possibili­\nties and single out the fear that is most likely causing the \navoidance. Then confront that fear head on. How? Take the \ncase of Mr. Blue. \nMr. Blue was a sales representative for an industrial-prod­\nucts firm. He knew that the best use of his time was to \ndevelop contacts with as many new purchasing agents as pos­\nsible. Nevertheless, he always stretched out his visits to those \nagents who were old friends, even though many of them \ncould repay him only in talk and not in profit. He avoided \nmaking calls on new agents, because they occasionally reject­\ned him or treated him rudely. \nNow Mr. Blue had prepared an annual sales plan. It \nrightly emphasized new agent contacts, but from the very \nfirst day he tried to implement the plan, he found himself \nrunning away. His fear of feeling rejected was clearly pre­\nventing him from following through on his wonderful plan. \nDetermined to find some solution to his dilemma, Mr. Blue \ndecided to focus on one particular goal—to see the purchas­\ning agent from the Ajax Company. He'd long wanted to go \nafter the Ajax account The chance of actually closing this \nsale was truly exciting. But he was scared that the agent \nmight turn him down with some devastating comment and \nthen he would be worse off than before. \nHow to Extinguish Fear \nAs he contemplated the telephone call to the Ajax agent \nand felt fear holding him back, Mr. Blue told himself that \nbeing afraid was silly; that there was nothing to worry about; \nthat he had more important things to do than worrying. In \neffect he said to his fear, \"Go away, you're bothering me.\" \nThis had often helped him over the hump he confronted be­\nfore making a call to a new agent but since he had particu­\nlarly strong feelings about this agent his pep talk was not a \nsufficient antidote. \n130 ALAN LAKEIN \nIf Mr. Blue's fear had been at a low-enough level—of \ncampfire rather than forest fire proportions—then it could \nprobably have been easily extinguished. But with an out-of-\ncontrol fear, a really threatening emotion, such a solution \nrarely works. Indeed Mr. Blue's current predicament was \nsuch that when he told himself, \"There's nothing to fear,\" it \nonly made matters worse. Not only was he afraid; he was \nafraid that he was afraid when he shouldn't be afraid!

His \nfear needed to be allayed by clearing away some of bis other \nwork; only then did he stop avoiding his high-priority A and \ngo after that big account \nA supervisor was asked to develop a procedure manual for \na job that he had always personally directed. His boss made \nit very clear that the manual had a higher priority than any­\nthing else. Again and again the supervisor put the task at the \nhead of his To Do List yet he did nothing about working on \nthe manual. Finally he realized he was procrastinating out of \nfear that if he finished the procedure manual, he might even-\n128 \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 129 \ntually be out of a job. He would no longer be indispensable. \nHis real A-l was a talk with his boss to clarify what his \nstatus would be once the job on the manual was done. \nDon't let your emotions do you in. If you suspect you are \navoiding the A-l because of some fear, then at Decision Time \nask yourself, \"What am I afraid of?\" Make a list of possibili­\nties and single out the fear that is most likely causing the \navoidance. Then confront that fear head on. How? Take the \ncase of Mr. Blue. \nMr. Blue was a sales representative for an industrial-prod­\nucts firm. He knew that the best use of his time was to \ndevelop contacts with as many new purchasing agents as pos­\nsible. Nevertheless, he always stretched out his visits to those \nagents who were old friends, even though many of them \ncould repay him only in talk and not in profit. He avoided \nmaking calls on new agents, because they occasionally reject­\ned him or treated him rudely. \nNow Mr. Blue had prepared an annual sales plan. It \nrightly emphasized new agent contacts, but from the very \nfirst day he tried to implement the plan, he found himself \nrunning away. His fear of feeling rejected was clearly pre­\nventing him from following through on his wonderful plan. \nDetermined to find some solution to his dilemma, Mr. Blue \ndecided to focus on one particular goal—to see the purchas­\ning agent from the Ajax Company. He'd long wanted to go \nafter the Ajax account The chance of actually closing this \nsale was truly exciting. But he was scared that the agent \nmight turn him down with",

Then confront that fear head on. How? Take the \ncase of Mr. Blue. \nMr. Blue was a sales representative for an industrial-prod­\nucts firm. He knew that the best use of his time was to \ndevelop contacts with as many new purchasing agents as pos­\nsible. Nevertheless, he always stretched out his visits to those \nagents who were old friends, even though many of them \ncould repay him only in talk and not in profit. He avoided \nmaking calls on new agents, because they occasionally reject­\ned him or treated him rudely. \nNow Mr. Blue had prepared an annual sales plan. It \nrightly emphasized new agent contacts, but from the very \nfirst day he tried to implement the plan, he found himself \nrunning away. His fear of feeling rejected was clearly pre­\nventing him from following through on his wonderful plan. \nDetermined to find some solution to his dilemma, Mr. Blue \ndecided to focus on one particular goal",

But he was scared that the agent \nmight turn him down with some devastating comment and \nthen he would be worse off than before. \nHow to Extinguish Fear \nAs he contemplated the telephone call to the Ajax agent \nand felt fear holding him back, Mr. Blue told himself that \nbeing afraid was silly; that there was nothing to worry about; \nthat he had more important things to do than worrying. In \neffect he said to his fear, \"Go away, you're bothering me.\" \nThis had often helped him over the hump he confronted be­\nfore making a call to a new agent but since he had particu­\nlarly strong feelings about this agent his pep talk was not a \nsufficient antidote. \n130 ALAN LAKEIN \nIf Mr. Blue's fear had been at a low-enough level—of \ncampfire rather than forest fire proportions—then it could \nprobably have been easily extinguished. But with an out-of-\ncontrol fear, a really threatening emotion, such a solution \nrarely works. Indeed Mr. Blue's current predicament was \nsuch that when he told himself, \"There's nothing to fear,\" it \nonly made matters worse. Not only was he afraid; he was \nafraid that he was afraid when he shouldn't be afraid! He \ncertainly had to find some other way of handling his fear of \nbeing rejected by the Ajax agent. \nHow to Contain Fear \nA small fire can easily be put out with a little water, but if \na fire is raging uncontrollably, it's best to contain it, to create \nboundaries and then in effect say to the fire, \"You can burn \nall you want inside this circle, but you may not cross this \nline!\" \nMr. Blue found that although he could not extinguish his \nfear, he was able to contain it, at least for the moment. He \nrealized that he might not even get to talk to the feared \nagent, but only to his secretary. Anyway, he thought he'd be \nable to survive a quick, clean \"No\" over the telephone. If he \ndid succeed in making an appointment, there would be plenty \nto worry about, so he would give himself lots of time to in",

    "text": " at a low-enough level—of \ncampfire rather than forest fire proportions—then it could \nprobably have been easily extinguished. But with an out-of-\ncontrol fear, a really threatening emotion, such a solution \nrarely works. Indeed Mr. Blue's current predicament was \nsuch that when he told himself, \"There's nothing to fear,\" it \nonly made matters worse. Not only was he afraid; he was \nafraid that he was afraid when he shouldn't be afraid! He \ncertainly had to find some other way of handling his fear of \nbeing rejected by the Ajax agent. \nHow to Contain Fear \nA small fire can easily be put out with a little water, but if \na fire is raging uncontrollably, it's best to contain it, to create \nboundaries and then in effect say to the fire, \"You can burn \nall you want inside this circle, but you may not cross this \nline!\" \nMr. Blue found that although he could not extinguish his \nfear, he was able to contain it, at least for the moment. He \nrealized that he might not even get to talk to the feared \nagent, but only to his secretary. Anyway",

Mr. Blue wasted a few \nmore seconds daydreaming about how nice it would be if \nnew agents were never in when he called. Then he came back \nto reality, hoped that the man would not be in, and dialed \nthe number. \nIt turned out that the Ajax agent was in, and could see \nMr. Blue the following Monday at 2:30 P.M., four days away. \nAt first the exhilaration that came from actually having \ngotten the appointment kept Mr. Blue busy all afternoon, lin­\ning up other appointments with new agents. \nBut the next morning, when he should have been collecting \ndata and assembling material for the Ajax presentation, Mr. \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LD7E 131 \nBlue found himself procrastinating once more. He kept turn­\ning to other, far less important matters, and in between he \nfretted about the grueling questions the agent would ask. As \nhis fear of failure gathered momentum, he envisioned himself \nappearing foolish and ill-prepared. When he could stand his \npainful imaginings no longer, he escaped to the coffee ma­\nchine down the hall. \nHow to *. Judo\" Your Fear \nAt this point Mr. Blue could neither extinguish his fear nor \ncontain it; he had to face the situation head on. As he re­\nturned to his desk he recalled another strategy he could re­\nsort to—using judo to throw his fear. The idea behind judo, \nhe knew, is to use your opponent's own strength and weight \nagainst him, thereby turning potential defeat into victory. \nMr. Blue's fear was coming at him with great force and ef­\nfect. He would have to throw that fear by using its force to \nhis advantage, rather than letting it do him in. \nAs he sat down at his desk his inner dialogue went some­\nthing like this: \nFEAR: \"I am going to make a fool of myself. I really don't \nknow much about the Ajax Company or how they can best \nuse my products ...\" \nJUDO: \"... if thafs the case, then I better put some time \ninto finding out more about Ajax right away.\" \nFEAR: \"Then there are all those questions I know hell \nask...\" \nJUDO: m. . . and instead of worrying about being ill-\nprepared, I had better try to anticipate his questions and dig \nup the answers right now.\" \nWith his energy more positively channeled, Mr. Blue \ngulped down the last of his coffee and started to research the \nAjax account. Everytime something unpleasant about the up­\ncoming interview occurred to him, he \"judoed\" it. When he \nthought of a terrible mistake he might make, he made a \nmental note not to let that happen. His fear actually spurred \nhim on, since he realized that only conscientious work might \nsave him. There was no procrastinating the rest of Friday; he \nwanted to be sure he was prepared. \nMonday afternoon, on the way over to the Ajax Company, \n132 ALAN LAKE IN \nhe started worrying again. By the time he entered the build­\ning he was shaking all over. All his efforts on Friday would \nbe wasted if his fear kept him from being able to think \nstraight \nBallooning Your Fears \nAt this point Mr. Blue's fear could not be dealt with by \nany of the strategies I have discussed so far. After all, this \nwas it! If ever there was a good time to be afraid, it was \nnow. Mr. Blue realized that his only chance was to give in to \nhis fears completely and hope that they would burn them­\nselves out before it was too late. \nAs he got into the elevator, he asked himself, \"What's the \nworst thing that could possibly happen to me as a result of \nthis visit?\" Perhaps the agent would call his boss and tell him \nthat Mr. Blue was incompetent. Perhaps he would tell all his \nfriends Mr. Blue was an idiot and they should never do busi­\nness with him. \nGetting warmed up, Mr. Blue began to balloon his fears \neven more. His fantasies were easily the equal of Walter \nMitty's. Perhaps the agent would organize a boycott of Mr. \nBlue's products. Perhaps the agent would start a smear cam­\npaign against him and he would be spurned everywhere by \neveryone. With no safe territory left, Mr. Blue pictured",

Mr. Blue wasted a few \nmore seconds daydreaming about how nice it would be if \nnew agents were never in when he called. Then he came back \nto reality, hoped that the man would not be in, and dialed \nthe number. \nIt turned out that the Ajax agent was in, and could see \nMr. Blue the following Monday at 2:30 P.M., four days away. \nAt first the exhilaration that came from actually having \ngotten the appointment kept Mr. Blue busy all afternoon, lin­\ning up other appointments with new agents. \nBut the next morning, when he should have been collecting \ndata and assembling material for the Ajax presentation, Mr. \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LD7E 131 \nBlue found himself procrastinating once more. He kept turn­\ning to other, far less important matters, and in between he \nfretted about the grueling questions the agent would ask. As \nhis fear of failure gathered momentum, he envisioned himself \nappearing foolish and ill-prepared. When he could stand his \npainful imaginings no longer, he escaped to the coffee ma­\nchine down the hall. \nHow to *. Judo\" Your Fear \nAt this point Mr. Blue could neither extinguish his fear nor \ncontain it; he had to face the situation head on. As he re­\nturned to his desk he recalled another strategy he could re­\nsort to—using judo to throw his fear. The idea behind judo, \nhe knew, is to use your opponent's own strength and weight \nagainst him, thereby turning potential defeat into victory. \nMr. Blue's fear was coming at him with great force and ef­\nfect. He would have to throw that fear by using its force to \nhis advantage, rather than letting it do him in. \nAs he sat down at his desk his inner dialogue went some­\nthing like this: \nFEAR: \"I am going to make a fool of myself. I really don't \nknow much about the Ajax Company or how they can best \nuse my products ...\" \nJ",

I really don't \nknow much about the Ajax Company or how they can best \nuse my products ...\" \nJUDO: \"... if thafs the case, then I better put some time \ninto finding out more about Ajax right away.\" \nFEAR: \"Then there are all those questions I know hell \nask...\" \nJUDO: m. . . and instead of worrying about being ill-\nprepared, I had better try to anticipate his questions and dig \nup the answers right now.\" \nWith his energy more positively channeled, Mr. Blue \ngulped down the last of his coffee and started to research the \nAjax account. Everytime something unpleasant about the up­\ncoming interview occurred to him, he \"judoed\" it. When he \nthought of a terrible mistake he might make, he made a \nmental note not to let that happen. His fear actually spurred \nhim on, since he realized that only conscientious work might \nsave him. There was no procrastinating the rest of Friday; he \nwanted to be sure he was prepared. \nMonday afternoon, on the way over to the Ajax Company, \n132 ALAN LAKE IN \nhe started worrying again.

After all, this \nwas it! If ever there was a good time to be afraid, it was \nnow. Mr. Blue realized that his only chance was to give in to \nhis fears completely and hope that they would burn them­\nselves out before it was too late. \nAs he got into the elevator, he asked himself, \"What's the \nworst thing that could possibly happen to me as a result of \nthis visit?\" Perhaps the agent would call his boss and tell him \nthat Mr. Blue was incompetent. Perhaps he would tell all his \nfriends Mr. Blue was an idiot and they should never do busi­\nness with him. \nGetting warmed up, Mr. Blue began to balloon his fears \neven more. His fantasies were easily the equal of Walter \nMitty's. Perhaps",

There was no procrastinating the rest of Friday; he \nwanted to be sure he was prepared. \nMonday afternoon, on the way over to the Ajax Company, \n132 ALAN LAKE IN \nhe started worrying again. By the time he entered the build­\ning he was shaking all over. All his efforts on Friday would \nbe wasted if his fear kept him from being able to think \nstraight \nBallooning Your Fears \nAt this point Mr. Blue's fear could not be dealt with by \nany of the strategies I have discussed so far. After all, this \nwas it! If ever there was a good time to be afraid, it was \nnow. Mr. Blue realized that his only chance was to give in to \nhis fears completely and hope that they would burn them­\nselves out before it was too late. \nAs he got into the elevator, he asked himself, \"What's the \nworst thing that could possibly happen to me as a result of \nthis visit?\" Perhaps the agent would call his boss and tell him \nthat Mr. Blue was incompetent. Perhaps he would tell all his \nfriends",

    "text": " the agent would organize a boycott of Mr. \nBlue's products. Perhaps the agent would start a smear cam­\npaign against him and he would be spurned everywhere by \neveryone. With no safe territory left, Mr. Blue pictured that \nhe would withdraw to a storage closet and starve to death, \nuncared for, completely and finally rejected. \nMr. Blue got off the elevator, walked slowly down the \ncorridor, and was outside the agent's door when he realized \nthat his fears had carried him into complete absurdity. The \nballoon burst. The situation could not possibly be as terrible \nas he had imagined. Having envisioned himself at the point \nof death, he had nowhere to go but up. With a last nervous \nshake, he opened the door. \nIn fact nothing terrible happened. The agent was in, wel­\ncomed Mr. Blue warmly, thanked him for coming over, and \ninquired why Mr. Blue had not come in to see him sooner. \nHe listened attentively as Mr. Blue delivered his well-\nprepared presentation, said he was certainly interested and \nthen and there gave him a small order as a starter. Mr. Blue \nleft his office and breathed a great sigh of relief. \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 133 \nIn time, partly because of the confidence that comes from \nsuccesses, but also because he survived the occasional inevi­\ntable rejections intact, he began to look forward to encoun­\nters with new agents as a way of testing himself and reaffirm­\ning his inner strength. He gradually came to disassociate his \nsense of worth as a person from the role he played as a sales­\nman. The agents who turned him down were not rejecting \nhim, they were rejecting his product. This change in attitude \ndid not happen right away; in fact, it took Mr. Blue two \nyears to reduce his fear of rejection to an occasional twinge. \nI should point out that Mr. Blue has behaved as all good \nexamples in books behave—he has managed to exhibit a \nnumber of problems in dealing with fear, and he has bene­\nfited from all the techniques I suggested using. \nI wouldn't expert you to do as well the very first time you \ntry to conquer fears you've built up over the years. But the \nnext time you suspect that some fear is causing you to pro­\ncrastinate on a A-l, try extinguishing, containing, judoing, \nand ballooning that fear until it is afraid to show itself ever \nagain.",

With no safe territory left, Mr. Blue pictured that \nhe would withdraw to a storage closet and starve to death, \nuncared for, completely and finally rejected. \nMr. Blue got off the elevator, walked slowly down the \ncorridor, and was outside the agent's door when he realized \nthat his fears had carried him into complete absurdity. The \nballoon burst. The situation could not possibly be as terrible \nas he had imagined. Having envisioned himself at the point \nof death, he had nowhere to go but up. With a last nervous \nshake, he opened the door. \nIn fact nothing terrible happened. The agent was in, wel­\ncomed Mr. Blue warmly, thanked him for coming over, and \ninquired why Mr. Blue had not come in to see him sooner. \nHe listened attentively as Mr. Blue delivered his well-\nprepared presentation, said he was certainly interested and \nthen and there gave him a small order as a starter. Mr. Blue \nleft his office and breathed a great sigh of relief. \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 133 \nIn time, partly because of the confidence that comes from \nsuccesses, but also because he survived the occasional inevi­\ntable rejections intact, he began to look forward to encoun­\nters with new agents as a way of testing himself and reaffirm­\ning his inner strength. He gradually came to disassociate his \nsense of worth as a person from the role he played as a sales­\nman. The agents who turned him down were not rejecting \nhim, they were rejecting his product. This change in attitude \ndid not happen right away; in fact, it took Mr. Blue two \nyears to reduce his fear of rejection to an occasional twinge. \nI should point out that Mr. Blue has behaved as all good \nexamples in books behave—he has managed to exhibit a \nnumber of problems in dealing with fear, and he has bene­\nfited from all the techniques I suggested using. \nI wouldn't expert you to do as well the very first time you \ntry to conquer fears you've built up over the years.

Mr. Blue \nleft his office and breathed a great sigh of relief. \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 133 \nIn time, partly because of the confidence that comes from \nsuccesses, but also because he survived the occasional inevi­\ntable rejections intact, he began to look forward to encoun­\nters with new agents as a way of testing himself and reaffirm­\ning his inner strength. He gradually came to disassociate his \nsense of worth as a person from the role he played as a sales­\nman. The agents who turned him down were not rejecting \nhim, they were rejecting his product. This change in attitude \ndid not happen right away; in fact, it took Mr. Blue two \nyears to reduce his fear of rejection to an occasional twinge. \nI should point out that Mr. Blue has behaved as all good \nexamples in books behave—he has managed to exhibit a \nnumber of problems in dealing with fear, and he has bene­\nfited from all the techniques I suggested using. \n",
