McKay\nOne of the best ways for you to overcome procrastination and get\nmore things done faster is for you to have everything you need athand before you begin. When you are fully prepared, you are like a\ncocked gun or an archer with an arrow pulled back taut in the bow.\nYou just need one small mental push to get started on your highestvalue tasks.\nThis is like getting everything ready to prepare a complete meal, such\nas eating a big frog. You get all the ingredients out on the counter infront of you and then begin putting the dinner together, one step at a\ntime.\nBegin by clearing off your desk or workspace so that you only have\none task in front of you. If necessary, put everything on the floor or\non the table behind you. Gather all the information, reports, details,\npapers, and work materials that you will require to complete the job.\nHave them at hand so you can reach them without getting up or\nmoving.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 65Be sure that you have all writing materials, computer disks, access\ncodes, email addresses and everything else you need to start and\ncontinue working until the job is done.\nSet up your work area so that it is comfortable, attractive and\nconducive to working for long periods. Especially, make sure that\nyou have a comfortable chair that supports your back and allows\nyour feet to sit flat on the floor.\nCreate a Comfortable Work Space\nThe most productive people take the time to create a work area\nwhere they enjoy spending time. The cleaner and neater your work\narea before you begin, the easier it is for you to get started and keep\ngoing.\nOne of the great techniques for overcoming procrastination (eating\nfrogs) is for you to get everything completely ready that you need to\nwork, in advance. When everything is laid out in order and sequence,\nyou feel much more like getting on with the job.\nGet On With the Job\nIt is amazing how many books never get written, how many degrees\nnever get completed, how many life changing tasks never get started\nbecause people fail to take the first step of preparing everything in\nadvance.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 66Los Angeles attracts people from all over America who dream of\nwriting a successful movie script and selling it to one of the studios.\nThey move to Los Angeles and work at low level jobs for years while\nthey dream of writing and selling a popular script.\nRecently, the Los Angeles Times  sent a reporter out onto Wilshire\nBoulevard to interview passers by. When people came along, he\nasked them one question: \"How is your script coming?\" Three out offour passersby replied, \"Almost done!\"\nThe sad fact is that \"almost done\" probably meant \"not yet started.\"\nDon’t let this happen to you.\nLaunch toward Your Dreams\nOnce you have completed your preparations, it is essential that you\nlaunch immediately toward your goals. Get started. Do the first\nthing, whatever it is.\nMy personal rule is “get it 80% right and then correct it later.” Run it\nup the flagpole and see if anyone salutes. Don’t expect perfection the\nfirst time, or even the first few times. Be prepared to fail over and\nover before you get it right.\nThe biggest enemies we have to overcome on the road to success are\nnot lack of ability or opportunity, but fears of failure and rejection,\nand the doubts that they trigger.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 67The only way to overcome your fears is to “do the thing you fear,”\nand as Emerson wrote, “the death of fear is certain.”\nWayne Gretsky, the great hockey player, once said, “You miss every\nshot you don’t take.”\nOnce you have completed your preparations, have the courage to\ntake the first action, and everything else will follow from that. The\nway you develop the courage you  need is to “act as if” you alreadyhad the courage, and behave accordingly.\nTake the First Step\nWhen you sit down, with everything in front of you, ready to go,\nassume the body language of high performance. Sit up straight, sit\nforward and away from the back of the chair. Carry yourself as\nthough you were an efficient, effective high performing personality.Then, pick up the first item and say to yourself, \"Let's get to work!\"\nand plunge in. And once you've started, keep going until the job is\nfinished.\nEat That Frog!\n1. Take a good look at your desk or office, both at home and at the\noffice. Ask yourself, “What kind of a person works",

McKay\nOne of the best ways for you to overcome procrastination and get\nmore things done faster is for you to have everything you need athand before you begin. When you are fully prepared, you are like a\ncocked gun or an archer with an arrow pulled back taut in the bow.\nYou just need one small mental push to get started on your highestvalue tasks.\nThis is like getting everything ready to prepare a complete meal, such\nas eating a big frog. You get all the ingredients out on the counter infront of you and then begin putting the dinner together, one step at a\ntime.\nBegin by clearing off your desk or workspace so that you only have\none task in front of you. If necessary, put everything on the floor or\non the table behind you. Gather all the information, reports, details,\npapers, and work materials that you will require to complete the job.\nHave them at hand so you can reach them without getting up or\nmoving.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 65Be sure that you have all writing materials, computer disks, access\ncodes, email addresses and everything else you need to start and\ncontinue working until the job is done.\nSet up your work area so that it is comfortable, attractive and\nconducive to working for long periods. Especially, make sure that\nyou have a comfortable chair that supports your back and allows\nyour feet to sit flat on the floor.\nCreate a Comfortable Work Space\nThe most productive people take the time to create a work area\nwhere they enjoy spending time. The cleaner and neater your work\narea before you begin, the easier it is for you to get started and keep\ngoing.\nOne of the great techniques for overcoming procrastination (eating\nfrogs) is for you to get everything completely ready that you need to\nwork, in advance. When everything is laid out in order and sequence,\nyou feel much more like getting on with the job.\nGet On With the Job\nIt is amazing how many books never get written, how many degrees\nnever get completed, how many life changing tasks never get started\nbecause people fail to take the first step of preparing everything in\nadvance.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 66Los",

When you are fully prepared, you are like a\ncocked gun or an archer with an arrow pulled back taut in the bow.\nYou just need one small mental push to get started on your highestvalue tasks.\nThis is like getting everything ready to prepare a complete meal, such\nas eating a big frog. You get all the ingredients out on the counter infront of you and then begin putting the dinner together, one step at a\ntime.\nBegin by clearing off your desk or workspace so that you only have\none task in front of you. If necessary, put everything on the floor or\non the table behind you. Gather all the information, reports, details,\npapers, and work materials that you will require to complete the job.\nHave them at hand so you can reach them without getting up or\nmoving.\nEAT THAT FROG",

    "text": " how many books never get written, how many degrees\nnever get completed, how many life changing tasks never get started\nbecause people fail to take the first step of preparing everything in\nadvance.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 66Los Angeles attracts people from all over America who dream of\nwriting a successful movie script and selling it to one of the studios.\nThey move to Los Angeles and work at low level jobs for years while\nthey dream of writing and selling a popular script.\nRecently, the Los Angeles Times  sent a reporter out onto Wilshire\nBoulevard to interview passers by. When people came along, he\nasked them one question: \"How is your script coming?\" Three out offour passersby replied, \"Almost done!\"\nThe sad fact is that \"almost done\" probably meant \"not yet started.\"\nDon’t let this happen to you.\nLaunch toward Your Dreams\nOnce you have completed your preparations, it is essential that you\nlaunch immediately toward your goals. Get started. Do the first\nthing, whatever it is.\nMy personal rule is “get it 80% right and then correct it later.” Run it\nup the flagpole and see if anyone salutes. Don’t expect perfection the\nfirst time, or even the first few times. Be prepared to fail over and\nover before you get it right.\nThe biggest enemies we have to overcome on the road to success are\nnot lack of ability or opportunity, but fears of failure and rejection,\nand the doubts that they trigger.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 67The only way to overcome your fears is to “do the thing you fear,”\nand as Emerson wrote, “the death of fear is certain.”\nWayne Gretsky, the great hockey player, once said, “You miss every\nshot you don’t take.”\nOnce you have completed your preparations, have the courage to\ntake the first action, and everything else will follow from that. The\nway you develop the courage you  need is to “act as if” you alreadyhad the courage, and behave accordingly.\nTake the First Step\nWhen you sit down, with everything in front of you, ready to go,\nassume the body language of high performance. Sit up straight, sit\nforward and away from the back of the chair. Carry yourself as\nthough you were an efficient, effective high performing personality.Then, pick up the first item and say to yourself, \"Let's get to work!\"\nand plunge in.",

When people came along, he\nasked them one question: \"How is your script coming?\" Three out offour passersby replied, \"Almost done!\"\nThe sad fact is that \"almost done\" probably meant \"not yet started.\"\nDon’t let this happen to you.\nLaunch toward Your Dreams\nOnce you have completed your preparations, it is essential that you\nlaunch immediately toward your goals. Get started. Do the first\nthing, whatever it is.\nMy personal rule is “get it 80% right and then correct it later.” Run it\nup the flagpole and see if anyone salutes. Don’t expect perfection the\nfirst",

Don’t expect perfection the\nfirst time, or even the first few times. Be prepared to fail over and\nover before you get it right.\nThe biggest enemies we have to overcome on the road to success are\nnot lack of ability or opportunity, but fears of failure and rejection,\nand the doubts that they trigger.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 67The only way to overcome your fears is to “do the thing you fear,”\nand as Emerson wrote, “the death of fear is certain.”\nWayne Gretsky, the great hockey player, once said, “You miss every\nshot you don’t take.”\nOnce you have completed your preparations, have the courage to\ntake the first action, and everything else will follow from that. The\nway you develop the courage you  need is to “act as if” you alreadyhad the courage, and behave accordingly.\nTake the First Step\nWhen you sit down, with everything in front of you, ready to go,\nassume the body language of high performance.
