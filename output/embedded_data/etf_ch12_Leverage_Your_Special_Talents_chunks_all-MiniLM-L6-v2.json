Not just your work and no more, but a little more\nfor the lavishings sake – that little more that is worth all the rest.”\nDean Briggs\nYou are remarkable! You have special talents and abilities that make\nyou different from every other person who has ever lived. There arefrogs you can eat, or learn to eat, that can make you one of the most\nimportant people in your business or organization.\nThere are certain things that you can do, or that you can learn to do,\nthat can make you extraordinarily valuable to yourself and to others.\nYour job is to identify your special areas of uniqueness and then to\ncommit yourself to becoming very, very good in those areas.\nIncrease Your Earning Ability\nYour most valuable asset, in terms of cash flow, is your \"earning\nability.\" Your ability to work enables you to bring tens of thousands\nof dollars into your life every year by simply applying your\nknowledge and skills to your world. This is your ability to eat specific\nfrogs faster and better than others.\nYou could lose everything you own - your house, your car, your job,\nyour bank account- but as long as you still had your earning ability,\nyou could make it all back and more besides.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 77Take stock of your unique talents and abilities on a regular basis.\nWhat is it that you do especially well? What are you good at? What\ndo you do easily and well that is difficult for other people? Looking\nback at your career, what has been most responsible for your successin life and work to date? What have been the most significant frogsyou have eaten in the past?\nDo What You Love to Do\nYou are designed in such a way that you will most enjoy doing the\nvery things that you have the ability to be the very best at. What is it\nthat you enjoy the most about your work? What kind of frogs do youmost enjoy eating? The very fact that you enjoy something means\nthat you probably have within yourself the capability to be excellent\nin that area.\nOne of your great responsibilities in life is for you to decide for\nyourself what it is that you really love to do and then to throw your\nwhole heart into doing that special thing very, very well.\nLook at your various tasks and responsibilities. What is it that you do\nthat gets you the most compliments and praise from other people?\nWhat do you do that positively affects the work and performance of\nother people more than anyone else?\nSuccessful people are invariably those who have taken the time to\nidentify what they do well and most enjoy. They know what they do\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 78that really makes a difference in their work, and they then\nconcentrate on that task or area of activity exclusively.\nYou should always focus your best energies and abilities on starting\nand completing those key tasks where your unique talents andabilities enable you to do it well and make a significant contribution.\nYou cannot do everything but you can do those few things in which\nyou excel, the few things that can really make a difference.\nEat That Frog!\n1.   Continually ask yourself these key questions: “What am I really\ngood at? What do I enjoy the most about my work? What has been\nmost responsible for my success in the past? If I could do any job at\nall, what job would it be?”\nIf you won the lottery or came into an enormous amount of money,\nand you could choose any job or any part of a job to do for the\nindefinite future, what work would you choose?\n2.  Develop a personal plan to prepare yourself to do your most\nimportant tasks in an excellent fashion. Focus on those areas where\nyou have special talents, and which you most enjoy doing. This is the\nkey to unlocking your personal potential.",
