Any sitting president would have access to\nlaunch codes that could kill millions of people but would\nnever actually see anyone die because he would always be\nthousands of miles away .\n“My suggestion was quite simple,” he wrote in 1981.\n“Put that [nuclear] code number in a little capsule, and\nthen implant that capsule right next to the heart of a\nvolunteer . The volunteer would carry with him a big, heavy\nbutcher knife as he accompanied the President. If ever the\nPresident wanted to ﬁre nuclear weapons, the only way he\ncould do so would be for him ﬁrst, with his own hands, to\nkill one human being. The President says, ‘George, I’m\nsorry but tens of millions must die.’ He has to look at\nsomeone and realize what death is—what an innocent\ndeath is. Blood on the White House carpet. It’s reality\nbrought home.\n“When I suggested this to friends in the P entagon they\nsaid, ‘My God, that’s terrible. Having to kill someone would\ndistort the President’s judgment. He might never push the\nbutton.’”\nThroughout our discussion of the 4th Law of Behavior\nChange we have covered the importance of making good\nhabits immediately satisfying. Fisher’s proposal is an\ninversion of the 4th Law: Make it immediately unsatisfying.\nJust as we are more likely to repeat an experience when\nthe ending is satisfying, we are also more likely to avoid an\nexperience when the ending is painful. P ain is an eﬀective\nteacher . If a failure is painful, it gets ﬁxed. If a failure is\nrelatively painless, it gets ignored. The more immediate\nand more costly a mistake is, the faster you will learn from\nit. The threat of a bad review forces a plumber to be good\nat his job. The possibility of a customer never returning\nmakes restaurants create good food. The cost of cutting the\nwrong blood vessel makes a surgeon master human\nanatomy and cut carefully . When the consequences are\nsevere, people learn quickly .\nThe more immediate the pain, the less likely the\nbehavior . If you want to prevent bad habits and eliminate\nunhealthy behaviors, then adding an instant cost to the\naction is a great way to reduce their odds.\nWe repeat bad habits because they serve us in some way ,\nand that makes them hard to abandon. The best way I know\nto overcome this predicament is to increase the speed of\nthe punishment associated with the behavior . There can’t\nbe a gap between the action and the consequences.\nAs soon as actions incur an immediate consequence,\nbehavior begins to change. Customers pay their bills on\ntime when they are charged a late fee. Students show up to\nclass when their grade is linked to attendance. W e’ll jump\nthrough a lot of hoops to avoid a little bit of immediate\npain.\nThere is, of course, a limit to this. If you’re going to rely\non punishment to change behavior , then the strength of the\npunishment must match the relative strength of the\nbehavior it is trying to correct. T o be productive, the cost of\nprocrastination must be greater than the cost of action. T o\nbe healthy , the cost of laziness must be greater than the\ncost of exercise. Getting ﬁned for smoking in a restaurant\nor failing to recycle adds consequence to an action.\nBehavior only shifts if the punishment is painful enough\nand reliably enforced.\nIn general, the more local, tangible, concrete, and\nimmediate the consequence, the more likely it is to\ninﬂuence individual behavior . The more global, intangible,\nvague, and delayed the consequence, the less likely it is to\ninﬂuence individual behavior .\nThankfully , there is a straightforward way to add an\nimmediate cost to any bad habit: create a habit contract .\nTHE HABIT CONTRACT\nThe ﬁrst seat belt law was passed in New Y ork on\nDecember 1, 1984. A t the time, just 14 percent of people in\nthe United States regularly wore a seat belt—but that",

Any sitting president would have access to\nlaunch codes that could kill millions of people but would\nnever actually see anyone die because he would always be\nthousands of miles away .\n“My suggestion was quite simple,” he wrote in 1981.\n“Put that [nuclear] code number in a little capsule, and\nthen implant that capsule right next to the heart of a\nvolunteer . The volunteer would carry with him a big, heavy\nbutcher knife as he accompanied the President. If ever the\nPresident wanted to ﬁre nuclear weapons, the only way he\ncould do so would be for him ﬁrst, with his own hands, to\nkill one human being. The President says, ‘George, I’m\nsorry but tens of millions must die.’ He has to look at\nsomeone and realize what death is—what an innocent\ndeath is. Blood on the White House carpet. It’s reality\nbrought home.\n“When I suggested this to friends in the P entagon they\nsaid, ‘My God, that’s terrible. Having to kill someone would\ndistort the President’s judgment. He might never push the\nbutton.’”\nThroughout our discussion of the 4th Law of Behavior\nChange we have covered the importance of making good\nhabits immediately satisfying. Fisher’s proposal is an\ninversion of the 4th Law: Make it immediately unsatisfying.\nJust as we are more likely to repeat an experience when\nthe ending is satisfying, we are also more likely to avoid an\nexperience when the ending is painful. P ain is an eﬀective\nteacher . If a failure is painful, it gets ﬁxed. If a failure is\nrelatively painless, it gets ignored. The more immediate\nand",

    "text": "experience when the ending is painful. P ain is an eﬀective\nteacher . If a failure is painful, it gets ﬁxed. If a failure is\nrelatively painless, it gets ignored. The more immediate\nand more costly a mistake is, the faster you will learn from\nit. The threat of a bad review forces a plumber to be good\nat his job. The possibility of a customer never returning\nmakes restaurants create good food. The cost of cutting the\nwrong blood vessel makes a surgeon master human\nanatomy and cut carefully . When the consequences are\nsevere, people learn quickly .\nThe more immediate the pain, the less likely the\nbehavior . If you want to prevent bad habits and eliminate\nunhealthy behaviors, then adding an instant cost to the\naction is a great way to reduce their odds.\nWe repeat bad habits because they serve us in some way ,\nand that makes them hard to abandon. The best way I know\nto overcome this predicament is to increase the speed of\nthe punishment associated with the behavior . There can’t\nbe a gap between the action and the consequences.\nAs soon as actions incur an immediate consequence,\nbehavior begins to change. Customers pay their bills on\ntime when they are charged a late fee. Students show up to\nclass when their grade is linked to attendance. W e’ll jump\nthrough a lot of hoops to avoid a little bit of immediate\npain.\nThere is, of course, a limit to this. If you’re going to rely\non punishment to change behavior , then the strength of the\npunishment must match the relative strength of the\nbehavior it is trying to correct. T o be productive, the cost of\nprocrastination must be greater than the cost of action. T o\nbe healthy , the cost of laziness must be greater than the\ncost of exercise. Getting ﬁned for smoking in a restaurant\nor failing to recycle adds consequence to an action.\nBehavior only shifts if the punishment is painful enough\nand reliably enforced.\nIn general, the more local, tangible, concrete, and\nimmediate the consequence, the more likely it is to\ninﬂuence individual behavior . The more global, intangible,\nvague, and delayed the consequence, the less likely it is to\ninﬂuence individual behavior .\nThankfully , there is a straightforward way to add an\nimmediate cost to any bad habit: create a habit contract .\nTHE HAB",

There can’t\nbe a gap between the action and the consequences.\nAs soon as actions incur an immediate consequence,\nbehavior begins to change. Customers pay their bills on\ntime when they are charged a late fee. Students show up to\nclass when their grade is linked to attendance. W e’ll jump\nthrough a lot of hoops to avoid a little bit of immediate\npain.\nThere is, of course, a limit to this. If you’re going to rely\non punishment to change behavior , then the strength of the\npunishment must match the relative strength of the\nbehavior it is trying to correct. T o be productive, the cost of\nprocrastination must be greater than the cost of action. T o\nbe healthy , the cost of laziness must be greater than the\ncost of exercise. Getting ﬁned for smoking in a restaurant\nor failing to recycle adds consequence to an action.\nBehavior only shifts if the punishment is painful enough\nand reliably enforced.\nIn general, the more local, tangible, concrete, and\nimmediate the consequence, the more likely it is to\ninﬂuence individual behavior . The more global, intangible,\nvague",

    "text": "IT CONTRACT\nThe ﬁrst seat belt law was passed in New Y ork on\nDecember 1, 1984. A t the time, just 14 percent of people in\nthe United States regularly wore a seat belt—but that was\nall about to change.\nWithin ﬁve years, over half of the nation had seat belt\nlaws. T oday, wearing a seat belt is enforceable by law in\nforty-nine of the ﬁfty states. And it’s not just the legislation,\nthe number of people wearing seat belts has changed\ndramatically as well. In 2016, over 88 percent of Americans\nbuckled up each time they got in a car . In just over thirty\nyears, there was a complete reversal in the habits of\nmillions of people.\nLaws and regulations are an example of how government\ncan change our habits by creating a social contract. As a\nsociety , we collectively agree to abide by certain rules and\nthen enforce them as a group. Whenever a new piece of\nlegislation impacts behavior—seat belt laws, banning\nsmoking inside restaurants, mandatory recycling—it is an\nexample of a social contract shaping our habits. The group\nagrees to act in a certain way , and if you don’t follow along,\nyou’ll be punished.\nJust as governments use laws to hold citizens\naccountable, you can create a habit contract to hold\nyourself accountable. A habit contract is a verbal or written\nagreement in which you state your commitment to a\nparticular habit and the punishment that will occur if you\ndon’t follow through. Then you ﬁnd one or two people to\nact as your accountability partners and sign oﬀ on the\ncontract with you.\nBryan Harris, an entrepreneur from Nashville,\nTennessee, was the ﬁrst person I saw put this strategy into\naction. Shortly after the birth of his son, Harris realized he\nwanted to shed a few pounds. He wrote up a habit contract\nbetween himself , his wife, and his personal trainer . The ﬁrst\nversion read, “Bryan’s #1 objective for Q1 of 2017 is to\nstart eating correctly again so he feels better , looks better ,\nand is able to hit his long-term goal of 200 pounds at 10%\nbody fat.”\nBelow that statement, Harris laid out a road map for\nachieving his ideal outcome:\nPhase #1: Get back to a strict “slow-carb” diet in Q1.\nPhase #2: Start a strict macronutrient tracking\nprogram in Q2.\nPhase #3: Reﬁne and maintain the details of his diet\nand workout program in Q3.\nFinally , he wrote out each of the daily habits that would\nget him to his goal. F or example, “ Write down all food that\nhe consumes each day and weigh himself each day .”\nAnd then he listed the punishment if he failed: “If Bryan\ndoesn’t do these two items then the following consequence\nwill be enforced: He will have to dress up each workday\nand each Sunday morning for the rest of the quarter . Dress\nup is deﬁned as not wearing jeans, t-shirts, hoodies, or\nshorts. He will also give Joey (his trainer) $200 to use as he\nsees ﬁt if he misses one day of logging food.”\nAt the bottom of the page, Harris, his wife, and his\ntrainer all signed the contract.\nMy initial reaction was that a contract like this seemed\noverly formal and unnecessary , especially the signatures.\nBut Harris convinced me that signing the contract was an\nindication of seriousness. “ Anytime I skip this part,” he\nsaid, “I start slacking almost immediately .”\nThree months later , after hitting his targets for Q1,\nHarris upgraded his goals. The consequences escalated,\ntoo. If he missed his carbohydrate and protein targets, he\nhad to pay his trainer $100. And if he failed to weigh\nhimself , he had to give his wife $500 to use as she saw ﬁt.\nPerhaps most painfully , if he forgot to run sprints, he had to\ndress up for work every day and wear an Alabama hat the\nrest of the quarter—the bitter rival of his beloved Auburn\nteam.\nThe strategy worked. W ith his wife and trainer acting as\naccountability partners and with the habit contract\nclarifying exactly what to do each day , Harris lost the\nweight. *\nTo make bad habits unsatisfying, your best option is to\nmake them painful in the moment. Creating a habit\ncontract is a straightforward way to do exactly that.\nEven if you don’t want to create a full-blown habit\ncontract, simply having an accountability partner is useful.\nThe comedian Margaret Cho writes a joke or song every\nday.

    "text": "IT CONTRACT\nThe ﬁrst seat belt law was passed in New Y ork on\nDecember 1, 1984. A t the time, just 14 percent of people in\nthe United States regularly wore a seat belt—but that was\nall about to change.\nWithin ﬁve years, over half of the nation had seat belt\nlaws. T oday, wearing a seat belt is enforceable by law in\nforty-nine of the ﬁfty states. And it’s not just the legislation,\nthe number of people wearing seat belts has changed\ndramatically as well. In 2016, over 88 percent of Americans\nbuckled up each time they got in a car . In just over thirty\nyears, there was a complete reversal in the habits of\nmillions of people.\nLaws and regulations are an example of how government\ncan change our habits by creating a social contract. As a\nsociety , we collectively agree to abide by certain rules and\nthen enforce them as a group. Whenever a new piece of\nlegislation impacts behavior—seat belt laws, banning\nsmoking inside restaurants, mandatory recycling—it is an\nexample of a social contract shaping our habits. The group\nagrees to act in a certain way , and if you don’t follow along,\nyou’ll be punished.\nJust as governments use laws to hold citizens\naccountable, you can create a habit contract to hold\nyourself accountable. A habit contract is a verbal or written\nagreement in which you state your commitment to a\nparticular habit and the punishment that will occur if you\ndon’t follow through. Then you ﬁnd one or two people to\nact as your accountability partners and sign oﬀ on the\ncontract with you.\nBryan Harris, an entrepreneur from Nashville,\nTennessee, was the ﬁrst person I saw put this strategy into\naction. Shortly after the birth of his son, Harris realized he\nwanted to shed a few pounds. He wrote up a habit contract\nbetween himself , his wife, and his personal trainer . The ﬁrst\nversion read, “Bryan’s #1 objective for Q1 of 2017 is to\nstart eating correctly again so he feels better , looks better ,\nand is able to hit his long-term goal of 200 pounds at 10%\nbody fat.”\nBelow that statement, Harris laid out a road map for\nachieving his ideal outcome:\nPhase #1: Get back to",

    "text": " better , looks better ,\nand is able to hit his long-term goal of 200 pounds at 10%\nbody fat.”\nBelow that statement, Harris laid out a road map for\nachieving his ideal outcome:\nPhase #1: Get back to a strict “slow-carb” diet in Q1.\nPhase #2: Start a strict macronutrient tracking\nprogram in Q2.\nPhase #3: Reﬁne and maintain the details of his diet\nand workout program in Q3.\nFinally , he wrote out each of the daily habits that would\nget him to his goal. F or example, “ Write down all food that\nhe consumes each day and weigh himself each day .”\nAnd then he listed the punishment if he failed: “If Bryan\ndoesn’t do these two items then the following consequence\nwill be enforced: He will have to dress up each workday\nand each Sunday morning for the rest of the quarter . Dress\nup is deﬁned as not wearing jeans, t-shirts, hoodies, or\nshorts. He will also give Joey (his trainer) $200 to use as he\nsees ﬁt if he misses one day of logging food.”\nAt the bottom of the page, Harris, his wife, and his\ntrainer all signed the contract.\nMy initial reaction was that a contract like this seemed\noverly formal and unnecessary , especially the signatures.\nBut Harris convinced me that signing the contract was an\nindication of seriousness. “ Anytime I skip this part,” he\nsaid, “I start slacking almost immediately .”\nThree months later , after hitting his targets for Q1,\nHarris upgraded his goals. The consequences escalated,\ntoo. If he missed his carbohydrate and protein targets, he\nhad to pay his trainer $100. And if he failed to weigh\nhimself , he had to give his wife $500 to use as she saw ﬁt.\nPerhaps most painfully , if he forgot to run sprints, he had to\ndress up for work every day and wear an Alabama hat the\nrest of the quarter—the bitter rival of his beloved Auburn\nteam.\nThe strategy worked. W ith his wife and trainer acting as\naccountability partners and with the habit contract\nclarifying exactly what to do each day , Harris lost the\nweight. *\nTo make bad habits unsatisfying, your best option is to\nmake them painful in the moment. Creating a habit\ncontract is a straightforward way to do exactly that",

F or example, “ Write down all food that\nhe consumes each day and weigh himself each day .”\nAnd then he listed the punishment if he failed: “If Bryan\ndoesn’t do these two items then the following consequence\nwill be enforced: He will have to dress up each workday\nand each Sunday morning for the rest of the quarter . Dress\nup is deﬁned as not wearing jeans, t-shirts, hoodies, or\nshorts. He will also give Joey (his trainer) $200 to use as he\nsees ﬁt if he misses one day of logging food.”\nAt the bottom of the page, Harris",

She does the “song a day” challenge with a friend,\nwhich helps them both stay accountable. Knowing that\nsomeone is watching can be a powerful motivator . You are\nless likely to procrastinate or give up because there is an\nimmediate cost. If you don’t follow through, perhaps they’ll\nsee you as untrustworthy or lazy . Suddenly , you are not only\nfailing to uphold your promises to yourself , but also failing\nto uphold your promises to others.\nYou can even automate this process. Thomas Frank, an\nentrepreneur in Boulder , Colorado, wakes up at 5:55 each\nmorning. And if he doesn’t, he has a tweet automatically\nscheduled that says, “It’s 6:10 and I’m not up because I’m\nlazy! Reply to this for $5 via P ayPal (limit 5), assuming my\nalarm didn’t malfunction.”\nWe are always trying to present our best selves to the\nworld. W e comb our hair and brush our teeth and dress\nourselves carefully because we know these habits are likely\nto get a positive reaction. W e want to get good grades and\ngraduate from top schools to impress potential employers\nand mates and our friends and family . We care about the\nopinions of those around us because it helps if others like\nus. This is precisely why getting an accountability partner\nor signing a habit contract can work so well.\nChapter Summary\nThe inversion of the 4th Law of Behavior Change is\nmake it unsatisfying .\nWe are less likely to repeat a bad habit if it is painful or\nunsatisfying.\nAn accountability partner can create an immediate cost\nto inaction. W e care deeply about what others think of\nus, and we do not want others to have a lesser opinion\nof us.\nA habit contract can be used to add a social cost to any\nbehavior . It makes the costs of violating your promises\npublic and painful.\nKnowing that someone else is watching you can be a\npowerful motivator .\nHOW TO CREA TE A GOOD HABIT\nThe 1st Law: Mak e It Obvious\n1.1: Fill out the Habits Scor ecard.

She does the “song a day” challenge with a friend,\nwhich helps them both stay accountable. Knowing that\nsomeone is watching can be a powerful motivator . You are\nless likely to procrastinate or give up because there is an\nimmediate cost. If you don’t follow through, perhaps they’ll\nsee you as untrustworthy or lazy . Suddenly , you are not only\nfailing to uphold your promises to yourself , but also failing\nto uphold your promises to others.\nYou can even automate this process. Thomas Frank, an\nentrepreneur in Boulder , Colorado, wakes up at 5:55 each\nmorning. And if he doesn’t, he has a tweet automatically\nscheduled that says, “It’s 6:10 and I’m not up because I’m\nlazy! Reply to this for $5 via P ayPal (limit 5), assuming my\nalarm didn’t malfunction.”\nWe are always trying to present our best selves to the\nworld. W e comb our hair and brush our teeth and dress\nourselves carefully because we know these habits are likely\nto get a positive reaction. W e want to get good grades and\ngraduate from top schools to impress potential employers\nand mates and our friends and family . We care about the\nopinions of those around us because it helps if others like\nus. This is precisely why getting an accountability partner\nor signing a habit contract can work so well.\nChapter Summary\nThe inversion of the 4th Law of Behavior Change is\nmake it unsatisfying .\nWe are less likely to repeat a bad habit if it is painful or\nunsatisfying.\nAn accountability partner can create an immediate cost\nto inaction. W e care deeply about what others think of\nus, and we do not want others to have a lesser opinion\nof us.\nA habit contract can be used to add a social cost to any\nbehavior . It makes the costs of violating your promises\npublic and painful.\nKnowing that someone else is watching you can be a\npowerful motivator .\nHOW TO CREA TE A GOOD HABIT\nThe 1st Law: Mak e It Obvious\n1.1: Fill out the Habits Scor ecard. Write down your cur rent habits to become\nawar e of them.\n1",
