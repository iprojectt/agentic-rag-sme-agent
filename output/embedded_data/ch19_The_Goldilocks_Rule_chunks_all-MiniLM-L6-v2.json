Labor laws were loose back then and the boy\nmanaged to land a position selling guidebooks for $0.50\napiece.\nWithin a year , he had transitioned to Disney’s magic\nshop, where he learned tricks from the older employees. He\nexperimented with jokes and tried out simple routines on\nvisitors. Soon he discovered that what he loved was not\nperforming magic but performing in general. He set his\nsights on becoming a comedian.\nBeginning in his teenage years, he started performing in\nlittle clubs around Los Angeles. The crowds were small and\nhis act was short. He was rarely on stage for more than ﬁve\nminutes. Most of the people in the crowd were too busy\ndrinking or talking with friends to pay attention. One night,\nhe literally delivered his stand-up routine to an empty club.\nIt wasn’t glamorous work, but there was no doubt he was\ngetting better . His ﬁrst routines would only last one or two\nminutes. By high school, his material had expanded to\ninclude a ﬁve-minute act and, a few years later , a ten-\nminute show . At nineteen, he was performing weekly for\ntwenty minutes at a time. He had to read three poems\nduring the show just to make the routine long enough, but\nhis skills continued to progress.\nHe spent another decade experimenting, adjusting, and\npracticing. He took a job as a television writer and,\ngradually , he was able to land his own appearances on talk\nshows. By the mid-1970s, he had worked his way into being\na regular guest on The T onight Show  and Saturday Night\nLive.\nFinally , after nearly ﬁfteen years of work, the young man\nrose to fame. He toured sixty cities in sixty-three days.\nThen seventy-two cities in eighty days. Then eighty-ﬁve\ncities in ninety days. He had 18,695 people attend one\nshow in Ohio . Another 45,000 tickets were sold for his\nthree-day show in New Y ork. He catapulted to the top of his\ngenre and became one of the most successful comedians of\nhis time.\nHis name is Steve Martin.\nMartin’s story oﬀers a fascinating perspective on what it\ntakes to stick with habits for the long run. Comedy is not\nfor the timid. It is hard to imagine a situation that would\nstrike fear into the hearts of more people than performing\nalone on stage and failing to get a single laugh. And yet\nSteve Martin faced this fear every week for eighteen years.\nIn his words, “10 years spent learning, 4 years spent\nreﬁning, and 4 years as a wild success.”\nWhy is it that some people, like Martin, stick with their\nhabits—whether practicing jokes or drawing cartoons or\nplaying guitar—while most of us struggle to stay\nmotivated? How do we design habits that pull us in rather\nthan ones that fade away? Scientists have been studying\nthis question for many years. While there is still much to\nlearn, one of the most consistent ﬁndings is that the way to\nmaintain motivation and achieve peak levels of desire is to\nwork on tasks of “ just manageable diﬀiculty .”\nThe human brain loves a challenge, but only if it is within\nan optimal zone of diﬀiculty . If you love tennis and try to\nplay a serious match against a four-year-old, you will\nquickly become bored. It’s too easy . You’ll win every point.\nIn contrast, if you play a professional tennis player like\nRoger F ederer or Serena W illiams, you will quickly lose\nmotivation because the match is too diﬀicult.\nNow consider playing tennis against someone who is\nyour equal. As the game progresses, you win a few points\nand you lose a few . You have a good chance of winning, but\nonly if you really try . Your focus narrows, distractions fade\naway , and you ﬁnd yourself fully invested in the task at\nhand. This is a challenge of just manageable diﬀiculty and\nit is a prime example of the Goldilocks Rule .\nThe Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak\nmotivation when working on tasks that are right on the\nedge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy .\nJust right.\nTHE GOLDIL OCKS RULE\nFIGURE 15: Maximum motivation occurs when facing a challenge\nof just manageable diﬃculty .

Labor laws were loose back then and the boy\nmanaged to land a position selling guidebooks for $0.50\napiece.\nWithin a year , he had transitioned to Disney’s magic\nshop, where he learned tricks from the older employees. He\nexperimented with jokes and tried out simple routines on\nvisitors. Soon he discovered that what he loved was not\nperforming magic but performing in general. He set his\nsights on becoming a comedian.\nBeginning in his teenage years, he started performing in\nlittle clubs around Los Angeles. The crowds were small and\nhis act was short. He was rarely on stage for more than ﬁve\nminutes. Most of the people in the crowd were too busy\ndrinking or talking with friends to pay attention. One night,\nhe literally delivered his stand-up routine to an empty club.\nIt wasn’t glamorous work, but there was no doubt he was\ngetting better . His ﬁrst routines would only last one or two\nminutes. By high school, his material had expanded to\ninclude a ﬁve-minute act and, a few years later , a ten-\nminute show . At nineteen, he was performing weekly for\ntwenty minutes at a time. He had to read three poems\nduring the show just to make the routine long enough, but\nhis skills continued to progress.\nHe spent another decade experimenting, adjusting, and\npracticing. He took a job as a television writer and,\ngradually , he was able to land his own appearances on talk\nshows. By the mid-1970s, he had worked his way into being\na regular guest on The T onight Show  and Saturday Night\nLive.\nFinally , after nearly ﬁfteen years of work, the young man\nrose to fame. He toured sixty cities in sixty-three days.\nThen seventy-two cities in eighty days. Then eighty-ﬁve\ncities in ninety days. He had 18,695 people attend one\nshow in Ohio . Another 45,000 tickets were sold for his\nthree-day show in New Y ork. He catapulted to the top of his\ngenre and became one of the most successful comedians of\nhis time.\nHis name is",

Labor laws were loose back then and the boy\nmanaged to land a position selling guidebooks for $0.50\napiece.\nWithin a year , he had transitioned to Disney’s magic\nshop, where he learned tricks from the older employees. He\nexperimented with jokes and tried out simple routines on\nvisitors. Soon he discovered that what he loved was not\nperforming magic but performing in general.

One night,\nhe literally delivered his stand-up routine to an empty club.\nIt wasn’t glamorous work, but there was no doubt he was\ngetting better . His ﬁrst routines would only last one or two\nminutes. By high school, his material had expanded to\ninclude a ﬁve-minute act and, a few years later , a ten-\nminute show . At nineteen, he was performing weekly for\ntwenty minutes at a time. He had to read three poems\nduring the show just to make the routine long enough, but\nhis skills continued to progress.\nHe spent another decade experimenting, adjusting, and\npracticing. He took a job as a television writer and,\ngradually , he was able to land his own appearances on talk\nshows. By the mid-1970s, he had worked his way into being\na regular guest on The T onight Show  and Saturday Night\nLive.\nFinally , after nearly ﬁfteen years of work, the young man\nrose to fame. He toured sixty cities in sixty-three days.\nThen seventy-two cities in eighty days. Then eighty-ﬁve\ncities in ninety days. He had 18,695 people attend one\nshow",

    "text": " in Ohio . Another 45,000 tickets were sold for his\nthree-day show in New Y ork. He catapulted to the top of his\ngenre and became one of the most successful comedians of\nhis time.\nHis name is Steve Martin.\nMartin’s story oﬀers a fascinating perspective on what it\ntakes to stick with habits for the long run. Comedy is not\nfor the timid. It is hard to imagine a situation that would\nstrike fear into the hearts of more people than performing\nalone on stage and failing to get a single laugh. And yet\nSteve Martin faced this fear every week for eighteen years.\nIn his words, “10 years spent learning, 4 years spent\nreﬁning, and 4 years as a wild success.”\nWhy is it that some people, like Martin, stick with their\nhabits—whether practicing jokes or drawing cartoons or\nplaying guitar—while most of us struggle to stay\nmotivated? How do we design habits that pull us in rather\nthan ones that fade away? Scientists have been studying\nthis question for many years. While there is still much to\nlearn, one of the most consistent ﬁndings is that the way to\nmaintain motivation and achieve peak levels of desire is to\nwork on tasks of “ just manageable diﬀiculty .”\nThe human brain loves a challenge, but only if it is within\nan optimal zone of diﬀiculty . If you love tennis and try to\nplay a serious match against a four-year-old, you will\nquickly become bored. It’s too easy . You’ll win every point.\nIn contrast, if you play a professional tennis player like\nRoger F ederer or Serena W illiams, you will quickly lose\nmotivation because the match is too diﬀicult.\nNow consider playing tennis against someone who is\nyour equal. As the game progresses, you win a few points\nand you lose a few . You have a good chance of winning, but\nonly if you really try . Your focus narrows, distractions fade\naway , and you ﬁnd yourself fully invested in the task at\nhand. This is a challenge of just manageable diﬀiculty and\nit is a prime example of the Goldilocks Rule .\nThe Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak\nmotivation when working on tasks that are right on the\nedge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy .\n",

    "text": "Just right.\nTHE GOLDIL OCKS RULE\nFIGURE 15: Maximum motivation occurs when facing a challenge\nof just manageable diﬃculty . In psychology r esear ch this is\nknown as the Y erkes–Dodson law, which describes the optimal\nlevel of ar ousal as the midpoint between bor edom and anxiety .\nMartin’s comedy career is an excellent example of the\nGoldilocks Rule in practice. Each year , he expanded his\ncomedy routine—but only by a minute or two . He was\nalways adding new material, but he also kept a few jokes\nthat were guaranteed to get laughs. There were just\nenough victories to keep him motivated and just enough\nmistakes to keep him working hard.\nWhen you’re starting a new habit, it’s important to keep\nthe behavior as easy as possible so you can stick with it\neven when conditions aren’t perfect. This is an idea we\ncovered in detail while discussing the 3rd Law of Behavior\nChange.\nOnce a habit has been established, however , it’s\nimportant to continue to advance in small ways. These little\nimprovements and new challenges keep you engaged. And\nif you hit the Goldilocks Zone just right, you can achieve a\nﬂow state .*\nA ﬂow state is the experience of being “in the zone” and\nfully immersed in an activity . Scientists have tried to\nquantify this feeling. They found that to achieve a state of\nﬂow, a task must be roughly 4 percent beyond your current\nability . In real life it’s typically not feasible to quantify the\ndiﬀiculty of an action in this way , but the core idea of the\nGoldilocks Rule remains: working on challenges of just\nmanageable diﬀiculty—something on the perimeter of your\nability—seems crucial for maintaining motivation.\nImprovement requires a delicate balance. Y ou need to\nregularly search for challenges that push you to your edge\nwhile continuing to make enough progress to stay\nmotivated. Behaviors need to remain novel in order for\nthem to stay attractive and satisfying. W ithout variety , we\nget bored. And boredom is perhaps the greatest villain on\nthe quest for self -improvement.\nHOW TO ST AY FOCUSED WHEN Y OU GET BORED\nWORKING ON Y OUR GO ALS\nAfter my baseball career ended, I was looking for a new\nsport. I joined a weightlifting team and one day an elite\ncoach visited our gym. He had worked with thousands of\nathletes during his long career , including a few Olympians.\nI introduced myself and we began talking about the process\nof improvement.\n“What’s the diﬀerence between the best athletes and\neveryone else?” I asked. “ What do the really successful\npeople do that most don’t?”\nHe mentioned the factors you might expect: genetics,\nluck, talent. But then he said something I wasn’t expecting:\n“At some point it comes down to who can handle the\nboredom of training every day , doing the same lifts over\nand over and over .”\nHis answer surprised me because it’s a diﬀerent way of\nthinking about work ethic. P eople talk about getting\n“amped up” to work on their goals. Whether it’s business or\nsports or art, you hear people say things like, “It all comes\ndown to passion.” Or , “You have to really want it.” As a\nresult, many of us get depressed when we lose focus or\nmotivation because we think that successful people have\nsome bottomless reserve of passion. But this coach was\nsaying that really successful people feel the same lack of\nmotivation as everyone else. The diﬀerence is that they still\nﬁnd a way to show up despite the feelings of boredom.\nMastery requires practice. But the more you practice\nsomething, the more boring and routine it becomes. Once\nthe beginner gains have been made and we learn what to\nexpect, our interest starts to fade. Sometimes it happens\neven faster than that. All you have to do is hit the gym a\nfew days in a row or publish a couple of blog posts on time\nand letting one day slip doesn’t feel like much. Things are\ngoing well. It’s easy to rationalize taking a day oﬀ because\nyou’re in a good place.\nThe greatest threat to success is not failure but\nboredom. W e get bored with habits because they stop\ndelighting us. The outcome becomes expected. And as our\nhabits become ordinary , we start derailing our progress to\nseek novelty . Perhaps this is why we get caught up in a\nnever-ending cycle, jumping from one workout to the next,\none diet to the next, one business idea to the next",

In psychology r esear ch this is\nknown as the Y erkes–Dodson law, which describes the optimal\nlevel of ar ousal as the midpoint between bor edom and anxiety .\nMartin’s comedy career is an excellent example of the\nGoldilocks Rule in practice. Each year , he expanded his\ncomedy routine—but only by a minute or two . He was\nalways adding new material, but he also kept a few jokes\nthat were guaranteed to get laughs. There were just\nenough victories to keep him motivated and just enough\nmistakes to keep him working hard.\nWhen you’re starting a new habit, it’s important to keep\nthe behavior as easy as possible so you can stick with it\neven when conditions aren’t perfect. This is an idea we\ncovered in detail while discussing the 3rd Law of Behavior\nChange.\nOnce a habit has been established, however , it’s\nimportant to continue to advance in small ways. These little\nimprovements and new challenges keep you engaged. And\nif you hit the Goldilocks Zone just right, you can achieve a\nﬂow state .*\nA ﬂow state is the experience of being “in the zone” and\nfully immersed in an activity . Scientists have tried to\nquantify this feeling. They found that to achieve a state of\nﬂow, a task must be roughly 4 percent beyond your current\nability . In real life it’s typically not feasible to quantify the\ndiﬀiculty of an action in this way , but the core idea of the\nGoldilocks Rule remains: working on challenges of just\nmanageable diﬀiculty—something on the perimeter of your\nability—seems crucial for maintaining motivation.\nImprovement requires a delicate balance. Y ou need to\nregularly search for challenges that push you to your edge\nwhile continuing to make enough progress to stay\nmotivated. Behaviors need to remain novel in order for\nthem to stay attractive and satisfying. W ithout variety , we\nget bored. And boredom is perhaps the greatest villain on\nthe quest for self -improvement.\nHOW TO ST AY FOCUSED WHEN Y OU GET BORED\nWORKING ON Y OUR GO ALS\nAfter my baseball career ended, I was",

In psychology r esear ch this is\nknown as the Y erkes–Dodson law, which describes the optimal\nlevel of ar ousal as the midpoint between bor edom and anxiety .\nMartin’s comedy career is an excellent example of the\nGoldilocks Rule in practice. Each year , he expanded his\ncomedy routine—but only by a minute or two . He was\nalways adding new material, but he also kept a few jokes\nthat were guaranteed to get laughs. There were just\nenough victories to keep him motivated and just enough\nmistakes to keep him working hard.\nWhen you’re starting a new habit, it’s important to keep\nthe behavior as easy as possible so you can stick with it\neven when conditions aren’t perfect. This is an idea we\ncovered in detail while discussing the 3rd Law of Behavior\nChange.\nOnce a habit has been established, however , it’s\nimportant to continue to advance in small ways. These little\nimprovements and new challenges keep you engaged. And\nif you hit the Goldilocks Zone",

These little\nimprovements and new challenges keep you engaged. And\nif you hit the Goldilocks Zone just right, you can achieve a\nﬂow state .*\nA ﬂow state is the experience of being “in the zone” and\nfully immersed in an activity . Scientists have tried to\nquantify this feeling. They found that to achieve a state of\nﬂow, a task must be roughly 4 percent beyond your current\nability . In real life it’s typically not feasible to quantify the\ndiﬀiculty of an action in this way , but the core idea of the\nGoldilocks Rule remains: working on challenges of just\nmanageable diﬀiculty—something on the perimeter of your\nability—seems crucial for maintaining motivation.\nImprovement requires a delicate balance. Y ou need to\nregularly search for challenges that push you to your edge\nwhile continuing to make enough progress to stay\nmotivated. Behaviors need to remain novel in order for\nthem to stay attractive and satisfying. W ithout variety , we\nget bored",

And boredom is perhaps the greatest villain on\nthe quest for self -improvement.\nHOW TO ST AY FOCUSED WHEN Y OU GET BORED\nWORKING ON Y OUR GO ALS\nAfter my baseball career ended, I was looking for a new\nsport. I joined a weightlifting team and one day an elite\ncoach visited our gym. He had worked with thousands of\nathletes during his long career , including a few Olympians.\nI introduced myself and we began talking about the process\nof improvement.\n“What’s the diﬀerence between the best athletes and\neveryone else?” I asked. “ What do the really successful\npeople do that most don’t?”\nHe mentioned the factors you might expect: genetics,\nluck, talent. But then he said something I wasn’t expecting:\n“At some point it comes down to who can handle the\nboredom of training every day , doing the same lifts over\nand over and over .”\nHis answer surprised me because it’s a diﬀerent way of\nthinking about work ethic. P eople talk about getting\n“amped up” to work on their goals. Whether it’s business or\nsports or art, you hear people say things like, “It all comes\ndown to passion.” Or , “You have to really want it.” As a\nresult, many of us get depressed when we lose focus or\nmotivation because we think that successful people have\nsome bottomless reserve of passion. But this coach was\nsaying that really successful people feel the same lack of\nmotivation as everyone else. The diﬀerence is that they still\nﬁnd a way to show up despite the feelings of boredom.\nMastery requires practice. But the more you practice\nsomething, the more boring and routine it becomes. Once\nthe beginner gains have been made and we learn what to\nexpect, our interest starts to fade. Sometimes it happens\neven faster than that. All you have to do is hit the gym a\nfew days in a row or publish a couple of blog posts on time\nand letting one day slip doesn’t feel like much. Things are\ngoing well. It’s easy to rationalize taking a day oﬀ because\nyou’re in a good place.\nThe greatest threat to success is not failure but\nboredom. W e get bored with habits because they stop\ndelighting us. The outcome becomes expected. And as our\nhab",

    "text": "its become ordinary , we start derailing our progress to\nseek novelty . Perhaps this is why we get caught up in a\nnever-ending cycle, jumping from one workout to the next,\none diet to the next, one business idea to the next. As soon\nas we experience the slightest dip in motivation, we begin\nseeking a new strategy—even if the old one was still\nworking. As Machiavelli noted, “ Men desire novelty to such\nan extent that those who are doing well wish for a change\nas much as those who are doing badly .”\nPerhaps this is why many of the most habit-forming\nproducts are those that provide continuous forms of\nnovelty . Video games provide visual novelty . Porn provides\nsexual novelty . Junk foods provide culinary novelty . Each of\nthese experiences oﬀer continual elements of surprise.\nIn psychology , this is known as a variable reward .* Slot\nmachines are the most common real-world example. A\ngambler hits the jackpot every now and then but not at any\npredictable interval. The pace of rewards varies. This\nvariance leads to the greatest spike of dopamine, enhances\nmemory recall, and accelerates habit formation.\nVariable rewards won’t create  a craving—that is, you\ncan’t take a reward people are uninterested in, give it to\nthem at a variable interval, and hope it will change their\nmind—but they are a powerful way to amplify the cravings\nwe already experience because they reduce boredom.\nThe sweet spot of desire occurs at a 50/50 split between\nsuccess and failure. Half of the time you get what you want.\nHalf of the time you don’t. Y ou need just enough “winning”\nto experience satisfaction and just enough “wanting” to\nexperience desire. This is one of the beneﬁts of following\nthe Goldilocks Rule. If you’re already interested in a habit,\nworking on challenges of just manageable diﬀiculty is a\ngood way to keep things interesting.\nOf course, not all habits have a variable reward\ncomponent, and you wouldn’t want them to . If Google only\ndelivered a useful search result some of the time, I would\nswitch to a competitor pretty quickly . If Uber only picked\nup half of my trips, I doubt I’d be using that service much\nlonger . And if I ﬂossed my teeth each night and only\nsometimes ended up with a clean mouth, I think I’d skip it.\nVariable rewards or not, no habit will stay interesting\nforever . At some point, everyone faces the same challenge\non the journey of self -improvement: you have to fall in love\nwith boredom.\nWe all have goals that we would like to achieve and\ndreams that we would like to fulﬁll, but it doesn’t matter\nwhat you are trying to become better at, if you only do the\nwork when it’s convenient or exciting, then you’ll never be\nconsistent enough to achieve remarkable results.\nI can guarantee that if you manage to start a habit and\nkeep sticking to it, there will be days when you feel like\nquitting. When you start a business, there will be days\nwhen you don’t feel like showing up. When you’re at the\ngym, there will be sets that you don’t feel like ﬁnishing.\nWhen it’s time to write, there will be days that you don’t\nfeel like typing. But stepping up when it’s annoying or\npainful or draining to do so, that’s what makes the\ndiﬀerence between a professional and an amateur .\nProfessionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get\nin the way . Professionals know what is important to them\nand work toward it with purpose; amateurs get pulled oﬀ\ncourse by the urgencies of life.\nDavid Cain, an author and meditation teacher ,\nencourages his students to avoid being “fair-weather\nmeditators.” Similarly , you don’t want to be a fair-weather\nathlete or a fair-weather writer or a fair-weather anything.\nWhen a habit is truly important to you, you have to be\nwilling to stick to it in any mood. Professionals take action\neven when the mood isn’t right. They might not enjoy it,\nbut they ﬁnd a way to put the reps in.\nThere have been a lot of sets that I haven’t felt like\nﬁnishing, but I’ve never regretted doing the workout. There\nhave been a lot of articles I haven’t felt like writing, but\nI’ve never regretted publishing on schedule. There have\nbeen a lot of days I’ve felt like relaxing, but I’ve never\nregretted showing up and working on something that was\nimportant to me.\nThe only way to become excellent is to be endlessly\nfascinated by doing the same thing over",

    "text": "its become ordinary , we start derailing our progress to\nseek novelty . Perhaps this is why we get caught up in a\nnever-ending cycle, jumping from one workout to the next,\none diet to the next, one business idea to the next. As soon\nas we experience the slightest dip in motivation, we begin\nseeking a new strategy—even if the old one was still\nworking. As Machiavelli noted, “ Men desire novelty to such\nan extent that those who are doing well wish for a change\nas much as those who are doing badly .”\nPerhaps this is why many of the most habit-forming\nproducts are those that provide continuous forms of\nnovelty . Video games provide visual novelty . Porn provides\nsexual novelty . Junk foods provide culinary novelty . Each of\nthese experiences oﬀer continual elements of surprise.\nIn psychology , this is known as a variable reward .* Slot\nmachines are the most common real-world example. A\ngambler hits the jackpot every now and then but not at any\npredictable interval. The pace of rewards varies. This\nvariance leads to the greatest spike of dopamine, enhances\nmemory recall, and accelerates habit formation.\nVariable rewards won’t create  a craving—that is, you\ncan’t take a reward people are uninterested in, give it to\nthem at a variable interval, and hope it will change their\nmind—but they are a powerful way to amplify the cravings\nwe already experience because they reduce boredom.\nThe sweet spot of desire occurs at a 50/50 split between\nsuccess and failure. Half of the time you get what you want.\nHalf of the time you don’t. Y ou need just enough “winning”\nto experience satisfaction and just enough “wanting” to\nexperience desire. This is one of the beneﬁts of following\nthe Goldilocks Rule. If you’re already interested in a habit,\nworking on challenges of just manageable diﬀiculty is a\ngood way to keep things interesting.\nOf course, not all habits have a variable reward\ncomponent, and you wouldn’t want them to . If Google only\ndelivered a useful search result some of the time, I would\nswitch to a competitor pretty quickly . If Uber only picked\nup half of my trips, I doubt I’d be using that service much\nlonger . And if I ﬂossed my teeth each night and only\nsometimes ended up with a clean mouth, I",

This\nvariance leads to the greatest spike of dopamine, enhances\nmemory recall, and accelerates habit formation.\nVariable rewards won’t create  a craving—that is, you\ncan’t take a reward people are uninterested in, give it to\nthem at a variable interval, and hope it will change their\nmind—but they are a powerful way to amplify the cravings\nwe already experience because they reduce boredom.\nThe sweet spot of desire occurs at a 50/50 split between\nsuccess and failure. Half of the time you get what you want.\nHalf of the time you don’t. Y ou need just enough “winning”\nto experience satisfaction and just enough “wanting” to\nexperience desire. This is one of the beneﬁts of following\nthe Goldilocks Rule. If you’re already interested in a habit,\nworking on challenges of just manageable diﬀiculty is a\ngood way to keep things interesting.\nOf course, not all habits have a variable reward\ncomponent, and you wouldn’t want them to . If Google only\ndelivered a useful search result some of the time, I would\nswitch to a competitor",

You have\nto fall in love with boredom.\nChapter Summary\nThe Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience\npeak motivation when working on tasks that are right\non the edge of their current abilities.\nThe greatest threat to success is not failure but\nboredom.\nAs habits become routine, they become less interesting\nand less satisfying. W e get bored.\nAnyone can work hard when they feel motivated. It’s\nthe ability to keep going when work isn’t exciting that\nmakes the diﬀerence.\nProfessionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life\nget in the way.",

You have\nto fall in love with boredom.\nChapter Summary\nThe Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience\npeak motivation when working on tasks that are right\non the edge of their current abilities.\nThe greatest threat to success is not failure but\nboredom.\nAs habits become routine, they become less interesting\nand less satisfying. W e get bored.\nAnyone can work hard when they feel motivated. It’s\nthe ability to keep going when work isn’t exciting that\nmakes the diﬀerence.\nProfessionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life\nget in the way.",

You have\nto fall in love with boredom.\nChapter Summary\nThe Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience\npeak motivation when working on tasks that are right\non the edge of their current abilities.\nThe greatest threat to success is not failure but\nboredom.\nAs habits become routine, they become less interesting\nand less satisfying. W e get bored.\nAnyone can work hard when they feel motivated. It’s\nthe ability to keep going when work isn’t exciting that\nmakes the diﬀerence.\nProfessionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life\nget in the way.",
