APPENDIX
A Reader’s Guide to Using These Ideas
The difﬁ  cult thing about studying the science of habits is that most 
people, when they hear about this ﬁ  eld of research, want to know 
the secret formula for quickly changing any habit. If scientists have discovered how these patterns work, then it stands to reason that they must have also found a recipe for rapid change, right?
If only it were that easy.It’s not that formulas don ’t exist. The problem is that there isn ’t 
one formula for changing habits. There are thousands.
Individuals and habits are all different, and so the speciﬁ  cs of 
diagnosing and changing the patterns in our lives differ from per-son to person and behavior to behavior. Giving up cigarettes is dif-ferent than curbing overeating, which is different from changing how you communicate with your spouse, which is different from how you prioritize tasks at work. What’s more, each person ’s habits are driven by different cravings.
As a result, this book doesn ’t contain one prescription. Rather, I

hoped to deliver something else: a framework for understanding 
how habits work and a guide to experimenting with how they might change. Some habits yield easily to analysis and inﬂ  uence. Others 
are more complex and obstinate, and require prolonged study. And for others, change is a process that never fully concludes.
But that doesn ’t mean it can ’t occur. Each chapter in this book 
explains a different aspect of why habits exist and how they func-tion. The framework described in this appendix is an attempt to distill, in a very basic way, the tactics that researchers have found for diagnosing and shaping habits within our own lives. This isn ’t meant to be comprehensive. This is merely a practical guide, a place to start. And paired with deeper lessons from this book’s chapters, it’s a manual for where to go next.
Change might not be fast and it isn ’t always easy. But with time 
and effort, almost any habit can be reshaped.
THE FRAMEWORK:
• Identify the routine• Experiment with rewards• Isolate the cue• Have a plan
STEP ONE: IDENTIFY THE ROUTINE
The MIT researchers in Chapter One discovered a simple neuro-
logical loop at the core of every habit, a loop that consists of three parts: A cue, a routine and a reward.
Routine
Reward Cue

Appendix ● 277
To understand your own habits, you need to identify the compo-
nents of your loops. Once you have diagnosed the habit loop of a particular behavior, you can look for ways to supplant old vices with new routines.
As an example, let’s say you have a bad habit, like I did when I 
started researching this book, of going to the cafeteria and buying a chocolate chip cookie every afternoon. Let’s say this habit has caused you to gain a few pounds. In fact, let’s say this habit has caused you to gain exactly 8 pounds, and that your wife has made a few pointed com-ments. You’ve tried to force yourself to  stop— you even went so far as to put a  post- it on your computer that reads “NO MORE COOKIES”.
But every afternoon you manage to ignore that note, get up, wan-
der towards the cafeteria, buy a cookie and, while chatting with col-leagues around the cash register, eat it. It feels good, and then it feels bad. Tomorrow, you promise yourself, you’ll muster the will-power to resist. Tomorrow will be different.
But tomorrow, the habit takes hold again.How do you start diagnosing and then changing this behavior? 
By ﬁ guring out the habit loop. And the ﬁ  rst step is to identify the 
routine. In this cookie  scenario— as with most  habits— the routine is the most obvious aspect: it’s the behavior you want to change. Your routine is that you get up from your desk in the afternoon, walk to the cafeteria, buy a chocolate chip cookie and eat it while chatting with friends. So that’s what you put into the loop:
Routine
Reward Cue

Next, some less obvious questions: What’s the cue for this rou-
tine? Is it hunger? Boredom? Low blood sugar? That you need a break before plunging into another task?
And what’s the reward? The cookie itself? The change of scen-
ery? The temporary distraction? Socializing with colleagues? Or the burst of energy that comes from that blast of sugar?
To ﬁ gure this out, you’ll need to do a little experimentation.
STEP TWO: EXPERIMENT WITH REWARDS
Rewards are powerful because they satisfying cravings. But we’re 
often not conscious of the cravings that drive our behaviors. When the Febreze marketing team discovered that consumers desired a fresh scent at the end of a cleaning ritual, for example, they had found a craving that no one even knew existed. It was hiding in plain sight. Most cravings are like this: obvious in retrospect, but incredibly hard to see when we are under their sway.
To ﬁ gure out which cravings are driving particular habits, it’s 
useful to experiment with different rewards. This might take a few days, or a week, or longer. During that period, you shouldn ’t feel any pressure to make a real  change— think of yourself as a scientist in the data collection stage.
On the ﬁ  rst day of your experiment, when you feel the urge to go 
to the cafeteria and buy a cookie, adjust your routine so it delivers a different reward. For instance, instead of walking to the cafeteria, go outside, walk around the block, and then go back to your desk with-out eating anything. The next day, go to the cafeteria and buy a donut, or a candy bar, and eat it at your desk. The next day, go to the cafeteria, buy an apple, and eat it while chatting with your friends. Then, try a cup of coffee. Then, instead of going to the cafeteria, walk over to your friend’s ofﬁ  ce and gossip for a few minutes and go 
back to your desk.
You get the idea. What you choose to do instead  of buying a cookie 
Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   278 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   278 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/11   12:02 PM

isn ’t important. The point is to test different hypotheses to deter-
mine which craving is driving your routine. Are you craving the cookie itself, or a break from work? If it’s the cookie, is it because you’re hungry? (In which case the apple should work just as well.) Or is it because you want the burst of energy the cookie provides? (And so the coffee should sufﬁ  ce.) Or, are you wandering up to the 
cafeteria as an excuse to socialize, and the cookie is just a conve-nient excuse? (If so, walking to someone’s desk and gossiping for a few minutes should satisfy the urge.)
As you test four or ﬁ  ve different rewards, you can use an old trick 
to look for patterns: After each activity, jot down on a piece of paper the ﬁ  rst three things that come to mind when you get back to your 
desk. They can be emotions, random thoughts, reﬂ  ections on how 
you’re feeling, or just the ﬁ  rst three words that pop into your head.
RELAXEDSAW
FLOWERSNOT
HUNGRY
Then, set an alarm on your watch or computer for 15 minutes. 
When it goes off, ask yourself: do you still feel the urge for that cookie?
The reason why it’s important to write down three  things— even 
if they are meaningless  words— is twofold. First, it forces a momen-tary awareness of what you are thinking or feeling. Just as Mandy, the nail biter in Chapter 3, carried around a note card ﬁ  lled with 
hash marks to force her into awareness of her habitual urges, so writing three words forces a moment of attention. What’s more, studies show that writing down a few words helps in later recalling what you were thinking at that moment. At the end of the experi-ment, when you review your notes, it will be much easier to remem-ber what you were thinking and feeling at that precise instant, because your scribbled words will trigger a wave of recollection.

And why the 15-minute alarm? Because the point of these tests 
is to determine the reward you’re craving. If, ﬁ  fteen minutes after 
eating a donuts, you still feel an urge to get up and go to the cafete-
ria, then your habit isn ’t motivated by a sugar craving. If, after gos-siping at a colleague’s desk, you still want a cookie, then the need for human contact isn ’t what’s driving your behavior.
On the other hand, if ﬁ  fteen minutes after chatting with a friend, 
you ﬁ  nd it easy to get back to work, then you’ve identiﬁ  ed the 
 reward— temporary distraction and  socialization— that your habit sought to satisfy.
By experimenting with different rewards, you can isolate what 
you are actually craving, which is essential in redesigning the habit.
Routine
Reward Cue
Once you’ve ﬁ  gured out the routine and the reward, what re-
mains is identifying the cue.
STEP THREE: ISOLATE THE CUE
About a decade ago, a psychologist at the University of Western On-
tario tried to answer a question that had bewildered social scientists for years: Why do some eyewitnesses of crimes misremember what they see, while other recall events accurately?
The recollections of eyewitnesses, of course, are incredibly im-
portant. And yet studies indicate that eyewitnesses often misre-
Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   280 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   280 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/11   12:02 PM
member what they observe. They insist that the thief was a man, for 
instance, when she was wearing a skirt; or that the crime occurred at dusk, even though police reports say it happened at 2:00 in the afternoon. Other eyewitnesses, on the other hand, can remember the crimes they’ve seen with  near- perfect recall.
Dozens of studies have examined this phenomena, trying to de-
termine why some people are better eyewitnesses than others. Re-searchers theorized that some people simply have better memories, or that a crime that occurs in a familiar place is easier to recall. But those theories didn ’t test  out— people with strong and weak memo-ries, or more and less familiarity with the scene of a crime, were equally liable to misremember what took place.
The psychologist at the University of Western Ontario took a dif-
ferent approach. She wondered if researchers were making a mis-take by focusing on what questioners and witnesses had said, rather than how they were saying it. She suspected there were subtle cues 
that were inﬂ  uencing the questioning process. But when she 
watched videotape after videotape of witness interviews, looking for these cues, she couldn ’t see anything. There was so much activity in each  interview— all the facial expressions, the different ways the questions were posed, the ﬂ  uctuating  emotions— that she couldn ’t 
detect any patterns.
So she came up with an idea: She made a list of a few elements 
she would focus  on— the questioners’ tone, the facial expressions of the witness, and how close the witness and the questioner were sit-ting to each other. Then, she removed any information that would distract her from those elements. She turned down the volume on the television so, instead of hearing words, all she could detect was the tone of the questioner’s voice. She taped a sheet of paper over the questioner’s face, so all she could see was the witnesses’ expressions. She held a tape measure to the screen to measure their distance from each other.
And once she started studying these speciﬁ  c elements, patterns Appendix ● 281
Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   281 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   281 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/11   12:02 PM
282 ● Appendix
leapt out. She saw that witnesses who misremembered facts usually 
were questioned by cops who used a gentle, friendly tone. When witnesses smiled more, or sat closer to the person asking the ques-tions, they were more likely to misremember.
In other words, when environmental cues said “we are friends”—a 
gentle tone, a smiling  face— the witnesses were more likely to misre-member what had occurred. Perhaps it was because, subconsciously, those friendship cues triggered a habit to please the questioner.
But the importance of this experiment is that those same tapes 
had been watched by dozens of other researchers. Lots of smart peo-ple had seen the same patterns, but no one had recognized them before. Because there was too much information in each tape to see 
a subtle cue.
Once the psychologist decided to focus on only three categories 
of behavior, however, and eliminate the extraneous information, the patterns leapt out.
Our lives are the same way. The reason why it is so hard to iden-
tify the cues that trigger our habits is because there is too much in-formation bombarding us as our behaviors unfold. Ask yourself, do you eat breakfast at a certain time each day because you are hungry? Or because the clock says 7:30? Or because your kids have started eating? Or because you’re dressed, and that’s when the breakfast habit kicks in?
When you automatically turn your car left while driving to work, 
what triggers that behavior? A street sign? A particular tree? The knowledge that this is, in fact, the correct route? All of them to-gether? When you’re driving your kid to school, and you ﬁ  nd that 
you’ve absentmindedly started taking the route to  work— rather than to the  school— what caused the mistake? What was the cue that caused the ‘drive to work’ habit to kick in, rather than the ‘drive to school’ pattern?
To identify a cue amid the noise, we can use the same system as 
the psychologist: Identify categories of behaviors ahead of time to 
Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   282 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   282 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/11   12:02 PM

scrutinize in order to see patterns. Luckily, science offers some help 
in this regard. Experiments have shown that almost all habitual cues ﬁ t into one of ﬁ  ve categories:
Location
TimeEmotional StateOther PeopleImmediately preceding action
So, if you’re trying to ﬁ  gure out the cue for the ‘going to the caf-
eteria and buying a chocolate chip cookie’ habit, you write down ﬁ  ve 
things the moment the urge hits (these are my actual notes from when I was trying to diagnose my habit):
Where are you? (sitting at my desk)
What time is it? (3:36 pm)What’s your emotional state? (bored)Who else is around? (no one)What action preceded the urge? (answered an email)
The next day:Where are you? (walking back from the copier)
What time is it? (3:18 pm)What’s your emotional state? (happy)Who else is around? (Jim from Sports)What action preceded the urge? (made a photocopy)
The third day:Where are you? (conference room)
What time is it? (3:41 pm)

What’s your emotional state? (tired, excited about the project 
I’m working on)
Who else is around? (editors who are coming to this meeting)What action preceded the urge? (I sat down because the 
meeting is about to start)
Three days in, it was pretty clear which cue was triggering my 
cookie  habit— I felt an urge to get a snack at a certain time of day. I had already ﬁ  gured out, in step two, that it wasn ’t hunger driving my 
behavior. The reward I was seeking was a temporary  distraction— the kind that comes from gossiping with a friend. And the habit, I now knew, was triggered between 3:00 and 4:00.
Routine
Reward Cue
STEP FOUR: HAVE A PLAN
Once you’ve ﬁ  gured out your habit  loop— you’ve identiﬁ  ed the re-
ward driving your behavior, the cue triggering it, and the routine  itself— you can begin to shift the behavior. You can change to a bet-ter routine by planning for the cue, and choosing a behavior that delivers the reward you are craving. What you need is a plan.
In the prologue, we learned that a habit is a choice that we delib-
erately make at some point, and then stop thinking about, but con-tinue doing, often every day.
Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   284 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   284 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/11   12:02 PM
Appendix ● 285
Put another way, a habit is a formula our brain automatically fol-
lows: When I see CUE, I will do ROUTINE in order to get a REWARD.
To  re- engineer that formula, we need to begin making choices 
again. And the easiest way to do this, according to study after study, is to have a plan. Within psychology, these plans are known as ‘im-plementation intentions.’
Take, for instance, my  cookie- in- the- afternoon habit. By using 
this framework, I learned that my cue was roughly 3:30 in the after-noon. I knew that my routine was to go to the cafeteria, buy a cookie and chat with friends. And, through experimentation, I had learned that it wasn ’t really the cookie I  craved— rather, it was a moment of distraction and the opportunity to socialize.
So, I wrote a plan:
At 3:30, every day, I will walk to a friend’s desk 
and talk for 10 minutes.
To make sure I remembered to do this, I set the alarm on my 
watch for 3:30.
It didn ’t work immediately. There were some days I was too busy 
and ignored the alarm, and then fell off the wagon. Other times it seemed like too much work to ﬁ  nd a friend willing to  chat— it was 
easier to get a cookie, and so I gave in to the urge. But on those day that I abided by my  plan— when my alarm went off, I forced myself to walk to a friend’s desk and chat for 10  minutes— I found that I ended the workday feeling better. I hadn ’t gone to the cafeteria, I hadn ’t eat a cookie, and I felt ﬁ  ne. Eventually, it got be automatic: 
when the alarm rang, I found a friend, and ended the day feeling a small, but real, sense of accomplishment. After a few weeks, I hardly thought about the routine anymore. And when I couldn ’t ﬁ  nd any-
one to chat with, I went to the cafeteria and bought tea and drank it with friends.
Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   285 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   285 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/11   12:02 PM
That all happened about six months ago. I don ’t have my watch 
 anymore— I lost it at some point. But at about 3:30 everyday, I ab-sentmindedly stand up, look around the newsroom for someone to talk to, spend 10 minutes gossiping about the news, and then go back to my desk. It occurs almost without me thinking about it. It has become a habit.286 ● Appendix
Routine
Reward Cue
Obviously, changing some habits can be more difﬁ  cult. But this 
framework is a place to start. Sometimes change takes a long time. Sometimes it requires repeated experiments and failures. But once you understand how a habit  operates— once you diagnose the cue, the routine and the  reward— you gain power over it.
