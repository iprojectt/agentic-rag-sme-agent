The Pomodoro Technique has been successfully applied in various types of activities: 
organizing work and study habits, writing books, drafting technical reports, preparing 
presentations, and managing projects, meetings, ev ents, conferences, and training courses. Here 
are some observations that have emerged from the experience of people and teams who have 
applied the Pomodoro Technique. 
3.1 Learning Time 
It takes no time at all to apply the Pomodo ro Technique. Mastering the Technique takes from 
seven to twenty days of constant application. If used in pairs or teams, it’s easier to implement 
the technique consistently. 
 
Note  Experience shows that applying the Technique in teams or organizing work in pairs results 
in less learning time and more consistent results. In these cases, each pair works with their own 
Pomodoro. 
 
3.2 The Length of the Pomodoro 
In terms of how long a Pomodoro lasts, two forces have to be kept in balance to maximize 
effectiveness: 
! The Pomodoro has to represent an effective atomic measure of work. In other words, the 
Pomodoro has to measure equal units of continuous effort; as such these units are 
comparable with others. The pr oblem is that, as everyone knows, all time is not equal in 
terms of the output of effort. All months aren’t equal: December is shorter in terms of 
number of productive days and so is August in Mediterranean countries. Likewise, all the 
weeks in a month aren’t equal: we don’t give  the same effort every single week. All the 
days in a week aren’t equal: some days you can work 8 hours, others only 5 if you need to 
travel or go to the dentist; in still other days you may work 10 or 12 hours (less often, 
hopefully). Even all the hours in a day aren’t equal: not ev ery hour produces the same 
amount of effort, mostly because of interruptio ns. As a unit of measure, much smaller time 
intervals such as 10 minutes might not be interrupted, but they don’t allow us to achieve 
appreciable results, and tracking becomes much too intrusive. So as far as this first force, 
half an hour seems to be ideal. 
! The Pomodoro has to encourage consciousness, concentration, and clear-minded thinking. 
It’s been proven that 20- to 45-minute time intervals can maximize our attention and mental 
activity, if followed by a short break (15).  
In light of these two forces, we’ve come to consider the ideal Pomodoro as 20 – 35 
minutes long, 40 minutes at the most. Experience shows that the Pomodoro Technique works 
best with 30-minute time periods. 
  
Note   In various work groups which experimented with the Pomodoro Technique in mentoring 
activities, each team was allowed to choose the length of their own Pomodoro on the condition 
that this choice had to be based on observations regarding effectiveness. Generally, the teams 
started off with hour-long Pomodoros (25 minutes seemed too short at first), then moved to 2 
hours, then down to 45 minutes, then 10, till they finally settled on 30 minutes. 
 
3.3 Varying the Length of Breaks 
The length of breaks depends on the how tired you feel. Breaks at the end of a set should last 
from 15 to 30 minutes. For example, if you’ve kept up an intense rhythm throughout the whole 
day, at the end of the next to last set of Po modoros your break will natu rally last 25 minutes. If 
The Pomodoro Technique 25 
 
 
© Francesco Cirillo 19/10/2006 you have to solve a very complicated problem, you’ll need a 25-minute break between every 
set. If you’re especially tired, it’s possible and even beneficial to lengthen breaks between sets 
every so often. But breaks that consistently exceed 30 minutes risk interrupting  the rhythm 
between sets of Pomodoros. More importantly, this sets off an alarm signaling the need for rest 
and free time!  
 I t  w o u l d  b e  a  s e r i o u s  m i s t a k e  t o  t a k e  s h o r t e r  b r e a k s  b e t w e e n  s e t s  b e c a u s e  y o u ’ r e  u n d e r  
pressure. Your mind needs time to integrate and get ready to receive new information to solve 
the upcoming problems in the next Pomodoro. Taking a shorter break because you’re in a rush 
could lead to a mental block in finding solutions. 
 
Note   For beginners, once the last Pomodoro in the set of four is up, it’s a good idea to set the 
timer for 25 minutes and start the break. The aim he re isn’t to rigidly impose 25 minutes, but to 
ensure you don’t go over 30 minutes of break time. This should be done only at the beginning. 
In time, you’ll realize how tired you are and understand when you’re refreshed and ready to 
start again. 
 
The same can be said for breaks between Pomodoros, which should be no less than 3-5 
minutes. When you’re especially tired, you can stop working for up to 10 minutes. Remember, 
though, that downtime between Pomodoros that consistently lasts more than 5-10 minutes risks 
breaking the rhythm between Pomodoros. It would be better to finish the current set and take a 
15-30 minute break. The best way to manage your resources is to work strategically, first 
increasing the breaks between sets, and then ex tending the breaks between Pomodoros, if need 
be.  
The most fitting metaphor for managing breaks is long-distance runners. At the start of 
the marathon, they know they have the energy to run faster, but they also know their limits and 
the difficulty of the challenge ahead. They manage  their resources to achieve the best result at 
the finish line. 
3.4 A Different Perception of Time 
The first benefit that comes from applying the Pomodoro Technique, which is already apparent 
in the first few days, is sharpe r focus and concentration that comes from a different perception 
of time. This new perception of time that passes seems to elicit the following sensations: 
1. The first 25-minute Pomodoros seem to pass more slowly.  
2. After a few days of constant application of the Pomodoro, users say they can actually feel 
the mid-way point of the 25 minutes. 
3. By the end of the first week of constant ap plication of the Pomodoro, users say they can 
actually feel when 5 minutes are left on the Pomodoro. In fact, many people report having 
some sense of fatigue during these final minutes. 
We can stimulate this ability to feel time in a different way by means of a series of 
exercises which serve to enhance consciousness of passing time among Pomodoro users. This 
different awareness of the passage of time seems to lead Pomodoro users to a higher level of 
concentration in performing the activity at hand. 
3.5 Sounds of the Pomodoro 
The Pomodoro emits two sounds: it ticks and it rings (after 25 minutes). As regards these 
sounds, there are several things to consider fro m two different perspectives: Pomodoros users, 
and people sharing the same work space with Pomodoro users. 
3.5.1   People W ho Use the Pomodoro  
Let’s first consider Pomodoro users. When th ey start applying the Pomodoro Technique, the 
ticking and ringing can be annoying. There are various ways to make these sounds softer, but 
experience shows that in time (even with just a few days of constant application) two things 
happen:  
! The ticking becomes a calming sound. “It’s ticking and I’m working and everything’s fine.” 
The Pomodoro Technique 26 
 
 
© Francesco Cirillo 19/10/2006 ! After a while, users don’t even hear the ring beca use their level of concentration is so high. 
In fact, not hearing the Pomodoro ring actually becomes a real problem in some cases. 
Clearly the different sensations that are elicit ed by the same sounds are signs of a profound 
change in the perception of time that passes. 
3.5.2   People Who are Subject to the Pomodoro  
Now consider people who have to “put up with” the Pomodoro. This situation would arise when 
the Technique is used in a shared space, for exam ple study halls at a university or an open space 
work environment. To respect the people who don’t use the Pomodoro, a number of solutions 
have been tested. In order of effectiveness, th ere are: watches that count down 25 minutes and 
then flash or beep softly; cell phones with softwa re applications that vibrate or make the display 
flash (for example the PomodoroMobile by XPLabs); kitchen timers with muted rings; 
Pomodoro computer software, aka soft-Pomodoro (first among these is the JTomato by Bruno 
Bossola). The ticking and ringing of several Pomodoros in an environment where a team is 
using the Pomodoro Technique isn’t considered bothersome.  
3.6 Shapes of the Pomodoro 
Obviously, the kitchen timer you use doesn’t have to be shaped like a tomato. Apples, pears, 
oranges, toasters, cooks, spheres, and UFOs: the market for timers is a varied as it is upbeat. 
Choosing your own Pomodoro (or we should say timer) makes the Technique more enjoyable 
and more accessible. 
3.7 Ring Anxiety 
With the first few Pomodoros when learning the Technique, there may be some anxiety from 
the feeling of being controlled by the Pomodoro. Experience shows that this feeling mainly 
emerges in two cases: 
! among people who are not used to self-discipline 
! among people who are very oriented toward achieving results 
In both cases, it will prove difficult to concentrate on the primary objective of the 
Technique: empowering each person to improve his or her work or study process through self-
observation.  
For people who aren’t used to self-discipline, ring anxiety generally comes from the 
fear that the Pomodoro Technique might be used to externally monitor their progress. It’s 
important to stress that the aim of the Technique is not to carry out any sort of external analysis 
or control. With the Pomodoro Technique, ther e is no inspector who monitors workers’ hours 
and methods in a Tayloristic fashion. The Po modoro Technique mustn’t be misconstrued as a 
form of this kind of external control. Instead, the Pomodoro Technique was created to satisfy 
the personal need to improve, and it has to be applied spontaneously. 
Cases of results-oriented people are more common. If every tick seems like an 
invitation to work quickly, if every tock repeats the question, “Am I going fast enough?” these 
are signs of full immersion in what we might call the Becoming  Syndrome . And today this is 
quite common. The underlying fear people have here is usually the inability to demonstrate their 
effectiveness as fully as they’d like to others and to themselves. The Pomodoro is a method for 
comparison, if not with others then at the leas t with themselves, and every tick and tock seems 
to reveal their lack of ability. Under pressure fro m time that passes, they look for shortcuts, but 
this isn’t the way to go faster; shortcuts lead to defects and interruptions which feed into their 
fear of time in a vicious circle. How can they co me to hear the ticking as a calming sound? The 
idea, the solution might be just around the corner with the next tick, but they’ll miss it if they 
keep thinking how fast time is passing.  
The first thing to learn with the Pomodoro Technique is that seeming fast isn’t 
important, reaching the point of actually being fast is. You do this by learning to measure 
yourself, observe how you work, and develop the value of continuity. This is why the first 
objective to achieve with the Pomodoro Technique is simply to mark down the Pomodoros 
you’ve done. 
The Pomodoro Technique 27 
 
 
© Francesco Cirillo 19/10/2006 If it takes four Pomodoros to draft a simple two-page review, it’s not important that you 
expected to finish in two Pomodoros, or that you want to show everyone that you can finish in 
two Pomodoros. What’s important is to find out how to go from four to two. 
The initial challenge is knowing how to an alyze how you work on the basis of test 
measurements collected every 30 minutes and not having expectations as to the result. Simply 
work, track, observe, and change in order to improve, if need be. Once this point is understood, 
the ticking starts to have a different sound. You need to concentrate to be fast.  
The next step is to estimate and – why not? – even challenge yourself to succeed in 
completing a given activity within the estimated time. This is one of the rules of the game for 
the Pomodoro Technique; but never take shortcut s! The Xs marking completed Pomodoros are 
frustrating when they get closer and closer to the last estimated Pomodoro box. But you have to 
be brave and keep on working, staying calm and concentrated, to be successful. Stimulating the 
value of continuity leads to productivity and cr eativity. Every tick of the Pomodoro, if you hear 
it, is an invitation to stay focused, alert, and to continue.  
 
Note  At first, even getting through a single Pomodoro a day without interruptions is an excellent 
result, because it allows you to observe your process. The next day your effort will be focused 
on completing at least one Pomodoro with no interruptions, possibly two or more. With the 
Pomodoro Technique, the number of Pomodoros you finish doesn’t matter so much as the 
pathway to consistently achieving more Pomodoros. This same incremental approach should be 
used when you take up the Pomodoro Technique again after you haven’t used it for some time 
(for example, when you get back from a vacation). In this case, it takes patience and a bit of 
training to consistently reach 10-12 Pomodoros a day. 
 
3.8 Constant Internal Interruptions 
When you perceive internal interruptions as things that can’t be postponed, it becomes difficult 
to complete even a single Pomodoro in a whole day. In these cases, we suggest you set the 
Pomodoro for 25 minutes and force yourself, Pomodoro after Pomodoro, to increase (and more 
importantly never reduce) the time you work non-stop. The final objective is to get to the 25-
minute mark having worked continuously, with no interruptions. “In this Pomodoro I’ve 
managed to work for 10 minutes without interruptions, in the next one I’m going to work no 
less than 10 minutes, maybe even just one minute more.” Results come Pomodoro after 
Pomodoro.  
 
3.9 The Next Pomodoro Will Go Better 
The feeling of having the time to do things and not using it well is often incapacitating. Your 
mind starts wandering from the past to the future: “If I had done that research on Internet 
yesterday, and last week I’d sent that email...How  will I deliver the report by next week?” This 
provokes feelings of guilt and creates anxiety-filled situations. 
The Pomodoro Technique allows you to keep your focus on the current Pomodoro, or 
once that’s done, on the next Pomodoro. Your attention is trained on the here and now, 
emphasizing the search for a concrete way to s timulate the value of continuity and carry out 
activities in the most reasonable order. 
When you feel lost, a Pomodoro can be dedicated to explorationin order to set your 
priorities straight and lay out a new plan. If your ideas are clear but something’s missing – 
maybe determination, maybe a bit of courage - wind up the Pomodoro and start working on it, 
without waiting for time. 
People who have the habit of procrastinating say that they benefit from the fact that the 
Pomodoro enables them to concentrate and achieve little things (activities that take 5-7 
Pomodoros worth of effort, at the most), without having to worry about every thing. One 
Pomodoro at a time, one activity at a time, one objective at a time. For personality types with a 
strong tendency to procrastinate, it’s important to realize that the initial objective is to finish one 
Pomodoro: 25 minutes of work on a given activity, without interruptions.

What kind of Pomodoro is most effective: a mechanical timer or a Soft-Pomodoro for the 
computer?  Speaking from experience, the most effective Pomodoro is always the kitchen timer. 
In any case, to guarantee the highest possible effectiveness, the Pomodoro has to meet a number 
of requirements: 
! You have to be able to actually wind it up. The act of winding up the Pomodoro is a 
declaration of your determination to start working on the activity at hand. 
! It has to clearly show how much time is left, and it should make a ticking sound as time 
passes. This is a way we can practice feeling time and staying focused. 
! It should make an audible, easily id entified sound to signal that time’s up. 
What’s more, to mark the end of a Pomodoro or to eliminate a finished activity from the To Do 
Today Sheet, Pomodoro practitioners should use expl icit gestures. For this reason it’s better if 
these aren’t automated. 
3.11 Improving Estimates  
One of the more tangible results that can be attained with the Pomodoro Technique involves 
improving the ability to estimate. This develops along two pathways: 
! Improvement of quantitative estimates by reducing the error between estimated Pomodoros 
and actual Pomodoros. In other words, while planning the day’s tasks, the effort needed to 
complete a given activity can be accurately predicted. Self-observation and 30-minute 
measurements are the basis for more exact estim ates. Experience shows that a positive sign 
of improvement in estimation is when the num ber of cases of underestimation is equal to 
the number of cases of overestimation. A strategy oriented toward systematic 
overestimation or underestimation does not lead to quantitative improvement. Learning to 
estimate is essential in order to be effective. 
! Improvement of qualitative estimates by reducing the number of activities that weren’t 
included in the planning phase. In other words, while planning the day’s tasks, the number 
and type of activity that actually has to be done can be pinpointed (weak version), or better 
still the specific set of activities that serve to achieve the given objective with the least 
possible effort can be identified (strong version). Overall underestimation happens when we 
don’t correctly identify the activities that have to be done, or we don’t realize that the 
activities we have identified aren’t the most effective. With the Pomodoro Technique, 
unplanned activities are tracked when they emerge. Observing and understanding the nature 
of these activities allows Pomodoro users to hone their forecasting and organizing skills. 
Why does the Pomodoro Technique improve both aspects of estimation? One of the 
common causes of quantitative and qualitative impr ovement is that the activities we measure 
are continually divided up according to the rule: If It Takes More Than 5-7 Pomodoros, Break It 
Down. Smaller  activities are more understandable and easier to estimate, so the margin of error 
shrinks.  Smaller activities (but not too small) enable us to recognize simpler solutions. In fact, 
the aim of breaking down activities should never be simply to divide them up as far as possible. 
Instead, the point is to identify incremental paths which have the lowest possible complexity. 
3.12 Motivation and the Pomodoro 
With the Pomodoro Technique, three factors contribute to boosting personal motivation: 
! Completing several activities a day that aren’t too simple or too complex (Rule: If it Takes 
More than 5-7 Pomodoros, Break It Down.), which serve to reach your objective (13). 
! Directly influencing personal improvement on a day to day basis. 
! Being aware of how you work/how you’re working thanks to continual observation and 
measurement.

What should you do if you get caught up in a rush, or if you have a case of nerves or a panic 
attack? If you start feeling the anxiety of becoming  a n d  t he  d e a d l i n e  i s  g e t t i n g  c l o s e r  b y  t h e  
second? What should you do in case of total paralysis? That can happen. It’s only human. The 
Pomodoro Technique is extremely useful in these circumstances.  
 F i r s t ,  t a k e  a  l o o k  a t  t h e  s i t u a t i o n .  T r y  t o  u n d e r s t a n d  w h a t  w e n t  w r o n g  d u r i n g  t h e  l a s t  
Pomodoro. If necessary, reorganize activities; be open to new things to include and possible 
innovative strategies for pinpointing essential tasks. Focus on the next Pomodoro. Keep on 
working. Concentration and consciousness lead to speed, one Pomodoro at a time. 
 I f  y o u ’ r e  e s p e c i a l l y  t i r e d ,  y o u  n e e d  t o  o r g a n i z e  s h o r t e r  s e t s  ( f o r  e x a m p l e  t h r e e  
Pomodoros) and take longer breaks between sets. Th e more tired you are, or the more behind or 
panic-stricken you feel, the more important it is to repeat and review rather than to forge ahead 
at all costs. The key objective is never to recover lost time, but instead to be focused on taking 
the next step on your chosen path, which you often - consciously - change.  
 
3.14 The Pomodoro Has a Limit 
The main disadvantage of the Pomodoro Technique is that to reach your goals effectively, you 
need to accept being helped by a little mechanical object. Discontinuing the use of the 
Pomodoro Technique actually diminishes most of the positive effects described above. Though 
you still retain the ability to break down activities incrementally, and you might keep on taking 
short breaks, the discipline ensured by the Pomodoro seems to be the key to maintaining a high 
level of effectiveness. 
3.15 When Not To Use the Pomodoro 
The Pomodoro Technique shouldn’t be used for activities you do in your free time. In fact, 
applying the Pomodoro would make these activities scheduled and goal-oriented.  That’s no 
longer free time. If you decide to read a book simply for leisure, you shouldn’t use the 
Pomodoro Technique; doing so would be taking those Pomodoros away from unscheduled free 
time.
