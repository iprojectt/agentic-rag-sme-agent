Focus On Key Result Areas
“When every physical and mental resource is focused,
one’s power to solve a problem multiplies tremendously.”
Norman Vincent Peale
Why are you on the payroll? This is one of the most important
questions you ever ask and answer, over and over again, throughoutyour career.
As it happens, most people are not sure exactly why they are on the
payroll. But if you are not crystal clear about why it is that you are on
the payroll and what results you have been hired to accomplish, it is
very hard for you to perform at your best, get paid more and
promoted faster.
In its simplest terms, you have been hired to get specific results . A
wage or a salary is a payment for a specific quality and quantity of
work that can be combined with the work of others to create a
product or service that customers are willing to pay for.
Each job can be broken down into about five to seven key result
areas, seldom more. These are the results that you absolutely,
positively have to get to fulfill your responsibilities and make your
maximum contribution to your organization.

PAGE 50Key result areas are similar to the vital functions of the body, such as
blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and brainwave activity.
An absence of any one of these vital functions leads to the death of
the organism. By the same token, your failure to perform in a criticalresult area of your work can lead to the end of your job as well.
The Big Seven in Management and Sales
For example, the key result areas of management are: Planning,
Organizing, Staffing, Delegating, Supervising, Measuring and
Reporting. These are the results that a manager must get to succeed
in his or her area of responsibility. A weakness in any one of theseareas can lead to underachievement and failure as a manager.
The key result areas of salespeople are: Prospecting, Building
Rapport and Trust, Identifying Needs, Presenting Persuasively,Answering Objections, Closing the Sale, and Getting Resales and
Referrals. Poor performance in any one of these key skills leads to
lower sales and sometimes failure as a salesperson.
Whatever you do, there are essential skills that you must have for
you to do your job in an excellent fashion. These demands are
constantly changing. There are core competencies that you have
developed that make it possible for you to do your job in the first
place. But there are always key results that are central to your work
and which determine your success or failure in your job. What are
yours?

PAGE 51A key result area is defined as something for which you are
completely responsible. This means that if you don't do it, it doesn't
get done. A key result area is an activity that is under your control. It
is an output of your work that becomes an input or a contributingfactor to the work of others.
Clarity Is Essential
The starting point of high performance is for you to first of all
identify the key result areas of your work. Discuss them with your
boss. Make a list of your most important output responsibilities and
make sure that the people above you, next to you and below you arein agreement with it.
For example, for a salesperson, opening new accounts is a key result
area. This activity is the key to the entire sales process. Closing a saleis a key result area. When the sale is made, it triggers the activities of
many other people to produce and deliver the product or service.
For a company owner or key executive, negotiating a bank loan is a
key result area. Hiring the right people and delegating effectively are
both key result areas. For a receptionist or secretary, typing a letter or
answering the phone and transferring the caller quickly and
efficiently are defined as key result areas. The employee’s ability to
perform these tasks quickly and efficiently largely determines her
pay and promotability.

PAGE 52Give Yourself a Grade
Once you have determined your key result areas, the second step is
for you to grade yourself on a scale of 1-10 in each of those areas.Where are you strong and where are you weak? Where are yougetting excellent results and where are you underperforming?
Rule: Your weakest key result area sets the height at which you can
use all your other skills and abilities.
This rule says that you could be exceptional in six out of seven key
result areas but really poor in the seventh. And your poorperformance in the seventh area will hold you back and determine
how much you achieve with all your other skills. This weakness will
act as a drag on your effectiveness and be a constant source of frictionand frustration.
For example, delegating is a key result area for a manager. This skill is
the key leverage point that enables a manager to manage, to get resultsthrough others. A manager who cannot delegate properly is held back
from using all his or her other skills at their maximum level of
effectiveness. Poor delegation skills alone can lead to failure in the job.
Poor Performance Produces Procrastination
One of the major reasons for procrastination and delay in the
workplace is that people avoid jobs and activities in those areas
EAT THAT FROG!
PAGE 53where they have performed poorly in the past. Instead of setting a
goal and making a plan to improve in a particular area, most people
avoid that area altogether, which just makes the situation worse.
The reverse of this is that, the better you become in a particular skill
area, the more motivated you will be to perform that function, the
less you will procrastinate and the more determined you will be to
get it finished.
The fact is that everybody has both strengths and weaknesses. Refuse
to rationalize, justify or defend your areas of weakness. Instead,
identify them clearly. Set a goal and make a plan to become verygood in each of those areas. Just think! You may be only one critical
skill away from top performance at your job.
The Great Question
Here is one of the greatest questions you will ever ask and answer:
"What one skill, if I developed and did it in an excellent fashion,
would have the greatest positive impact on my career?"
You should use this question to guide your career for the rest of your
life. Look into yourself for the answer. You usually know what it is.
Ask your boss this question. Ask your coworkers. Ask your friends
and your family. Whatever it is, find out and then go to work to bring
up your performance in this area.
EAT THAT FROG!
PAGE 54The good news is that all business skills are learnable . If anyone else is
excellent in that particular key result area, this is proof that you can
become excellent as well, if you decide to.
One of the fastest and best ways to stop procrastinating and get more
things done faster is for you to become absolutely excellent in your
key result areas. This can be as important as anything else you do in
your life or your career.
Eat That Frog!
1.  Identify the key result areas of your work. What are they? Write
down the key results you have to get to do your job in an excellent
fashion. Give yourself a grade from 1-10 on each one. And then
determine the one key skill that, if you did it in an excellent manner,
would help you the most in your work.
2.  Take this list to your boss and discuss it with him or her. Invite
honest feedback and appraisal. You can only get better when you are
open to the constructive inputs of other people. Discuss your results
with your staff and coworkers. Talk them over with your spouse.
Make a habit of doing this analysis regularly for the rest of your
career. Never stop improving. This decision alone can change your
life.
