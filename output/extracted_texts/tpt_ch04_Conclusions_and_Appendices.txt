© Francesco Cirillo 19/10/2006 4 Conclusions 
In actual fact, the positive effects of the Pomodoro Technique on individual or team 
productivity come from a number of different factors; below an attempt is made to summarize 
them.  
4.1 Inverting the Dependency on Time 
The Pomodoro represents an abstraction of time, a box that can hold and limit becoming  and on 
which time depends, in the end. It’s precisely by breaking and inverting our dependency on 
becoming  t h a t  a  d i f f e r e n t  v i s i o n  o f  t i m e  e m e r g e s .  B y  m e a s u r i n g  o u r s e l v e s  a g a i n s t  a  f i n i t e  
abstraction of time - the Pomodoro - we can succeed in breaking our direct dependency on the 
concept of becoming . 
Specifically, the time-boxing concept together with the typical Pomodororian notion of 
time running backwards (from 25 minutes to  0) generate po sitive tension ( eustress ) which is 
capable of facilitating the decision-making process. In more general terms, this stimulates the  
vital contact you need to assert yourself and at the same time accomplish activities. 
The passage of time is no longer perceived as negative, but positive. Every Pomodoro 
represents the opportunity to im prove, or in crisis situations, to rapidly reorganize. The more 
time passes, the better chance you have to improve your process. The more time passes, the 
more easily activities can be estimated and scheduled. The more time passes, the more the 
feeling of anxiety is assuaged, and in its pla ce come enhanced consciousness, sharper focus on 
the here and now, and a clearer mind in deciding your next move. The result is higher 
productivity. 
Moreover, the same dependency inversion mechanism is applied in the Pomodoro 
Technique to reduce and eliminate interruptions. Th is increases concentrat ion and continuity in 
work, and here too there is a considerable correlated rise in productivity. 
4.2 Regulating Complexity 
We can maximize our motivation by accomplishing several challenging activities every day that 
are neither too complex nor too easy, simply by applying the following rules:  
! If It Lasts More Than 5-7 Pomodoros, Break It Down. 
! If It Lasts Less Than One Pomodoro, Add It Up. 
Less complex activities are usually easier to estimate, so quantitative estimates 
improve. Breaking down activities so they deliver incremental value also bolsters our 
determination to attain our objectives. 
4.3 Detachment 
Frequent breaks with the Pomodoro are essential to achieving more lucid, conscious and 
effective mental capacity with a resulting increase in productivity. It is important to note that in 
many environments there’s a sort of aversion to  b r e a k s ,  a s  i f  t h e y  w e r e  a  s i g n  o f  w e a k n e s s .  
Common wisdom in many companies seems to be: “Real managers start the meeting at 9 AM 
and end at 10 PM and never leave their office.” Th is extreme behavior at work actually reveals 
a tenaciousness that often lays a solid foundation for frustration and working with a lack of 
concentration, and consequently  a lack of effectiveness.

mistakes to correct, and your creative processes are stimulated. Detachment enhances the value 
of continuity.

work situations that don’t improve individual or team effectiveness. Stopping, detaching, and 
observing yourself from the outside enhances awareness of your behavior. Stopping becomes 
synonymous with strength, not weakness. 
4.4 Observation and Continual Feedback 
The Pomodoro Technique represents a method of  comparison every 25 minutes. The first and 
last five minutes of a Pomodoro, which serve to review and repeat what you’ve done, already 
enable you to realize if a certain course of action is effective. Pair work magnifies this positive 
phenomenon more than individual or group work. In the most critical cases, it’s even possible to 
change direction from the very next Pomodoro, rescheduling the activities that need to be done. 
 R e c o r d i n g  d a t a  a t  l e a s t  o n c e  a  d a y ,  w i t h  tracking every 30 minutes, lets us assess the 
effectiveness of our modus operandi  o n  t h e  b a s i s  o f  o b j e c t i v e  m e t r i c s .  B y  o b s e r v i n g  w h a t  
you’ve recorded, you can come to a decision to modify your process, improving the content of 
activities, defining clearer objectives or breaking down activities, identifying and eliminating 
duplicated or unnecessary activity or phases, testing alternative strategies for assembling 
activities while reducing error in qualitative estimates. 
 T h e  c h a n c e  t o  d i r e c t l y  a f f e c t  y o u r  w o r k  o r  s t u d y  p r o c e s s  b y  s t e e r i n g  i t  t o w a r d  
improvement stimulates your personal interest in accomplishing activities by asserting yourself.  
4.5 Sustainable Pace 
Respecting the timetable for work and breaks cont ributes to achieving continuity. To guarantee 
consistently high productivity, in fact, it’s not e ffective to make yourself work or study non-stop 
from morning till night. An industrial machine certainly produces more if it works a long time 
without stopping, but human beings simply don’t function like industrial machines.  
By respecting the schedule for breaks between single Pomodoros and sets of 
Pomodoros, you can work and study while maintaining your pace. You’ll get tired, which is 
only natural, but you won’t become exhausted. In other words, by consciously managing breaks 
and the complexity of content, in time anyone who uses the Pomodoro Technique can come to 
know his or her sustainable pace or physiological rhythm.

Rules  
! A Pomodoro Consists of 25 minutes Plus a Five-Minute Break (§2.1).   
! After Every Four Pomodoros Comes a 15-30 Minute Break (§2.1.2). 
! The Pomodoro Is Indivisible. There are no half or quarter Pomodoros (§2.1). 
! If a Pomodoro Begins, It Has to Ring:  
! If a Pomodoro is interrupted definitively – i.e. the interruption isn’t handled 
(§2.2.2) – it’s considered void, never begun, and it can’t be recorded with an X 
(§2.1.1). 
! If an activity is completed once a Pomodoro has already begun, continue reviewing 
the same activity until the Pomodoro rings (§2.1.3). 
! Protect the Pomodoro (§2.2.3). Inform effectively, negotiate quickly to reschedule the 
interruption, call back the person who interrupted you as agreed. 
! If It Lasts More Than 5-7 Pomodoros, Break It Down (§2.3, §3.11, §4.2). Complex 
activities should be divided into several activities. 
! If It Lasts Less Than One Pomodoro, Add It Up (§2.3, §4.2). Simple tasks can be 
combined. 
! Results Are Achieved Pomodoro after Pomodoro (§3.8). 
! The Next Pomodoro Will Go Better (§3.9). 
 
Glossary 
! Pomodoro . Kitchen timer used to measure 25-minute intervals. The name of the Technique 
comes from the first timer used which was shaped like a tomato (pomodoro in Italian). 
! Time-boxing . With this technique, once a series of activities has been assigned to a given 
time interval, the delivery date for these activities should never change. If necessary, the 
unfinished activities can be reassigned to the following time interval.  
! Qualitative estimation error . This error occurs when all th e activities needed to reach a 
certain goal haven’t been identified. 
! Quantitative estimation error . This error occurs when the estimation of a single activity 
(or set of activities) is higher (overestimation) or lower (und erestimation) than the actual 
effort.
