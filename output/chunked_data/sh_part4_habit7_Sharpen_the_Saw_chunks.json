It's \nrenewing the four dimensions of your nature -- physical, spiritual, mental, and social/emotional. \n   Although different words are used, most philosophie s of life deal either explic itly or implicitly with \nthese four dimensions.  Philosopher Herb Shepherd  describes the healthy balanced life around four \nvalues: perspective (spiritual), autonomy (mental), co nnectedness (social), and tone (physical).  George \nSheehan, the running guru, describes four roles: be ing a good animal (physi cal), a good craftsman \n(mental), a good friend (social), and a saint (spiri tual).

It means exercising all four \ndimensions of our nature, regularly and co nsistently, in wise and balanced ways. \n   To do this, we must be proactive.  Taking time to sharpen the saw is a definite Quadrant II activity, \nand Quadrant II must be acted on.  Quadrant I, because of its urgency, acts on us; it presses upon us \nconstantly.  Personal PC must be pressed upon until it becomes second nature, until it becomes a kind \nof healthy addiction.  Because it's at  the center of our Circle of Influence, no one else can do it for us.  \nWe must do it for ourselves.    This is the single most powerful investment we can ever make in life -- investment in ourselves, in \nthe only instrument we have with wh ich to deal with life and to contribute.  We are the instruments of \nour own performance, and to be effective, we need to  recognize the importance of taking time regularly \nto sharpen the saw in all four ways.  \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n \nThe Physical Dimension     The physical dimension involves caring effectivel y for our physical body -- eating the right kinds of \nfoods, getting sufficient rest and relaxati on, and exercising on a regular basis. \n   Exercise is one of those Quadrant II, high-leverag e activities that most of us don't do consistently \nbecause it isn't urgent.

We're talking about three to six hour s a week -- or a minimum of thirty minutes a day, \nevery other day.  That hardly seems an inordinate amount of time considering the tremendous benefits \nin terms of the impact on the other 162-165 hours of the week.    And you don't need any special equipment to do it .  If you want to go to a gym or a spa to use the \nequipment or enjoy some skill sports such as tennis or  racquetball, that's an added opportunity.  But it \nisn't necessary to sharpen the saw.    A good exercise program is one that you can do in your own home and one that will build your \nbody in three areas: endurance, flexibility, and strength.    Endurance comes from aerobic exercise, from card iovascular efficiency -- the ability of your heart to \npump blood through your body.    Although the heart is a muscle, it cannot be exer cised directly.  It can only  be exercised through the \nlarge muscle groups, particularly the leg muscles.  That's why exercises like rapid walking, running, \nbiking, swimming, cross-country skiin g, and jogging are so beneficial. \n   You are considered minimally fit if you can incr ease your heart rate to at least 100 beats per minute \nand keep it at that level for 30 minutes.    Ideally you should try to raise your heart rate to  at least 60 percent of your maximum pulse rate, the \ntop speed your heart can beat and still pump blood through your body.  Your maximum heart rate is generally accepted to be 220 less your age.  So, if  you are 40, you should aim for an exercise heart rate \nof 108 (220 - 40 = 180 x .6 = 108).  The \"training effect\" is generally considered to be between 72 and 87 \npercent of your personal maximum rate.    Flexibility comes through stretching.  Most experts recommend warming up before and cooling \ndown/stretching after aerobic exercise.  Before, it helps loosen and warm the muscles to prepare for \nmore vigorous exercise.  After, it helps to dissipate th e lactic acid so that you don't feel sore and stiff. \n   Strength comes from muscle resistance exercises -- like simple calisthenics,  push-ups, and sit-ups, \nand from working with weights.  How much emphas is you put on developing strength depends on \nyour situation.  If you're involved in physical la bor or athletic activities, increased strength will \nimprove your skill.  If you have a basically sedentary  job and success in your life-style does not require \na lot of strength, a little toning through calisthenics in  addition to your aerobic and stretching exercises \nmight be sufficient.    I was in a gym one time with a friend of mine who has a Ph. D. in exercise physiology.  He was focusing on building strength.  He asked me to \"s pot\" him while he did some bench presses and told \nme at a certain point he'd ask me to take the weight.  \"But don't take it until I tell you,\" he said firmly. \n   So I watched and waited and prepared to take  the weight.  The weight went up and down, up and \ndown.  And I could see it begin to get harder.  But he  kept going.  He would start to push it up and \nI'd think, \"There's no way he's going to make it.\" But he'd make it.  Then he'd slowly bring it back \ndown and start back up again.   Up and down, up and down. \n   Finally, as I looked at his face, straining with the effort, his blood vessels practically jumping out of \nhis skin, I thought, \"This is going to fall and colla pse his chest.  Maybe I should take the weight.  \nMaybe he's lost control and he does n't even know what he's doing.\" Bu t he'd get it safely down.  Then \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \nhe'd start back up again.  I couldn't believe it\" \n   \"Almost all the benefit of the exercise comes at th e very end, Stephen,\" he replied.  \"I'm trying to \nbuild strength.  And that doesn't happen until the muscle fiber ruptures and the nerve fiber registers \nthe pain.",

And that doesn't happen until the muscle fiber ruptures and the nerve fiber registers \nthe pain.  Then nature overcompensates and with in 48 hours, the fiber is made stronger.\" \n   I could see his point.  It's the same principle that works with emotional muscles as well, such as \npatience.  When you exercise your patience beyond  your past limits, the emotional fiber is broken, \nnature overcompensates, and next time the fiber is stronger.    Now my friend wanted to build muscular strength .  And he knew how to do it.  But not all of us \nneed to develop that kind of strength to be ef fective.  \"No pain, no gain\" has validity in some \ncircumstances, but it is not the essence of an effective exercise program.    The essence of renewing the physical dimension is  to sharpen the saw, to exercise our bodies on a \nregular basis in a way that will preserve and e nhance our capacity to work and adapt and enjoy. \n   And we need to be wise in developing an exer cise program.

His enthusiasm waned; his writing efforts wer e fruitless.  And the situation was growing worse \nday by day.    Finally, he determined to get help from a medical doctor.  Observ ing nothing physically wrong, the \ndoctor asked him if he would be able to follow his instructions for one day.    When Gordon replied that he could, the doctor  told him to spend the following day in the place \nwhere he was happiest as a child.  He could take food , but he was not to talk to anyone or to read or \nwrite or listen to the radio.  He then wrote out four  prescriptions and told him to open one at nine, \ntwelve, three, and six o'clock.    \"Are you serious?\" Gordon asked him.    \"You won't think I'm joking when you get my bill!\" was the reply.    So the next morning, Gordon went to the beach.   As he opened the firs t prescription, he read \n\"Listen carefully.\" He thought the doctor was insane.  How could he listen for three hours? But he had \na\ngreed to follow the doctor's orders, so he listened.  He heard the usual sounds of the sea and the birds.  \nAfter a while, he could hear the other sounds that weren't  so apparent at first.  As he listened, he began \nto think of lessons the sea had taught him as a child -- patience, respec t, an awareness of the \ninterdependence of things.  He bega n to listen to the sounds -- and th e silence -- and to feel a growing \npeace.    At noon, he opened the second slip of paper and read \"Try reaching back.\" \"Reaching back to what?\" \nhe wondered.  Perhaps to childhood, perhaps to memo ries of happy times.  He thought about his past, \nabout the many little moments of joy.  He trie d to remember them with exactness.  And in \nremembering, he found a growing warmth inside.    At three o'clock, he opened the third piece of paper.  Until now, the prescr iptions had been easy to \ntake.

It renews us, it refreshes us, \nparticularly if we recommit to it.    This is why I believe a personal mission st atement is so important.  If we have a deep \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \nunderstanding of our center and our purpose, we ca n review and recommit to it frequently.  In our \ndaily spiritual renewal, we can visualize and \"live ou t\" the events of the day in harmony with those \nvalues.    Religious leader David O. McKay taught, \"The gr eatest battles of life are fought out daily in the \nsilent chambers of the soul.\" If you win the battles th ere, if you settle the issues that inwardly conflict, \nyou feel a sense of peace, a sense of knowing what  you're about.  And you'll find that the Public \nVictories -- where you tend to think cooperatively, to promote the welfare and good of other people, \nand to be genuinely happy for other pe ople's successes -- will follow naturally. \n The Mental Dimension     Most of our mental development and study di scipline comes through form al education.  But as \nsoon as we leave the external discipline of school, many  of us let our minds atrophy.  We don't do any \nmore serious reading, we don't explore new subjects  in any real depth outside our action fields, we \ndon't think analytically, we don't write -- at least no t critically or in a way that tests our ability to \nexpress ourselves in distilled, clear, and concise language.  Instead, we spend our time watching TV.    Continuing surveys indicate that television is on  in most homes some 35 to 45 hours a week.  That's \nas much time as many people put into their jobs, more than most put into school.  It's the most \npowerful socializing influence there is.  And when we watch, we're su bject to all the values that are \nbeing taught through it.  That can powerfully infl uence us in very subtle and imperceptible ways. \n   Wisdom in watching television requires the e ffective self-management of Habit 3, which enables you \nto discriminate and to select the in forming, inspiring, and entertaining programs which best serve and \nexpress your purpose and values.    In our family, we limit television watching to around seven hours a week, an average of about an \nhour a day.  We had a family coun cil at which we talked about it and looked at some of the data \nregarding what's happening in homes because of television.  We found th at by discussing it as a family \nwhen no one was defensive or argumentative, people  started to realize the dependent sickness of \nbecoming addicted to soap operas or to  a steady diet of a particular program. \n   I'm grateful for television and for the many high-quality educat ional and entertainment programs.  \nThey can enrich our lives and contri bute meaningfully to our purposes  and goals.  But there are many \nprograms that simply waste our time and minds and many  that influence us in ne gative ways if we let \nthem.  Like the body, television is a good servant bu t a poor master.  We need to practice Habit 3 and \nmanage ourselves effectively to maximize the use of any resource in accomplishing our missions. \n   Education -- continuing education, continually honing and expanding the mind -- is vital mental renewal.  Sometimes that involves the external discipline of the classroom or systematized study \nprograms; more often it does not.

That's why it is so \nvaluable to read broadly and to expose yourself to great minds.    There's no better way to inform and expand your mind on a regular basis than to get into the habit \nof reading good literature.  That's another high-l everage Quadrant II activity.  You can get into the \nbest minds that are now or that have ever been in the world.  I highly recommend starting with a goal \nof a book a month then a book every two weeks, then  a book a week.  \"The person who doesn't read is \nno better off than the person who can't read.\"  \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n   Quality literature, such as the Great Books,  the Harvard Classics, autobiographies, National \nGeographic and other publications that expand our cu ltural awareness, and current literature in various \nfields can expand our paradigms and sharpen our ment al saw, particularly if we practice Habit 5 as we \nread and seek first to understand.  If we use our own autobiography to make early judgments before \nwe really understand what an author has to say,  we limit the benefits of the reading experience. \n   Writing is another powerful way to sharpen the mental saw.  Keeping a journal of our thoughts, \nexperiences, insights, and learnings promotes mental  clarity, exactness, and context.  Writing good \nletters -- communicating on the deeper level of thoughts, feelings, and ideas rather than on the shallow, superficial level of events -- also  affects our ability to think clearly,  to reason accurately, and to be \nunderstood effectively.    Organizing and planning represent other forms of  mental renewal associated with Habits 2 and 3.  \nIt's beginning with the end in mind and being able me ntally to organize to accomplish that end.  It's \nexercising the visualizing, imagining power of your mind to see the end from the beginning and to see \nthe entire journey, at least in principles, if not in steps.    It is said that wars are won in the general's te nt.  Sharpening the saw in th e first three dimensions -- \nthe physical, the spiritual, and the mental -- is a practice I call the \"Daily Private Victory.\" And I \ncommend to you the simple practice of spending on e hour a day every day doing it -- one hour a day \nfor the rest of your life.    There's no other way you coul d spend an hour that would begin to compare with the Daily Private \nVictory in terms of value and results.  It will affect  every decision, every relationship.  It will greatly \nimprove the quality, the effectiveness, of every other hour of the day, including the depth and \nrestfulness of your sleep.  It will build the long-term physical, spiritua l, and mental strength to enable \nyou to handle difficult challenges in life.    In the words of Phillips Brooks:    Some day, in the years to come, you will be wr estling with the great temptation, or trembling under \nthe great sorrow of your life.  But the real struggle is here, now.  Now it is being decided whether, in \nthe day of your supreme sorrow or temptation, you shall miserably fail or gloriously conquer.  \nCharacter cannot be made except by a steady, long continued process.  The Social/Emotional Dimension     While the physical, spiritual, and mental dimensions are closely related to Habits 1, 2, and 3 -- centered on the principles of personal vision, leadership, and management  -- the social/emotional \ndimension focuses on Habits 4, 5, and 6 -- centered on the principles of interpersonal leadership, \nempathic communication, and creative cooperation.    The social and the emotional dimensions of our liv es are tied together because our emotional life is \nprimarily, but not exclusively, developed out of an d manifested in our relationships with others. \n   Renewing our social/emotional dimension does no t take time in the same sense that renewing the \nother dimensions does.  We can do it in our normal  everyday interactions with other people.  But it \ndefinitely requires exercise.  We may have to push ourselves because many of us have not achieved the \nlevel of Private Victory and the skills of Public Victor y necessary for Habits 4, 5, and 6 to come naturally \nto us in all our interactions.

Suppose we  need to communicate together, to work together, \nto discuss a jugular issue, to accomplish a purpose or  solve a problem.

I come to you and I say, \"I can see that we're approaching this situation \ndifferently.  Why don't we agree to communicate until we can find a solution we bo th feel good about.  \nWould you be willing to do that?\" Most peop le would be willing to say \"yes\" to that. \n   Then I move to Habit 5.  \"Let me listen to you firs t.\" Instead of listening with intent to reply, I listen \nempathically in order to deeply, thoroughly understand your parad igm.  When I can explain your \npoint of view as well as you can, then I focus on communicating my point of view to you so that you \ncan understand it as well.    Based on the commitment to search for a solu tion that we both feel good about and a deep \nunderstanding of each other's points of view, we move  to Habit 6.  We work together to produce Third \nAlternative solutions to our differences that we both recognize are better than th e ones either you or I \nproposed initially.    Success in Habits 4, 5, and 6 is not primarily a matte r of intellect; it's primarily a matter of emotion.  \nIt's highly related to our sense of personal security.    If our personal security comes from sources within  ourselves, then we have the strength to practice \nthe habits of Public Victory.  If we are emotionall y insecure, even though we may be intellectually very \nadvanced, practicing Habits 4, 5, and 6 with people wh o think differently on jugular issues of life can be \nterribly threatening.    Where does intrinsic security come from? It do esn't come from the scripts they've handed us.  It \ndoesn't come from our circumstances or our position.    It comes from within.  It comes from accurat e paradigms and correct principles deep in our own \nmind and heart.  It comes from Insi de-Out congruence, from living a life  of integrity in which our daily \nhabits reflect our deepest values.    I believe that a life of integrity is the most fun damental source of personal worth.  I do not agree \nwith the popular success literature that  says that self-esteem is primarily  a matter of mindset, of attitude \n-- that you can psyche yourself into peace of mind.    Peace of mind comes when your life is in harmon y with true principles an d values and in no other \nway.    There is also the intrinsic security that comes as a result of effective interd ependent living.  There is \nsecurity in knowing that win-win solutions do exist, that life is not always \"either/or,\" that there are \nalmost always mutually beneficial Third Alternatives .  There is security in kn owing that you can step \nout of your own frame of reference without giving it  up, that you can really, deeply understand another \nhuman being.  There is security  that comes when you authentica lly, creatively, and cooperatively \ninteract with other people and really e xperience these interdependent habits. \n   There is intrinsic security that comes from servic e, from helping other people in a meaningful way.  \nOne important source is your work, when you see yourself in a contri butive and creative mode, really \nmaking a difference.  Another source is anonymous service -- no one knows it and no one necessarily \never will.  And that's not the concern; the concern is  blessing the lives of other people.  Influence, not \nrecognition, becomes the motive.    Viktor Frankl focused on the need for meaning and purpose in ou r lives, something that transcends \nour own lives and taps the best en ergies within us",

We can affirm \ntheir proactive nature and treat them as respon sible people.  We can help script them as \nprinciple-centered, value-based, independent, wort hwhile individuals.  And, with the Abundance \nMentality, we realize that giving a positive reflection to others in no way diminishes us.  It increases us \nbecause it increases the opportunities for effe ctive interaction with other proactive people. \n   At some time in your life, you probably had someone believe in you when  you didn't believe in \nyourself.  He or she scripted you.  Did that make a difference in your life.    What if you were a positive scripter, an affirme r, of other people? When they're being directed by \nthe social mirror to take the lower path, you inspire them toward a hi gher path because you believe in \nthem.  You listen to them and empathize with them .  You don't absolve them of responsibility; you \nencourage them to be proactive.    Perhaps you are familiar with the musical, Man of La Mancha.  It's a beautiful story about a \nmedieval knight who meets a woman of the street, a pr ostitute.  She's being validated in her life-style \nby all of the people in her life.    But this poet knight sees something else in he r, something beautiful and lovely.  He also sees her \nvirtue, and he affirms it, over and over again.  He gives her a new name -- Dulcinea -- a new name \nassociated with a new paradigm.    At first, she utterly denies it; her old scripts are overpowering.  She writes him off as a wild-eyed \nfantasizer.  But he is persistent.  He makes contin ual deposits of unconditional love and gradually it \npenetrates her scripting.  It goes down into her true  nature, her potential, an d she starts to respond.  \nLittle by little, she begins to change her life-style.

Viktor Frankl focused on the need for meaning and purpose in ou r lives, something that transcends \nour own lives and taps the best en ergies within us.  The late Dr. Hans Selye, in his monumental \nresearch on stress, basically says that a long, healthy, and happy life is the result of making \ncontributions, of having meaningful projects that are  personally exciting and contribute to and bless the \nlives of others.  His ethic was \"earn thy neighbor's love.    This is the true joy in life -- that being used for a purpose recogniz ed by yourself as a mighty one.  \nThat being a force of nature, instead of a feverish , selfish little clod of ailments and grievances \ncomplaining that the world will not devote itself to  making you happy.

The teachers had treated them as \nthough they were bright, and their energy, their ho pe, their optimism, their excitement had reflected \nhigh individual expectations and worth for those kids.    These teachers were asked what it was like du ring the first few weeks of the term.  \"For some \nreason, our methods weren't working,\" they rep lied.  \"So we had to change our methods.\" The \ninformation showed that the kids wer e bright.  If things weren't workin g well, they figured it had to be \nthe teaching methods.  So they worked on methods.  They were proactive; they worked in their Circle \nof Influence.  Apparent learner disability was nothing more or less than teacher inflexibility. \n   What do we reflect to others about themselves? And how much does that reflection influence their \nlives? We have so much we can invest in the Emotio nal Bank Accounts of other people.  The more we \ncan see people in terms of their unseen potential,  the more we can use our im agination rather than our \nmemory, with our spouse, our children, our co-workers  or employees.  We can refuse to label them -- \nwe can \"see\" them in new fresh ways each time we're with them.  We can help them become \nindependent, fulfilled people capable of deeply satisf ying, enriching, and productive relationships with \nothers.    Goethe taught, \"Treat a man as he is and he will remain as he is.  Treat a man as he can and should \nbe and he will become as he can and should be.\"  Balance in Renewal     The self-renewal process must include balanced renewal in all four dimens ions of our nature: the \nphysical, the spiritual, the mental, and the social/emotional.    Although renewal in each dimension is importan t, it only becomes optima lly effective as we deal \nwith all four dimensions in a wise and balanced wa y.  To neglect any one area negatively impacts the \nrest.    I have found this to be true in organizations as  well as in individual lives .  In an organization, the \nphysical dimension is expressed in economic term s.  The mental or psychological dimension deals \nwith the recognition, development, and use of talent .  The social/emotional dimension has to do with \nhuman relations, with finding meaning through purp ose or contribution and through organizational \nintegrity.    When an organization neglects any one or more  of these areas, it negatively impacts the entire \norganization.  The creative energies that could resu lt in tremendous, positive synergy are instead used \nto fight against the organization and become re straining forces to growth and productivity. \n   I have found organizations whose only thrust is  economic -- to make mo ney.  They usually don't \npublicize that purpose.  They sometimes even public ize something else.  But in their hearts, their only \ndesire is to make money.    Whenever I find this, I also",

This process of continuous improvement is the hallmark of the Total Quality movement and a key to \nJapan's economic ascendancy.  Synergy in Renewal     Balanced renewal is optimally synergetic.  The things you do to sharpen the saw in any one \ndimension have positive impact in  other dimensions because they are so highly interrelated.  Your \nphysical health affects your mental health; your spiritual strength affects your social/emotional \nstrength.  As you improve in one dimension, you in crease your ability in other dimensions as well. \n   The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People create optimum synergy among these dimensions.  \nRenewal in any dimension increases your ability to liv e at least one of the Seven Habits.  And although \nthe habits are sequential, improvement in one habit sy nergetically increases your ability to live the rest. \n   The more proactive you are (Habit 1), the more  effectively you can exercise personal leadership \n(Habit 2) and management (Habit 3) in your life.  The more effectively you ma nage your life (Habit 3), \nthe more Quadrant II renewing activities you can do (Habit 7).  The more you seek first to understand \n(Habit 5), the more effectively you can go for synerg etic win-win solutions (Hab its 4 and 6).  The more \nyou improve in any of the habits that lead to inde pendence (Habits 1, 2, and 3), the more effective you \nwill be in interdependent situatio ns (Habits 4, 5, and 6).  And renewal (Habit 7) is the process of \nrenewing all the habits.    As you renew your physical dimension, you rein force your personal vision (Habit 1), the paradigm \nof your own self-awareness and free will, of proactivity, of knowing that you are free to act instead of being acted upon, to choose your own response to any stimulus.  This is probably the greatest benefit \nof physical exercise.  Each Daily Private Victory makes a deposit in your personal intrinsic security \naccount.    As you renew your spiritual dimension, you re inforce your personal leadership (Habit 2).  You \nincrease your ability to live out of your imaginatio n and conscience instead of only your memory, to \ndeeply understand your innermost paradigms and values , to create within yourself a center of correct \nprinciples, to define your own uniq ue mission in life, to rescript your self to live your life in harmony \nwith correct principles and to",

The Upward Spiral     Renewal is the principle -- an d the process -- that empowers us to  move on an upward spiral of \ngrowth and change, of continuous improvement.    To make meaningful and consistent progress alon g that spiral, we need to consider one other aspect \nof renewal as it applies to the unique human en dowment that directs this upward movement -- our \nconscience.  In the words of Madame de Sta'l, \"The vo ice of conscience is so delicate that it is easy to \nstifle it: but it is also so clear th at it is impossible to mistake it.\" \n   Conscience is the endowment that senses our congruence or disparity with correct principles and \nlifts us toward them -- when it's in shape    Just as the education of nerve and sinew is vital to the excellent athlete and education of the mind is \nvital to the scholar, education of the conscience is vita l to the truly proactive, highly effective person.  \nTraining and educating the conscience, however, requ ires even greater concentration, more balanced \ndiscipline, more consistently honest living.  It requir es regular feasting on inspiring literature, thinking \nnoble thoughts and, above all, living in harmony with its still small voice \n   Just as junk food and lack of exercise can ruin an athlete's condition, thos e things that are obscene, \ncrude, or pornographic can breed an inner darkness that numbs our higher sensibilities and substitutes \nthe social conscience of \"Will I be found out?\" for the natural or divine conscience of \"What is right and \nwrong?\"    In the words of Dag Hammarskjold,    You cannot play with the animal in you with out becoming wholly animal, play with falsehood \nwithout forfeiting your right to truth, play with cr uelty without losing your sensitivity of mind.  He \nwho wants to keep his garden tidy doesn't reserve a plot for weeds.    Once we are self-aware, we must choose purposes and principles to live by; otherwise the vacuum \nwill be filled, and we will lose our self-awareness an d become like groveling animals who live primarily \nfor survival and propagation.  People who exist on th at level aren't living; they are \"being lived.\" They \nare reacting, unaware of the unique endowmen ts that lie dormant and undeveloped within. \n   And there is no shortcut in developing",
