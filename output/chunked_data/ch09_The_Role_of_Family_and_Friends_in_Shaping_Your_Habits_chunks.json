Each of these cultures and groups comes with its\nown set of expectations and standards—when and whether\nto get married, how many children to have, which holidays\nto celebrate, how much money to spend on your child’s\nbirthday party . In many ways, these social norms are the\ninvisible rules that guide your behavior each day . You’re\nalways keeping them in mind, even if they are at the not\ntop of your mind. Often, you follow the habits of your\nculture without thinking, without questioning, and\nsometimes without remembering. As the French\nphilosopher Michel de Montaigne wrote, “The customs and\npractices of life in society sweep us along.”\nMost of the time, going along with the group does not\nfeel like a burden. Everyone wants to belong. If you grow\nup in a family that rewards you for your chess skills,\nplaying chess will seem like a very attractive thing to do . If\nyou work in a job where everyone wears expensive suits,\nthen you’ll be inclined to splurge on one as well. If all of\nyour friends are sharing an inside joke or using a new\nphrase, you’ll want to do it, too, so they know that you “get\nit.” Behaviors are attractive when they help us ﬁt in.\nWe imitate the habits of three groups in particular:\n1. The close.\n2. The many .\n3. The powerful.\nEach group oﬀers an opportunity to leverage the 2nd\nLaw of Behavior Change and make our habits more\nattractive.\n1. Imitating the Close\nProximity has a powerful eﬀect on our behavior . This is true\nof the physical environment, as we discussed in Chapter 6,\nbut it is also true of the social environment.\nWe pick up habits from the people around us. W e copy\nthe way our parents handle arguments, the way our peers\nﬂirt with one another , the way our coworkers get results.\nWhen your friends smoke pot, you give it a try , too.

It transforms a personal quest into a shared one.\nPreviously , you were on your own. Y our identity was\nsingular . You are a reader . You are a musician. Y ou are an\nathlete. When you join a book club or a band or a cycling\ngroup, your identity becomes linked to those around you.\nGrowth and change is no longer an individual pursuit. We\nare readers. W e are musicians. W e are cyclists.  The shared\nidentity begins to reinforce your personal identity . This is\nwhy remaining part of a group after achieving a goal is\ncrucial to maintaining your habits. It’s friendship and\ncommunity that embed a new identity and help behaviors\nlast over the long run.\n2. Imitating the Many\nIn the 1950s, psychologist Solomon Asch conducted a\nseries of experiments that are now taught to legions of\nundergrads each year . To begin each experiment, the\nsubject entered the room with a group of strangers.\nUnbeknownst to them, the other participants were actors\nplanted by the researcher and instructed to deliver scripted\nanswers to certain questions.\nThe group would be shown one card with a line on it and\nthen a second card with a series of lines. Each person was\nasked to select the line on the second card that was similar\nin length to the line on the ﬁrst card. It was a very simple\ntask. Here is an example of two cards used in the\nexperiment:\nCONFORMING TO SOCIAL NORMS\nFIGURE 10: This is a r epresentation of two car ds used by\nSolomon Asch in his famous social confor mity e xperiments. The\nlength of the line on the ﬁrst car d (lef t) is obviously the same as\nline C, but when a gr oup of actors claimed it was a diﬀer ent\nlength the r esear ch subjects would of ten change their minds and\ngo with the cr owd rather than believe their own eyes.\nThe experiment always began the same. First, there\nwould be some easy trials where everyone agreed on the\ncorrect line. A fter a few rounds, the participants were\nshown a test that was just as obvious as the previous ones,\nexcept the actors in the room would select an intentionally\nincorrect  answer . For example, they would respond “ A” to\nthe comparison shown in Figure 10. Everyone would agree\nthat the lines were the same even though they were clearly\ndiﬀerent.\nThe subject, who was unaware of the ruse, would\nimmediately become bewildered. Their eyes would open\nwide. They would laugh nervously to themselves. They\nwould double-check the reactions of other participants.\nTheir agitation would grow as one person after another\ndelivered the same incorrect response. Soon, the subject\nbegan to doubt their own eyes. Eventually , they delivered\nthe answer they knew in their heart to be incorrect.\nAsch ran this experiment many times and in many\ndiﬀerent ways. What he discovered was that as the number\nof actors increased, so did the conformity of the subject. If\nit was just the subject and one actor , then there was no\neﬀect on the person’s choice.

We are constantly scanning\nour environment and wondering, “ What is everyone else\ndoing?” W e check reviews on Amazon or Y elp or\nTripAdvisor because we want to imitate the “best” buying,\neating, and travel habits. It’s usually a smart strategy .\nThere is evidence in numbers.\nBut there can be a downside.\nThe normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the\ndesired behavior of the individual. F or example, one study\nfound that when a chimpanzee learns an eﬀective way to\ncrack nuts open as a member of one group and then\nswitches to a new group that uses a less eﬀective strategy ,\nit will avoid using the superior nut cracking method just to\nblend in with the rest of the chimps.\nHumans are similar . There is tremendous internal\npressure to comply with the norms of the group. The\nreward of being accepted is often greater than the reward\nof winning an argument, looking smart, or ﬁnding truth.\nMost days, we’d rather be wrong with the crowd than be\nright by ourselves.\nThe human mind knows how to get along with others. It\nwants  to get along with others. This is our natural mode.\nYou can override it—you can choose to ignore the group or\nto stop caring what other people think—but it takes work.\nRunning against the grain of your culture requires extra\neﬀort.\nWhen changing your habits means challenging the tribe,\nchange is unattractive. When changing your habits means\nﬁtting in with the tribe, change is very attractive.\n3. Imitating the P owerful\nHumans everywhere pursue power , prestige, and status.\nWe want pins and medallions on our jackets. W e want\nPresident or P artner in our titles. W e want to be\nacknowledged, recognized, and praised. This tendency can\nseem vain, but overall, it’s a smart move. Historically , a\nperson with greater power and status has access to more\nresources, worries less about survival, and proves to be a\nmore attractive mate.\nWe are drawn to behaviors that earn us respect,\napproval, admiration, and status. W e want to be the one in\nthe gym who can do muscle-ups or the musician who can\nplay the hardest chord progressions or the parent with the\nmost accomplished children because these things separate\nus from the crowd. Once we ﬁt in, we start looking for ways\nto stand out.\nThis is one reason we care so much about the habits of\nhighly eﬀective people. W e try to copy the behavior of\nsuccessful people because we desire success ourselves.\nMany of our daily habits are imitations of people we\nadmire. Y ou replicate the marketing strategies of the most\nsuccessful ﬁrms in your industry . You make a recipe from\nyour favorite baker . You borrow the storytelling strategies\nof your favorite writer . You mimic the communication style\nof your boss. W e imitate people we envy .\nHigh-status people enjoy the approval, respect, and\npraise of others. And that means if a behavior can get us\napproval, respect, and praise, we ﬁnd it attractive.\nWe are also motivated to avoid behaviors that would\nlower our status. W e trim our hedges and mow our lawn\nbecause we don’t want to be the slob of the neighborhood.\nWhen our mother comes to visit, we clean up the house\nbecause we don’t want to be judged. W e are continually\nwondering “ What will others think of me?” and altering our\nbehavior based on the answer .\nThe P olgar sisters—the chess prodigies mentioned at the\nbeginning of this chapter—are evidence of the powerful\nand lasting impact social inﬂuences can have on our\nbehavior . The sisters practiced chess for many hours each\nday and continued this remarkable eﬀort for decades. But\nthese habits and behaviors maintained their attractiveness,\nin part, because they were valued by their culture. From\nthe praise of their parents to the achievement of diﬀerent\nstatus markers like becoming a grandmaster , they had\nmany reasons to continue their eﬀort.\nChapter Summary\nThe culture we live in determines which behaviors are\nattractive to us.\nWe tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved\nof by our culture because we have a strong desire to ﬁt\nin and belong to the tribe.\nWe tend to imitate the habits of three social groups:\nthe close (family and friends), the many (the tribe), and\nthe powerful (those with status and prestige).\nOne of the most eﬀective things you can do to build\nbetter habits is to join a culture where (1) your desired\nbehavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already\nhave something in common with the",
