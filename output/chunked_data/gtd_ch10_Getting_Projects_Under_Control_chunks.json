Then they can reside there for later use as needed. \nProjects That Need Next Actions About Planning \nThere are probably a few projects you can think of right now, off \nthe top of your head, that you know you want to get  more objecti- \nfied, fleshed out, and under control. Perhaps you h ave an impor- \ntant meeting coming up and you know you have to pre pare an \nagenda and materials for it. Or you've just inherit ed the job of \ncoordinating the annual associates' conference, and  you've got to \nget it organized as soon as possible so you can sta rt delegating sig- \nnificant pieces. Or you've got to clarify a job des cription for a new \nposition on your team to give to Human Resources. I f you haven't \ndone it already, get a next action now that will start the planning \nprocess for each of these, and put it on the approp riate action list. \nThen proceed with further planning steps. \nTypical Planning Steps \nThe most common types of planning-oriented actions will be \nyour own brainstorming and organizing, setting up m eetings, and \ngathering information. \nBrainstorming Some of the projects that have your attention \nright now will require you to do your own free-form  thinking; this \nis especially true of those for which you were not clear about what \n213 \nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY | PART TWO \nthe next action would be when you made that decisio n. These \nshould all have a next action, such as \"Draft ideas  re X.\" \nYou need to decide where and how you want to do tha t \naction, in order to know which action list to put i t on.

Or you're stir- \nring the spaghetti sauce in the kitchen and it occu rs to you that \nyou might want to give out nice tote bags to partic ipants in the \nupcoming conference. Or you're watching the evening  news when \nyou suddenly remember another key person you might want to \ninclude in the advisory council you're putting toge ther. \nIf these aren't specifically next actions that can go directly on \nyour action lists, you'll still need to capture and  organize them \nsomewhere that makes sense. Of course the most crit ical tools for \nensuring that nothing gets lost is your collection system—your \nin-basket, pad, and paper (or equivalents) at work and at home, \nand in a portable version (an index card) while you 're out and \nabout. You need to hold all your ideas until you la ter decide what \nto do with them. \nTools and Structures That Support \nProject Thinking \nNo matter at what level project ideas show up, it's  great to have \ngood tools always close at hand for capturing them as they occur. \nOnce they've been captured, it's useful to have acc ess to them \nwhenever you need to refer to them. \n215 \nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY I  PART TWO \nThinking Tools \nOne of the great secrets to getting ideas and incre asing your pro- \nductivity is utilizing the function-follows-form ph enomenon—\ngreat tools can trigger good thinking. (I've come u p \nwith some of my most productive thoughts when \nplaying with my Palm organizer in an airport, wait-\ning for a flight!) \nIf you aren't writing anything down, it's \nextremely difficult to stay focused on anything for\nmore than a few minutes, especially if you're by yo ur- \nself. But when you utilize physical tools to keep y our \nthinking anchored, you can stay engaged construc- \ntively for hours. \nWriting Instruments \nKeep good writing tools around all the time so you never have any \nunconscious resistance to thinking due to not havin g \nanything to capture it with. If I don't have some- \nthing to write with, I can sense that I'm not as co m- \nfortable letting myself think about projects and \nsituations. \nConversely, I have done some great thinking \nand planning at times just because I wanted to use \nmy nice-looking, smooth-writing ballpoint pen! You \nmay not be inspired by cool gear like I am, but if you \nare, do yourself a favor and invest in quality writ ing \ntools. \nI also suggest that you keep nice ballpoint pens at  the sta- \ntions where you're likely to want to take notes—par ticularly near \nthe phones around your house. \n216 Luck affects \neverything. Let \nyour hook always \nbe cast; in the \nstream where you \nleast expect it there \nwill be a fish. \n—\nFunction often \nfollows form. Give \nyourself a context \nfor capturing \nthoughts, and \nthoughts will occur \nthat you don't yet \nknow you have. \nCHAPTER 10  |  GETTING PROJECTS UNDER CONTROL \nPaper and Pads \nIn addition to writing tools, you should always hav e functional \npads of paper close at hand. Legal pads work well b ecause you can \neasily tear off pages with ideas and notes and toss\nthem into your in-basket until you get a chance to \nprocess them. Also you will often want to keep some\nof your informal mind-maps, and you can put those \nseparate pieces of paper in appropriate file folder s \nwithout having to rewrite them. \nEasels and Whiteboards \nIf you have room for them, whiteboards and/or easel  pads are very \nfunctional thinking tools to use from time to time.  They give you \nplenty of space on which to jot down ideas, and it can be useful to \nkeep them up in front of you for while, as you incu - \nbate on a topic.

Once I've booted up and\nthe screen is ready in front of me, I find that thi nking \njust automatically starts to happen. This is anothe r \ngood reason to ensure that your typing and keyboard\nskills are sufficient to make engaging with the com puter at least \neasy, if not downright fun. \nThe Support Structures \nIn addition to good tools ubiquitously at hand, it is productive to \nhave accessible formats into which project thinking  can be cap- \ntured. Much as a pen and paper in front of you supp orts brain- \nstorming, having good tools and places for organizi ng project \ndetails facilitates the more linear planning that m any projects \nneed. \nCreate File Folders or Loose-Leaf Pages as Needed \nA good general-reference filing system, right at ha nd and easy to \nuse, is not only critical to manage the general wor kflow process, \nbut highly functional for project thinking as well.  Often a project \nbegins to emerge when it's triggered by relevant da ta, notes, and \nmiscellaneous materials, and for this reason, you'l l want to create \na folder for a topic as soon as you have something to put in it. If \nyour filing system is too formal (or nonexistent), you'll probably \nmiss many opportunities to generate a project focus  sufficiently \nearly. As soon as you return from that first meetin g with your ini- \ntial notes about a topic that has just emerged on t he horizon, cre- \nate a file and store them in it right away (after y ou have gleaned \nany next actions, of course). \nMany times, in coaching clients, I find that the me re act of \n218 Leverage your \ncomputer as a think \nstation. \nCHAPTER 10  |  GETTING PROJECTS UNDER CONTROL \ncreating a file for a topic into which we can organ ize random \nnotes and potentially relevant materials gives them  a significantly \nimproved sense of control. It's a way of physically , visibly, and psy- \nchologically getting their \"arms around it.\" \nIf you like to work with a loose-leaf notebook or \nplanner, it's good to keep an inventory of fresh no te \npaper or graph paper that you can use to set up a p age \non a theme or project as it shows up. While some \nprojects may later deserve a whole tabbed section o r \neven an entire notebook of their own, they don't st art \nout that way. And most of your projects may need \nonly a page or two to hold the few ideas you need t o \ntrack. \nSoftware Tools \nSoftware is in one sense a dark black hole to explo re in search of \ngood \"project management\" tools. For the most part,  the applica- \ntions that are specifically designed for project or ganizing are way \ntoo complex, with too much horsepower to really be functional for \n98 percent of what most people need to manage. They 're appro- \npriate only for the very small percentage of the pr ofessional world \nthat actually needs them. The rest of us usually fi nd bits and \npieces of applications more informal and project-fr iendly. As I've \nnoted, I have never seen any two projects that need ed the same \namount of detailing and structure to get them under  control. So it \nwould be difficult to create any one application th at would suffice \nfor the majority. \nDigital Outlining Most of what anyone needs to structure his \nor her thinking about projects can be found in any kind of ap- \nplication that",

Over the years  I've seen \nthese programs more often tried and discontinued th an utilized as \na consistent tool. When they're used successfully, they're usually \nhighly customized to fit very specific requirements  for the com- \npany or the industry. \nI anticipate that less structured and more function al appli- \ncations will emerge in the coming years, based on t he ways we \nnaturally think and plan. Until then, best stick wi th some good \nand simple outliner. \nAttaching Digital Notes \nIf you are using a digital organizer, much of the p roject planning \nyou need to capture outside your head can in fact b e satisfactorily \nmanaged in an attached note field. If you have the project itself as \nan item on a list on a Palm, or as a task in Micros oft Outlook, you \ncan open the accompanying \"Note\" section and jot id eas, bullet \npoints, and subcomponents of the project.

I \nused to use a Symantec program called Grandview, an d now I \noften use Microsoft Word for just this kind of proj ect planning. \nHere's a piece of an outline I created for one of o ur own planning \nsessions: \n219 If you don't have a \ngood system for \nfiling bad ideas, you \nprobably don't have \none for filing good \nones, either.\n220 \nThe great thing about outlining applications is tha t they can \nbe as complex or as simple as required. There are n umerous soft- \nware programs that provide this kind of basic hiera rchical struc- \nturing. The trick is to find one that you feel comf ortable with, so \nyou can rapidly get familiar with how to insert hea dings and sub- \nheadings and move them around as needed.
