You'll be prioritizing more intuitively  as you see the \nwhole list, against quite a number of shifting vari ables. The list is \njust a way for you to keep track of the total inven tory of active \nthings to which you have made a commitment, and to have that \ninventory available for review. \nWhen I refer to a \"list,\" keep in mind that I mean nothing \nmore than a grouping of items with some similar cha racteristic. A \nlist could look like one of three things: (1) a fil e folder with sepa- \nrate paper notes for the items within the category;  (2) an actual \nlist on a titled piece of paper (often within a loo se-leaf organizer \nor planner); or (3) an inventory in a software prog ram or on a \ndigital assistant, such as Microsoft Outlook task c ategories or a \ncategory on a handheld PDA. \n141 / would not give a \nfig for the \nsimplicity on this \nside of complexity, \nbut I would give \nmy life for the \nsimplicity on the \nother side of \ncomplexity. \n—Oliver Wendell \nHolmes \nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  I  PART TWO \nOrganizing Action Reminders \nIf you've emptied your in-basket, you'll undoubtedl y have created \na stack of \"Pending\" reminders for yourself, repres enting longer- \nthan-two-minute actions that cannot be delegated to  someone \nelse. You'll probably have anywhere from twenty to sixty or sev- \nenty or more such items.

You'll also want to decide on the most a ppropriate way \nphysically to organize those groups, whether as ite ms in folders or \non lists, either paper-based or digital. \nThe Actions That Go on Your Calendar \nFor the purposes of organization, as I've said, the re are two basic \nkinds of actions: those that must be done on a cert ain day and/or \nat a particular time, and those that just need to b e done as soon as \nyou can get to them, around your other calendared i tems. Calen- \ndared action items can be either time-specific (e.g ., \"4:00—5:00 \nmeet with Jim\") or day-specific (\"Call Rachel Tuesd ay to see if she \ngot the proposal\"). \nAs you were processing your in-basket, you probably  came \nacross things that you put right into your calendar  as they showed \nup. You may have realized that the next action on \ngetting a medical checkup, for example, was to call\nand make the appointment, and so (since the action \nrequired two minutes or less) you actually did it w hen \nit occurred to you. Writing the appointment into \nyour calendar as you made it would then have been \ncommon sense. \nWhat many people want to do, however, based \n142 The calendar should \nshow only the \"hard \nlandscape\" around \nwhich you do the \nrest of your actions. \nCHAPTER 7  |  ORGANIZING: SETTING UP THE RIGHT BUCKETS \non old habits of writing daily to-do lists, is put actions on the calen- \ndar that they think they'd really like to get done next Monday, say, \nbut that then actually might not, and that might th en have to be \ntaken over to following days. Resist this impulse. You need to trust \nyour calendar as sacred territory, reflecting the e xact hard edges of \nyour day's commitments, which should be noticeable at a glance \nwhile you're on the run. That'll be much easier if the only things in \nthere are those that you absolutely have to get done on that day. \nWhen the calendar is relegated to its proper role i n organizing, the \nmajority of the actions that you need to do are lef t in the category of \n\"as soon as possible, against all the other things I have to do.\" \nOrganizing As-Soon-As-Possible Actions by Context \nOver many years I have discovered that the best way  to be \nreminded of an \"as soon as I can\" action is by the particular context \nrequired for that action—that is,",

    "text": " As-Soon-As-Possible Actions by Context \nOver many years I have discovered that the best way  to be \nreminded of an \"as soon as I can\" action is by the particular context \nrequired for that action—that is, either the tool o r the location or \nthe person needed to complete it. For instance, if the action requires \na computer, it should go on an \"At Computer\" list. If your action \ndemands that you be out in your car driving around (such as stop- \nping by the bank or going to the hardware store), t he \"Errands\" list \nwould be the appropriate place to track it. If the next step is to talk \nabout something face-to-face with your partner Emil y, putting it \ninto an \"Emily\" folder or list makes the most sense . \nHow discrete these categories will need to be will depend on \n(1) how many actions you actually have to track; an d (2) how \noften you change the contexts within which to do th em. \nIf you are that rare person who has only twenty-fiv e next \nactions, a single \"Next Actions\" list might suffice . It could include \nitems as diverse as \"Buy nails\" and \"Talk to boss a bout staff \nchanges\" and \"Draft ideas about off-site meeting.\" If, however, \nyou have fifty or a hundred next actions pending, k eeping all of \nthose on one big list would make it too difficult t o see what you \nneeded to see; each time you got any window of time  to do some- \nthing, you'd have to do unproductive resorting. If you happened to \nbe on a short break at a conference, during which y ou might be \n143 \n144 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY I  PART TWO \nable to make some calls, you'd have to identify the  items that were \ncalls among a big batch of unrelated items. When yo u went out to \ndo odds and ends, you'd probably want to pick out y our errands \nand make another list. \nAnother productivity factor that this kind of organ ization \nsupports is leveraging your energy when you're in a  certain mode. \nWhen you're in \"phone mode,\" it helps to make a lot  of phone \ncalls—just crank down your \"Calls\" list. When your computer is up \nand running and you're cruising along digitally, it 's useful to get as \nmuch done on-line as you can without having to shif t into another \nkind of activity. It takes more energy than most pe ople realize to \nunhook out of one set of behaviors and get into ano ther kind of \nrhythm and tool set. And obviously, when a key pers on is sitting in \nfront of you in your office, you'd be wise to have all the things you \nneed to talk about with him or her immediately at h and. \nThe Most Common Categories of Action Reminders \nYou'll probably find that at least a few of the fol lowing common \nlist headings for next actions will make sense for you: \n• \"Calls\" \n• \"At Computer\" \n•\"Errand's\" \n• \"Office Actions\" or \"At Office\" (miscellaneous) \n• \"At Home\" \n• \"Agendas\" (for people and meetings) \n• \"Read/Review\" \n\"Calls\" This is the list of all the phone calls you need to  make; \nyou can work off it as long as you have a phone ava ilable. The \nmore mobile you are (especially if you have a cell phone), the \nmore useful you'll find it to have one single list of all your calls: \nthose strange little windows of time that you wind up with when \nyou're off-site or traveling—on a break or waiting for a plane, \nmaybe—offer a perfect opportunity to work down your  list. Hav- \nCHAPTER 7  |  ORGANIZING: SETTING UP THE RIGHT BUCKETS \ning a discrete \"Calls\" list makes it much easier to  focus and intu- \nitively pick the best call to make in the moment. \nI -suggest that you take the time to write the phon e number \nitself alongside each item. There are many situatio ns in which you \nwould probably make the call if the number was alre ady there in \nfront of you but not if you had to look it up. \n\"At Computer\" If you work with a computer—particularly if you \nmove around with a laptop or have a PC at work and another one \nat home—it can be helpful to group all those action s that you \nneed to do when it's on and running.

For instance, if you have a contractor doi ng a significant \npiece of work on your house or property, you can cr eate a list for \nhim for the duration of the project. As you're walk ing around the \nsite after he's left for the day, you may notice se veral things you \nneed to talk with him about, and you'll want that l ist to be easy to \ncapture and to access as needed. \nGiven the usefulness of this type of list, your sys tem should \nallow you to add \"Agendas\" ad hoc, as needed, quick ly and simply. \nFor example, inserting a page for a person or a mee ting within an \n\"Agenda\" section in a loose-leaf notebook planner t akes only seconds, \nas does adding a dedicated \"Memo\" in a PDA's \"Agend a\" category. \n\"Read/Review\" You will no doubt have discovered in your in- \nbasket a number of things for which your next actio n is to read. I\nhope you will have held to the two-minute rule and dispatched a \nnumber of those quick-skim items already—tossing, f iling, or \nrouting them forward as appropriate. \nTo-read items that you know will demand more than t wo \nminutes of your time are usually best managed in a separate physi- \ncal stack-basket labeled \"Read/Review.\" This is sti ll a \"list\" by my \ndefinition, but one that's more efficiently dealt w ith by group- \ning the documents and magazines themselves in a tra y and/or \nportable folder. \nFor many people, the \"Read/Review\" stack can get qu ite \nlarge. That's why it's critical that the pile be re served only for \nthose longer-than-two-minute things that you actual ly want to \nread when you have time. That can be daunting enough in itself, \nbut things get seriously out of control and psychologically numb- \ning when the edges of this category are not clearly  defined. A \npristine delineation will at least make you conscio us of the inven- \ntory",

When the next action on something is up to some one else, \nyou don't need an action reminder, just a trigger about what \nyou're waiting for from whom. Your role is to revie w that list as \noften as you need to and assess whether you ought t o be taking \nan action such as checking the status or lighting a  fire under the \nproject. \nYou'll probably find it works best to keep this \"Wa iting For\" \nlist close at hand, in the same system as your own \"Next Actions\" \nreminder lists. The responsibility for the next ste p may bounce \nback and forth many times before a project is finis hed. For exam- \nple, you may need to make a call to a vendor to req uest a proposal \nfor a piece of work (on your \"Calls\" list.) Having made the call, \nyou then wait for the vendor to get back to you wit h the proposal \n(the proposal goes to your \"Waiting For\" list).

And \nso on.* \nYou'll get a great feeling when you know that your \"Waiting \nFor\" list is the complete inventory of everything y ou care about \nthat other people are supposed to be doing. \nUsing the Original Item as Its Own Action Reminder \nThe most efficient way to track your action reminde rs is to add \nthem to lists or folders as they occur to you. The originating trig- \nger won't be needed after you have processed it. Yo u \nmight take notes in the meeting with your boss, but\nyou can toss those after you've pulled out any proj ects \nand actions associated with them. While some peo- \nple try to archive voice-mails that they still need\nto \"do something about,\" that's not the most effec-\ntive way to manage the reminders embedded in them. \nThere are some exceptions to this rule, however. Ce rtain \nkinds of input will most efficiently serve as their  own reminders of \nrequired actions, rather than your having to write something \nabout them on a list. This is particularly true for  some paper- \nbased materials and some e-mails. \nManaging Paper-Based Workflow \nSome things are their own best reminders of work to  be done. The \ncategory of \"Read/Review\" articles, publications, a nd documents \nis the most common example. It would obviously be o verkill to \nwrite \"Review Fortune magazine\" on some action list when you \ncould just as easily toss the magazine itself into your \"Read/ \nReview\" basket to act as the trigger. \n150 *Digital list managers (like the Palm's) or low-tec h papers in separate folders \n",

When the next action on something is up to some one else, \nyou don't need an action reminder, just a trigger about what \nyou're waiting for from whom.

Relative to yo ur personal \norganization and productivity, this is not a core i ssue, \nso long as all of your projects and actions are in a \ncontrol system that you work with regularly.

If  you \nacknowledge the power of the imagination to foster changes in \nperception and performance, it's easy to see how ha ving a \n\"Someday/Maybe\" list out in front of your conscious  mind could \npotentially add many wonderful adventures to your l ife and work. \nWe're likely to seize opportunities when they arise  if we've already \nidentified and captured them as a possibility. That  has certainly \nbeen my own experience: learning to play the flute and how to sail \nbig boats both started in this category for me. In addition to \nyour in-basket, there are two rich sources to tap f or your \"Some- \nday/Maybe\" list: your creative imagination and your  list of current \nprojects. \nMake an Inventory of Your Creative Imaginings What are the \nthings you really might want to do someday if you h ave the time, \nmoney, and inclination? Write them on your have \"So meday/ \nMaybe\" list. Typical categories include: \n• Things to get or build for your home \n• Hobbies to take up \nCHAPTER 7  I  ORGANIZING: SETTING UP THE RIGHT BUCKETS \n• Skills to learn \n• Creative expressions to explore \n• Clothes and accessories to buy \n• Toys (gear!) to acquire \n• Trips to take \n• Organizations to join \n• Service projects to contribute to \n• Things to see and do \nReassess Your Current Projects    Now's a good time to review your \n\"Projects\" list from a more elevated perspective (t hat is, the stand- \npoint of your job and goals) and consider whether \nyou might transfer some of your current commit- \nments to \"Someday/Maybe.\" If on reflection you \nrealize that an optional project doesn't have a cha nce \nof getting your attention for the next months or \nmore, move it to this list. \nSpecial Categories of \"Someday/Maybe\" \nMore than likely you have some special interests th at involve lots \nof possible things to do. It can be fun to collect these on lists. For \ninstance: \n• Food—recipes, menus, restaurants, wines \n• Children—things to do with them \n• Books to read \n• CDs to buy \n• Videos to buy/rent \n• Cultural events to attend \n• Gift ideas \n• Garden ideas \n• Web sites to surf \n• Weekend trips to take \n• Meeting ideas \n• Party ideas \n169 What lies in our \npower to do, lies in \nour power not \nto do. \n—\n170 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  |  PART TWO \n• Ideas—Misc. (meaning you don't know where else to  put \nthem!) \nThese kinds of lists can be a cross between referen ce and \n\"Someday/Maybe\"—reference because you can just coll ect and \nadd to lists of good wines or restaurants or books,  to consult as \nyou like; \"Someday/Maybe\" because you might want to  review the \nlisted items on a regular basis to remind yourself to try one or \nmore of them at some point. \nIn any case, this is another great reason to have a n organizing \nsystem that makes it easy to capture things that ma y add value \nand variety and interest to your life—without clogg ing your mind \nand work space with undecided, unfinished business.\nThe Danger of \"Hold and Review\" Files and Piles \nMany people have created some sort of \"Hold and Rev iew\" pile or \nfile (or whole drawer) that vaguely fits within the  category of \n\"Someday/Maybe.\" They tell themselves, \"When I have  time, I \nmay like to get to this,\" and a \"Hold and Review\" f ile seems a con- \nvenient place to put it. I personally don't recomme nd this particu- \nlar kind of subsystem, because in virtually every c ase I have come \nacross, the client \"held\" but didn't \"review,\" and there was numb- \nness and resistance about the stack. The value of \" someday/ \nmaybe\" disappears if you don't put your conscious a wareness back \non it with some consistency. \nAlso, there's a big difference between something th at's man- \naged well, as a \"Someday/Maybe\" list, and something  that's just a \ncatchall bucket for \"stuff.\"",

Most of the \npeople I've coached were not nearly as comfortable with their cal- \nendars as they could have been; otherwise they prob ably would \nhave found many more things to put in there. \nOne of the three uses of a calendar is for day-specific informa- \ntion. This category can include a number of things, but o ne of the \nmost creative ways to utilize this function is to e nter things that \nyou want to take off your mind and reassess at some  later date. \nHere are a few of the myriad things you should cons ider inserting: \n• Triggers for activating projects \n• Events you might want to participate in \n• Decision catalysts \nTriggers for Activating Projects If you have a project that you \ndon't really need to think about now but that deser ves a flag at \nsome point in the future, you can pick an appropria te date and put \na reminder about the project in your calendar for t hat day. It \nshould go in some day-specific (versus time-specifi c) calendar slot \nfor the things you want to be reminded of on that d ay; then when \nthe day arrives, you see the reminder and insert th e item as an \nactive project on your \"Projects\" list. Typical can didates for this \ntreatment are: \n• Special events with a certain lead time for handlin g (product \nlaunches, fund-raising drives, etc.) \n• Regular events that you need to prepare for, such a s budget \nreviews, annual conferences, planning events, or me etings (e.g., \nwhen should you add next year's \"annual sales confe rence\" to \nyour \"Projects\" list?) \n• Key dates for significant people that you might wan t to do some- \nthing about (birthdays, anniversaries, holiday gift -giving, etc.) \n171 \nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY I  PART TWO \nEvents You Might Want to Participate In You probably get notices \nconstantly about seminars, conferences, speeches, a nd social and \ncultural events that you may want to decide about a ttending as the \ntime gets closer. So figure out when that \"closer\" time is and put a \ntrigger in your calendar on the appropriate date—fo r example: \n\"Chamber of Commerce breakfast tomorrow?\" \n\"Tigers season tickets go on sale today\" \n\"PBS special on Australia tonight 8:00 P.M.\" \n\"Church BBQ next Saturday\" \nIf you can think of any jogs like these that you'd like to put \ninto your system, do it right now. \nDecision Catalysts    Once in a while there may be a significant \ndecision that you need to make but can't (or don't want to) make \nright away. That's fine, as long as you've conclude d that the addi- \ntional information you need has to come from an internal rather \nthan an external source (e.g., you need to sleep on it). \n(Obviously, external data you need in order to make  a \ndecision should go on your \"Next Actions\" or \"Wait-\ning For\" lists.) But in order to move to a level of  OK- \nness about not deciding, you'd better put out a safety \nnet that you can trust to get you to focus on the i ssue \nappropriately in the future. A calendar reminder ca n \nserve that purpose.* \nSome typical decision areas in this category includ e: \n• Hire/fire \n• Merge/acquire/sell/divest \n• Change job/career \n172 *If you're using a group-accessible calendar, you m ust maintain discretion about \nthese kinds of triggers. Digital calendars usually have \"private\" categorization \nfunctions you can use for entries",

It can be an extremely functional tool, all owing you to in \neffect set up your own post office and \"mail\" thing s to yourself for \nreceipt on a designated future date. I myself have used a tickler file \nfor years and can't imagine being without it. \nEssentially the tickler is a simple file-folder sys tem that \nallows you to distribute paper and other physical r eminders in \nsuch a way that whatever you want to see on a parti cular date in \nthe future \"automatically\" shows up that day in you r in-basket. \nIf you have a secretary or assistant, you can entru st at least a \npart of this task to him or her, assuming that he/s he has some \nworking version of this or a similar system. Typica l examples \nwould be: \n• \"Hand me this agenda the morning of the day I have the \nmeeting.\" \n• \"Give this back to me on Monday to rethink, since i t applies to \na meeting on Wednesday.\" \n• \"Remind me about the Hong Kong trip two weeks ahead , and \nwe'll plan the logistics.\" \nThen every day of the week, that day's folder is pu lled and \nreviewed. \n*Also referred to as a \"suspense,\" \"bring forward,\"  or \"follow-up\" file. \n173 \n174 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY I  PART TWO \nWhile you can (and probably should) utilize staff t o handle \nas much of this as is appropriate, I recommend that , if you can \nintegrate it into your life-style, you maintain you r own tickler file. \nThere are many useful functions it can perform, at least some of \nwhich you may want to avail yourself of outside the  pale of your \nassistant's responsibilities. I use my tickler file  to manage my \ntravel tickets and confirmations; paper-based trave l directions, \nagendas, and maps; reminders of event notifications  that come in \nthe mail; information about \"might-want-to-buy\" kin ds of things \nI want to reconsider in the future; and so forth. \nBottom line: the tickler file demands only a one-se cond-per- \nday new behavior to make it work, and it has a payo ff value \nlogarithmically greater than the personal investmen t. \nSetting Up a Tickler File You need forty-three folders—thirty- \none daily files labeled \"1\" through \"31,\" and twelv e more labeled \nwith the names of the months of the year. The daily  files are kept \nin front, beginning with the file for tomorrow's da te (if today is \nOctober 5, then the first file would be \"6\"). The s ucceeding daily \nfiles represent the days of the rest of the month ( \"6\" through \n\"31\"). Behind the \"31\" file is the monthly file for  the next month \n(\"November\"), and behind that are the daily files \" 1\" though \"5.\" \nFollowing that are the rest of the monthly files (\" December\" \nthrough \"October\"). The next daily file is emptied into your in- \nbasket every day, and then the folder is refiled at  the back of the \ndailies (at which point, instead of October 6, it r epresents Novem- \nber 6). In the same way, when the next monthly file rea ches the \nfront (on October 31 after you empty the daily file , the \"Novem- \nber\" file will be the next one, with the daily file s",

In such cases, inherent projects and actions still \nneed to be clarified and organized into a personal system. \nBut there are some things that don't quite fit into that \ncategory. \nCHAPTER 7  I  ORGANIZING: SETTING UP THE RIGHT BUCKETS \nBlueprinting Key Areas of Work and Responsibility \nObjectives like \"Maintain good physical conditionin g\" or \"Physi- \ncal health and vitality\" may still need to be built  into some sort of \noverview checklist that will be reviewed regularly.  You have multi- \nple layers of outcomes and standards playing on you r psyche and \nyour choices at any point in time, and knowing what  those are, at \nall the different levels, is always a good idea. \nI suggested earlier that there are at least six lev els of your \n\"work\" that could be defined, and that each level d eserves its own \nacknowledgment and evaluation. A complete inventory  of every- \nthing you hold important and are committed to on ea ch of those \nlevels would represent an awesome checklist. It mig ht include: \n• Career goals \n• Service \n• Family \n• Relationships \n• Community \n• Health and energy \n• Financial resources \n• Creative expression \nAnd then moving down a level, within your job, you \nmight want some reminders of your key areas of resp onsibility, \nyour staff, your values, and so on.

Be ready to create and eliminate them as re quired. \nAppropriately used, they can be a tremendous asset in personal \nproductivity. \nIf in fact you have now collected everything that represents an open \nloop in your life and work, processed each one of those items in \n179 \nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  |  PART TWO \nterms of what it means to you and what actions are required, and \norganized the results into a complete system that holds a cur rent \nand complete overview—large and small—of all your p resent \nand \n\"someday\" projects, then you're ready for the next phase of imple- \nmentation in the art of stress-free productivity—th e review \nprocess. \\\n180",
