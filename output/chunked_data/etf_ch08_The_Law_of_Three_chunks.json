Focusing on my key tasks has transformed my life.”\nPerhaps the most important word in the world of work is\n“contribution.” Your rewards, both financial and emotional, willalways be in direct proportion to your results, to the value of your\ncontribution. If you want to increase your rewards, you must focus\non increasing the value of what you do. You must dedicate yourselfto contributing more results to your company. And there are always\nthree key tasks that contribute the most.\nThe Quick List Method\nHere is an exercise that we give to our coaching clients very early in\nthe process. We give them a sheet of paper and then ask them, “In 30\nseconds, write down your three most important goals in life, right\nnow.”\nWhat we have found is that when you only have 30 seconds to write\nyour three most important goals, your answers will be as accurate as\nif you had 30 minutes or three hours. Your subconscious mind seems\nto go into a form of “hyper-drive” and your three most important\ngoals will pop out of your head and onto the paper, often to the\nsurprise of the person doing the exercise.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 59In 80% or more of cases, the three common goals that most people\nhave are first, a financial and career goal; second, a family or personal\nrelationship goal; and third, a health or a fitness goal.\nAnd this is as it should be. These are the three most important areas\nof life. If you give yourself a grade on a scale of one to ten, with one\nbeing the lowest and ten being the highest, and apply this scale to\neach of these three areas, you can immediately identify where youare doing well in life and where you need some improvement. Try ityourself and see. Give this test to your spouse or your children. The\nanswers can be quite revealing.\nLater in our coaching program, we expand this exercise by asking the\nfollowing questions:\n1. What are your three most important business or career  goals,\nright now?\n2. What are your three most important family or relationship\ngoals, right now?\n3. What are your three most important financial goals, right now?\n4. What are your three most important health goals, right now?\n5. What are your three most important personal and professionaldevelopment goals, right now?\n6. What are your three most important social and community\ngoals, right now?\n7.

Every minute that you spend in idle chit\nchat with coworkers is time taken away from the work that you must\naccomplish if you want to keep your job.\nEven worse, time that you waste at work often has to be taken away\nfrom the members of your family. You either have to stay late or take\nwork home and work in the evenings. By not working effectively andefficiently during your workday, you create unnecessary stress and\nyou deprive the members of your family of the very best person you\ncan possibly be.\n There is a story of a little girl who goes to her mother and asks,\n“Mommy, why does daddy bring a briefcase full of work home each\nnight and never spends any time with the family?”\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 62The mother replies sympathetically, “Well honey, you have to\nunderstand, daddy can’t get his work done at the office so he has to\nbring it home and get caught up here.”\nThe little girl then asks, “If that’s the case, why don’t they put him in\na slower class?”\nBalance Is Not an Option\nOne of the most famous sayings of the ancient Greeks was\n“Moderation in all things.”\nYou need balance between your work and your personal life. You\nneed to set priorities at work and concentrate on your most valuable\ntasks. At the same time, you must never lose sight of the fact that the\nreason for working efficiently is so that you can enjoy a higherquality of life at home with your family.\nSometimes people come up to me and ask, “How do I achieve\nbalance between my work and my home life?”\nI ask them in return, “How often does a tight rope walker balance\nwhen he is on the high wire?”\nAfter a few seconds of thinking, they almost always say, “All the\ntime.”\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 63I say, “That is the same situation with balance between family and\nhome life. You have to do it all the time. You never reach a point\nwhere you have attained it perfectly. You have to work at it.”\nYour goal should be to perform at your very best at work, to get the\nvery most done and enjoy the very highest level of rewards possible\nfor you in your career. Simultaneously, you must always remember\nto “smell the flowers along the way.” Never lose sight of the realreasons why you work as hard as you do, and why you are sodetermined to accomplish the very most with the time that you\ninvest. The more time you spend face-to-face with the people you\nlove, the happier you will be.\nEat That Frog!\n1.  Determine the three most important things that you do in your\nwork. Ask, “If I could only do one thing all day long, which one task\ncontributes the greatest value to my career?” Do this exercise two\nmore times. Once you have identified your “Big Three” concentrate\non them single mindedly all day long.\n2.  Identify your three most important goals in life, in each area.\nOrganize them by priority. Make plans for their accomplishment, and\nwork on your plans every single day. You will be amazed at what\nyou achieve in the months and years ahead.",

Every minute that you spend in idle chit\nchat with coworkers is time taken away from the work that you must\naccomplish if you want to keep your job.\nEven worse, time that you waste at work often has to be taken away\nfrom the members of your family. You either have to stay late or take\nwork home and work in the evenings. By not working effectively andefficiently during your workday, you create unnecessary stress and\nyou deprive the members of your family of the very best person you\ncan possibly be.\n There is a story of a little girl who goes to her mother and asks,\n“Mommy, why does daddy bring a briefcase full of work home each\nnight and never spends any time with the family?”\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 62The mother replies sympathetically, “Well honey, you have to\nunderstand, daddy can’t get his work done at the office so he has to\nbring it home and get caught up here.”\nThe little girl then asks, “If that’s the case, why don’t they put him in\na slower class?”\nBalance Is Not an Option\nOne of the most famous sayings of the ancient Greeks was\n“Moderation in all things.”\nYou need balance between your work and your personal life. You\nneed to set priorities at work and concentrate on your most valuable\ntasks. At the same time, you must never lose sight of the fact that the\nreason for working efficiently is so that you can enjoy a higherquality of life at home with your family.\nSometimes people come up to me and ask, “How do I achieve\nbalance between my work and my home life?”\nI ask them in return, “How often does a tight rope walker balance\nwhen he is on the high wire?”\nAfter a few seconds of thinking, they almost always say, “All the\ntime.”\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 63I say, “That is the same situation with balance between family and\nhome life. You have to do it all the time. You never reach a point\nwhere you have attained it perfectly. You have to work at it.”\nYour goal should be to perform at your very best at work, to get the\nvery most done and enjoy the very highest level of rewards possible\nfor you in your career. Simultaneously, you must always remember\nto “smell the flowers along the way",
