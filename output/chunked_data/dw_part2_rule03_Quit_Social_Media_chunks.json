    "text": "Rule #3\nQuit Social Media\nIn 2013, author and digital media \nconsultant Baratunde Thurston launched \nan experiment. He decided to disconnect \nfrom his online life for twenty-five days: \nno Facebook, no Twitter, no Foursquare \n(a service that awarded him “Mayor of \nthe Year” in 2011), not even e-mail. He \nneeded the break. Thurston, who is\n\ndescribed by friends as “the most \nconnected man in the world,” had by his \nown count participated in more than \nfifty-nine thousand Gmail conversations \nand posted fifteen hundred times on his \nFacebook wall in the year leading up to \nhis experiment. “I was burnt out. Fried. \nDone. Toast,” he explained.\nWe know about Thurston’s \nexperiment because he wrote about it in \na cover article for Fast Company  \nmagazine, ironically titled “#UnPlug.” \nAs Thurston reveals in the article, it \ndidn’t take long to adjust to a \ndisconnected life. “By the end of that \nfirst week, the quiet rhythm of my days \nseemed far less strange,” he said. “I was\n\nless stressed about not knowing new \nthings; I felt that I still existed despite \nnot having shared documentary evidence \nof said existence on the Internet.” \nThurston struck up conversations with \nstrangers. He enjoyed food without \nInstagramming the experience. He bought \na bike (“turns out it’s easier to ride the \nthing when you’re not trying to \nsimultaneously check your Twitter”). \n“The end came too soon,” Thurston \nlamented. But he had start-ups to run and \nbooks to market, so after the twenty-five \ndays passed, he reluctantly reactivated \nhis online presence.\nBaratunde Thurston’s experiment \nneatly summarizes two important points\n\nabout our culture’s current relationship \nwith social networks like Facebook, \nTwitter, and Instagram, and infotainment \nsites like Business Insider and BuzzFeed \n—two categories of online distraction \nthat I will collectively call “network \ntools” in the pages ahead. The first point \nis that we increasingly recognize that \nthese tools fragment our time and reduce \nour ability to concentrate. This reality no \nlonger generates much debate; we all \nfeel it. This is a real problem for many \ndifferent people, but the problem is \nespecially dire if you’re attempting to \nimprove your ability to work deeply. In \nthe preceding rule, for example, I \ndescribed several strategies to help you\n\nsharpen your focus. These efforts will \nbecome significantly more difficult if \nyou simultaneously behave like a pre­\nexperiment Baratunde Thurston, \nallowing your life outside such training \nto remain a distracted blur of apps and \nbrowser tabs. Willpower is limited, and \ntherefore the more enticing tools you \nhave pulling at your attention, the harder \nit’ll be to maintain focus on something \nimportant. To master the art of deep \nwork, therefore, you must take back \ncontrol of your time and attention from \nthe many diversions that attempt to steal \nthem\nBefore we begin fighting back \nagainst these distractions, however, we\n\nmust better understand the battlefield. \nThis brings me to the second important \npoint summarized by Baratunde \nThurston’s story: the impotence with \nwhich knowledge workers currently \ndiscuss this problem of network tools \nand attention. Overwhelmed by these \ntools’  demands on his time, Thurston felt \nthat his only option was to (temporarily) \nquit the Internet altogether. This idea that \na drastic Internet sabbatical - is the only \nalternative to the distraction generated \nby social media and infotainment has \nincreasingly pervaded our cultural \nconversation.\nThe problem with this binary \nresponse to this issue is that these two\n\nchoices are much too crude to be useful. \nThe notion that you would quit the \nInternet is, of course, an overstuffed \nstraw man, infeasible for most (unless \nyou’re a journalist writing a piece about \ndistraction). No one is meant to actually \nfollow Baratunde Thurston’s lead—and \nthis reality provides justification for \nremaining with the only offered \nalternative: accepting our current\ndistracted state as inevitable. For all the \ninsight and clarity that Thurston gained \nduring his Internet sabbatical, for \nexample, it didn’t take him long once the \nexperiment ended to slide back into the \nfragmented state where he began.

Facebook, at \nbest, added one more (arguably quite \nmediocre) entertainment option to many \nthat already existed.\nAnother commenter cited making \nfriends in a writing forum. I don’t doubt \nthe existence of these friends, but we can \nassume that these friendships are \nlightweight—given that they’re based on \nsending short messages back and forth \nover a computer network.

But as Pritchard explained to me \n(after preemptively apologizing for a \nmoment of snark), if a farmer actually \nadopted such a simplistic mind-set, “I’d\n\nbe counting the days until the ‘For Sale’  \nsign goes up on the property.” Pritchard, \nlike most practitioners of his trade, \ninstead deploys a more sophisticated \nthought process when assessing tools. \nAnd after applying this process to the \nhay baler, Pritchard was quick to sell it: \nSmith Meadows now purchases all the \nhay it uses.\nHere  S  why...\n“Let’s start by exploring the costs of \nmaking hay,” Pritchard said. “First, \nthere’s the actual cost of fuel, and \nrepairs, and the shed to keep the baler. \nYou also have to pay taxes on it.” These \ndirectly measurable costs, however, \nwere the easy part of his decision. It was\n\ninstead the “opportunity costs” that \nrequired more attention. As he \nelaborated: “If I make hay all summer, I \ncan’t be doing something else.

This guidance is \nimportant because the craftsman \napproach is not cut-and-dry. Identifying\n\nwhat matters most in your life, and then \nattempting to assess the impacts of \nvarious tools on these factors, doesn’t \nreduce to a simple formula—this task \nrequires practice and experimentation. \nThe strategies that follow provide some \nstructure for this practice and \nexperimentation by forcing you to \nreconsider your network tools from \nmany different angles.

In the professional sphere, \nthe details of these goals depend on what \nyou do for a living. In my own work as a \nprofessor, for example, I pursue two \nimportant goals, one centered on being \nan effective teacher in the classroom and \neffective mentor to my graduate students,\n\nand another centered on being an \neffective researcher. While your goals \nwill likely differ, the key is to keep the \nlist limited to what’s most important and \nto keep the descriptions suitably high- \nlevel. (If your goal includes a specific \ntarget—“to reach a million dollars in \nsales” or “to publish a half dozen papers \nin a single year”—then it’s too specific \nfor our purposes here.) When you’re \ndone you should have a small number of \ngoals for both the personal and \nprofessional areas of your life.\nOnce you’ve identified these goals, \nlist for each the two or three most \nimportant activities that help you satisfy \nthe goal. These activities should be\n\nspecific enough to allow you to clearly \npicture doing them.

Our strategy requires him to \ninvestigate Twitter’s impact on the key \nactivities he listed that support his goal. \nThere’s no convincing way to argue that \nTwitter would make Lewis substantially \nbetter at either of these activities. Deep\n\nresearch for Lewis, I assume, requires \nhim to spend weeks and months getting \nto know a small number of sources (he’s \na master of the long-form journalism \nskill of drawing out a source’s story \nover many sessions), and careful \nwriting, of course, requires freedom \nfrom distraction. In both cases, Twitter \nat best has no real impact, and at worst \ncould be substantially negative, \ndepending on Lewis’s susceptibility to \nthe service’s addictive attributes. The \nconclusion would therefore be that \nLewis shouldn’t use Twitter.\nYou might argue at this point that \nconfining our example to this single goal \nis artificial, as it ignores the areas where\n\na service like Twitter has its best chance \nof contributing. For writers, in \nparticular, Twitter is often presented as a \ntool to establish connections with your \naudience that ultimately lead to more \nsales. For a writer like Michael Lewis, \nhowever, marketing doesn’t likely merit \nits own goal when he assesses what’s \nimportant in his professional life. This \nfollows because his reputation \nguarantees that he will receive massive \ncoverage in massively influential media \nchannels, if the book is really good. His \nfocus, therefore, is much more \nproductively applied to the goal of \nwriting the best possible book than \ninstead trying to squeeze out a few extra\n\nsales through inefficient author-driven \nmeans. In other words, the question is \nnot whether Twitter has some \nconceivable benefit to Lewis; it’s \ninstead whether Twitter use significantly \nand positively affects the most important \nactivities in his professional life.\nWhat about a less famous writer?

In \nthis case, book marketing might play a \nmore primary role in his or her goals. \nBut when forced to identify the two or \nthree most important activities \nsupporting this goal, it’s unlikely that the \ntype o f lightweight one-on-one contact \nenabled by Twitter would make the list. \nThis is the result o f simple math. \nImagine that our hypothetical author\n\ndiligently sends ten individualized \ntweets a day, five days a week—each of \nwhich connects one-on-one with a new \npotential reader. Now imagine that 50 \npercent of the people contacted in this \nmanner become loyal fans who will \ndefinitely buy the author’s next book. \nOver the two-year period it might take to \nwrite this book, this yields two thousand \nsales—a modest boost at best in a \nmarketplace where bestseller status \nrequires two or three times more sales \nper week.  The question once again is not \nwhether Twitter offers some  benefits, but \ninstead whether it offers enough  benefits \nto offset its drag on your time and \nattention (two resources that are\n\nespecially valuable to a writer).\nHaving seen an example of this \napproach applied to a professional \ncontext, let’s next consider the \npotentially more disruptive setting of \npersonal goals. In particular, let’s apply \nthis approach to one of our culture’s \nmost ubiquitous and fiercely defended \ntools: Facebook.\nWhen justifying the use of Facebook \n(or similar social networks), most \npeople cite its importance to their social \nlives. With this in mind, let’s apply our \nstrategy to understand whether Facebook \nmakes the cut due to its positive impact \non this aspect of our personal goals. To \ndo so, we’ll once again work with a\n\nhypothetical goal and key supporting \nactivities.\nPersonal Goal:  To maintain close and \nrewarding friendships with a group of \npeople who are important to me.\nKey Activities Supporting This Goal:\n1. Regularly take the time for \nmeaningful connection with those \nwho are most important to me \n(e.g., a long talk, a meal, joint \nactivity).\n2. Give of myself to those who are \nmost important to me (e.g., \nmaking nontrivial sacrifices that\n\nimprove their lives).\nNot everyone will share this exact \ngoal or supporting activities, but \nhopefully you’ll stipulate that they apply \nto many people. Let’s now step back and \napply our strategy’s filtering logic to the \nexample of Facebook in the context of \nthis personal goal. This service, of \ncourse, offers any number of benefits to \nyour social life. To name a few that are \noften mentioned: It allows you to catch \nup with people you haven’t seen in a \nwhile, it allows you to maintain \nlightweight contact with people you \nknow but don’t run into regularly, it \nallows you to more easily monitor\n\nimportant events in people’s lives (such \nas whether or not they’re married or \nwhat their new baby looks like), and it \nallows you to stumble onto online \ncommunities or groups that match your \ninterests.\nThese are real benefits that Facebook \nundeniably offers, but none of these \nbenefits provide a significant positive \nimpact to the two key activities we \nlisted, both of which are offline and \neffort intensive. Our strategy, therefore, \nwould return a perhaps surprising but \nclear conclusion: O f course Facebook  \noffers benefits to your social life, but  \nnone are important enough to what  \nreally matters to you in this area to\n\njustify giving it access to your time and\njjj\nattention. -\nTo be clear, I’m not arguing that \neveryone should stop using Facebook. \nI’m instead showing that for this specific \n(representative) case study, the strategy \nproposed here would suggest dropping \nthis service. I can imagine, however, \nother plausible scenarios that would \nlead to the opposite conclusion. \nConsider, for example, a college \nfreshman. For someone in this situation, \nit might be more important to establish \nnew friendships than to support existing \nrelationships. The activities this student \nidentifies for supporting his goal of a \nthriving social life, therefore, might\n\ninclude something like, “attend lots of \nevents and socialize with lots of \ndifferent people.” If this is a key activity, \nand you’re on a college campus, then a \ntool like Facebook would have a \nsubstantially positive impact and should  \nbe used.\nTo give another example, consider \nsomeone in the military who’s deployed \noverseas.

For this hypothetical soldier, \nkeeping in frequent lightweight touch \nwith friends and family left back home is \na plausible priority, and one that might \nonce again be best supported through \nsocial networks.\nWhat should be clear from these \nexamples is that this strategy, if applied\n\nas described, will lead many people \nwho currently use tools like Facebook or \nTwitter to abandon them—but not \neveryone. You might, at this point, \ncomplain about the arbitrariness of \nallowing only a small number of \nactivities to dominate your decisions \nabout such tools. As we established \npreviously, for example, Facebook has \nmany benefits to your social life; why \nwould one abandon it just because it \ndoesn’t happen to help the small number \nof activities that we judged most \nimportant? What’s key to understand \nhere, however, is that this radical \nreduction of priorities is not arbitrary, \nbut is instead motivated by an idea that\n\nhas arisen repeatedly in any number of \ndifferent fields, from client profitability \nto social equality to prevention of \ncrashes in computer programs.\nThe Law of the Vital Few *: In many \nsettings, 80 percent of a given effect is due \nto just 20 percent of the possible causes.\nFor example, it might be the case that \n80 percent of a business’s profits come \nfrom just 20 percent of its clients, 80 \npercent of a nation’s wealth is held by \nits richest 20 percent of citizens, or 80 \npercent of computer software crashes \ncome from just 20 percent of the \nidentified bugs. There’s a formal\n\nmathematical underpinning to this \nphenomenon (an 80/20 split is roughly \nwhat you would expect when describing \na power law  distribution over impact—a \ntype of distribution that shows up often \nwhen measuring quantities in the real \nworld), but it’s probably most useful \nwhen applied heuristically as a reminder \nthat, in many cases, contributions to an \noutcome are not evenly distributed.\nMoving forward, let’s assume that \nthis law holds for the important goals in \nyour life. As we noted, many different \nactivities can contribute to your \nachieving these goals. The law of the \nvital few, however, reminds us that the \nmost important 20 percent or so of these\n\nactivities provide the bulk of the benefit. \nAssuming that you could probably list \nsomewhere between ten and fifteen \ndistinct and potentially beneficial \nactivities for each of your life goals, this \nlaw says that it’s the top two or three \nsuch activities—the number that this \nstrategy asks you to focus on—that make \nmost of the difference in whether or not \nyou succeed with the goal.\nEven if you accept this result, \nhowever, you still might argue that you \nshouldn’t ignore the other 80 percent of \npossible beneficial activities. It’s true \nthat these less important activities don’t \ncontribute nearly as much to your goal as \nyour top one or two, but they can\n\nprovide some  benefit, so why not keep \nthem in the mix? As long as you don’t \nignore the more important activities, it \nseems like it can’t hurt to also support \nsome of the less important alternatives.\nThis argument, however, misses the \nkey point that all activities, regardless of \ntheir importance, consume your same \nlimited store of time and attention. If you \nservice low-impact activities, therefore, \nyou’re taking away time you could be \nspending on higher-impact activities. It’s \na zero-sum game.

This is why it’s not uncommon to \nsee a company fire unproductive clients. \nIf 80 percent of their profits come from \n20 percent of their clients, then they \nmake more money by redirecting the \nenergy from low-revenue clients to \nbetter service the small number of \nlucrative contracts—each hour spent on \nthe latter returns more revenue than each \nhour spent on the former.

He spent an afternoon packing \neverything he owned into cardboard \nboxes as if he was about to move.

Given these \ndangers, you might expect that more \nknowledge workers would avoid these \ntools altogether—especially those like \ncomputer programmers or writers whose \nlivelihood explicitly depends on the \noutcome of deep work. But part of what \nmakes social media insidious is that the \ncompanies that profit from your attention \nhave succeeded with a masterful \nmarketing coup: convincing our culture \nthat if you don’t use their products you \nmight miss out.\n\nThis fear that you might miss out has \nobvious parallels to Nicodemus’s fear \nthat the voluminous stuff in his closets \nmight one day prove useful, which is \nwhy I’m suggesting a corrective strategy \nthat parallels his packing party. By \nspending a month without these services, \nyou can replace your fear that you might \nmiss out—on events, on conversations, \non shared cultural experience—with a \ndose of reality. For most people this \nreality will confirm something that \nseems obvious only once you’ve done \nthe hard work of freeing yourself from \nthe marketing messages surrounding \nthese tools: They’re not really all that \nimportant in your life.\n\nThe reason why I ask you to not \nannounce your thirty-day experiment is \nbecause for some people another part of \nthe delusion that binds them to social \nmedia is the idea that people want to  \nhear what you have to say , and that they \nmight be disappointed if you suddenly \nleave them bereft of your commentary. \nI’m being somewhat facetious here in my \nwording, but this underlying sentiment is \nnonetheless common and important to \ntackle. As of this writing, for example, \nthe average number of followers for a \nTwitter user is 208. When you know that \nmore than two hundred people \nvolunteered  to hear what you have to \nsay, it’s easy to begin to believe that\n\nyour activities on these services are \nimportant. Speaking from experience as \nsomeone who makes a living trying to \nsell my ideas to people: This is a \npowerfully addictive feeling!\nBut here’s the reality of audiences in \na social media era. Before these \nservices existed, building an audience of \nany size beyond your immediate friends \nand family required hard, competitive \nwork.

A blog or \nmagazine or television program that \ncontained the content that typically \npopulates a Facebook wall or Twitter \nfeed, for example, would attract, on \naverage, no audience.

For \nmost people and most services, the news \nmight be sobering—no one outside your \nclosest friends and family will likely\n\neven notice you’ve signed off. I \nrecognize that I come across as \ncurmudgeonly when talking about this \nissue—is there any other way to tackle \nit?—but it’s important to discuss \nbecause this quest for self-importance \nplays an important role in convincing \npeople to continue to thoughtlessly \nfragment their time and attention.\nFor some people, of course, this \nthirty-day experiment will be difficult \nand generate lots of issues. If you’re a \ncollege student or online personality, for \nexample, the abstention will complicate \nyour life and will be noted. But for most, \nI suspect, the net result of this \nexperiment, if not a massive overhaul in\n\nyour Internet habits, will be a more \ngrounded view of the role social media \nplays in your daily existence. These \nservices aren’t necessarily, as \nadvertised, the lifeblood of our modern \nconnected world. They’re just products, \ndeveloped by private companies, funded \nlavishly, marketed carefully, and \ndesigned ultimately to capture then sell \nyour personal information and attention \nto advertisers. They can be fun, but in \nthe scheme of your life and what you \nwant to accomplish, they’re a \nlightweight whimsy, one unimportant \ndistraction among many threatening to \nderail you from something deeper. Or \nmaybe social media tools are at the core\n\nof your existence. You won’t know \neither way until you sample life without \nthem.\nDon’t Use the Internet to \nEntertain Yourself\nArnold Bennett was an English writer \nborn near the turn of the twentieth \ncentury—a tumultuous time for his home \ncountry’s economy. The industrial \nrevolution, which had been roaring for \ndecades by this point, had wrenched \nenough surplus capital from the empire’s \nresources to generate a new class: the \nwhite-collar worker.

This hypothetical London \nsalaryman, he notes, has a little more \nthan sixteen hours left in the day beyond \nthese work-related hours. To Bennett, \nthis is a lot of time, but most people in \nthis situation tragically don’t realize its \npotential. The “great and profound \nmistake which my typical man makes in \nregard to his day,” he elaborates, is that \neven though he doesn’t particularly \nenjoy his work (seeing it as something to \n“get through”), “he persists in looking \nupon those hours from ten to six as ‘the \nday,’  to which the ten hours preceding \nthem and the six hours following them\n\nare nothing but a prologue and \nepilogue.” This is an attitude that \nBennett condemns as “utterly illogical \nand unhealthy.”\nWhat’s the alternative to this state of \naffairs? Bennett suggests that his typical \nman see his sixteen free hours as a “day \nwithin a day,” explaining, “during those \nsixteen hours he is f ree; he is not a \nwage-earner; he is not preoccupied with \nmonetary cares; he is just as good as a \nman with a private income.” \nAccordingly, the typical man should \ninstead use this time as an aristocrat \nwould: to perform rigorous self-\nimprovement—a task that, according to \nBennett, involves, primarily, reading\n\ngreat literature and poetry.\nBennett wrote about these issues \nmore than a century ago. You might \nexpect that in the intervening decades, a \nperiod in which this middle class \nexploded in size worldwide, our \nthinking about leisure time would have \nevolved. But it has not.

If\n\nBennett were brought back to life today, \nhe’d likely fall into despair at the lack of \nprogress in this area of human \ndevelopment.\nTo be clear, I’m indifferent to the \nmoral underpinnings behind Bennett’s \nsuggestions. His vision of elevating the \nsouls and minds of the middle class by \nreading poetry and great books feels \nsomewhat antiquated and classist. But \nthe logical foundation of his proposal, \nthat you both should  and can make \ndeliberate use of your time outside \nwork, remains relevant today— \nespecially with respect to the goal of \nthis rule, which is to reduce the impact \nof network tools on your ability to\n\nperform deep work.\nIn more detail, in the strategies \ndiscussed so far in this rule, we haven’t \nspent much time yet on a class of \nnetwork tools that are particularly \nrelevant to the fight for depth: \nentertainment-focused websites designed \nto capture and hold your attention for as \nlong as possible. At the time of this \nwriting, the most popular examples of \nsuch sites include the Huffington Post, \nBuzzFeed, Business Insider, and Reddit. \nThis list will undoubtedly continue to \nevolve, but what this general category of \nsites shares is the use o f carefully \ncrafted titles and easily digestible \ncontent, often honed by algorithms to be\n\nmaximally attention catching.\nOnce you’ve landed on one article in \none of these sites, links on the side or \nbottom of the page beckon you to click \non another, then another. Every available \ntrick of human psychology, from listing \ntitles as “popular” or “trending,” to the \nuse of arresting photos, is used to keep \nyou engaged. At this particular moment, \nfor example, some of the most popular \narticles on BuzzFeed include, “17 Words \nThat Mean Something Totally Different \nWhen Spelled Backward” and “33 Dogs \nWinning at Everything.”\nThese sites are especially harmful \nafter the workday is over, where the \nfreedom in your schedule enables them\n\nto become central to your leisure time. If \nyou’re waiting in line, or waiting for the \nplot to pick up in a TV show, or waiting \nto finish eating a meal, they provide a \ncognitive crutch to ensure you eliminate \nany chance of boredom As I argued in \nRule #2, however, such behavior is \ndangerous, as it weakens your mind’s \ngeneral ability to resist distraction, \nmaking deep work difficult later when \nyou really want to concentrate. To make \nmatters worse, these network tools are \nnot something you join and therefore \nthey’re not something you can remove \nfrom your life by quitting (rendering the \nprevious two strategies irrelevant). \nThey’re always available, just a quick\n\nclick away.\nFortunately, Arnold Bennett \nidentified the solution to this problem a \nhundred years earlier: Put more thought  \ninto your leisure time.  In other words, \nthis strategy suggests that when it comes \nto your relaxation, don’t default to \nwhatever catches your attention at the \nmoment, but instead dedicate some \nadvance thinking to the question of how \nyou want to spend your “day within a \nday.” Addictive websites of the type \nmentioned previously thrive in a \nvacuum: If you haven’t given yourself \nsomething to do in a given moment, \nthey’ll always beckon as an appealing \noption. If you instead fill this free time\n\nwith something of more quality, their \ngrip on your attention will loosen.\nIt’s crucial, therefore, that you figure \nout in advance what you’re going to do \nwith your evenings and weekends before \nthey begin. Structured hobbies provide \ngood fodder for these hours, as they \ngenerate specific actions with specific \ngoals to fill your time. A set program of \nreading, a la Bennett, where you spend \nregular time each night making progress \non a series of deliberately chosen books, \nis also a good option, as is, of course, \nexercise or the enjoyment of good (in­\nperson) company.\nIn my own life, for example, I \nmanage to read a surprising number of\n\nbooks in a typical year, given the \ndemands on my time as a professor, \nwriter, and father (on average, I’m \ntypically reading three to five books at a \ntime).

This is possible because one of \nmy favorite preplanned leisure activities \nafter my kids’  bedtime is to read an \ninteresting book. As a result, my \nsmartphone and computer, and the \ndistractions they can offer, typically \nremain neglected between the end of the \nworkday and the next morning.\nAt this point you might worry that \nadding such structure to your relaxation \nwill defeat the purpose of relaxing, \nwhich many believe requires complete \nfreedom from plans or obligations.\n\nWon’t a structured evening leave you \nexhausted—not refreshed—the next day \nat work? Bennett, to his credit, \nanticipated this complaint. As he argues, \nsuch worries misunderstand what \nenergizes the human spirit:\nWhat? You say that fu ll energy  \ngiven to those sixteen hours will  \nlessen the value o f the business  \neight? Not so. On the contrary, it  \nwill assuredly increase the value  \no f the business eight. One o f the  \nchief things which my typical  \nman has to learn is that the  \nmental faculties are capable o f a  \ncontinuous hard activity; they do\n\nnot tire like an arm or a leg. All  \nthey want is change—not rest,  \nexcept in sleep.\nIn my experience, this analysis is \nspot-on. If you give your mind something \nmeaningful to do throughout all your \nwaking hours, you’ll end the day more \nfulfilled, and begin the next one more \nrelaxed, than if you instead allow your \nmind to bathe for hours in semiconscious \nand unstructured Web surfing.\nTo summarize, if you want to \neliminate the addictive pull of \nentertainment sites on your time and \nattention, give your brain a quality \nalternative. Not only will this preserve\n\nyour ability to resist distraction and \nconcentrate, but you might even fulfill \nArnold Bennett’s ambitious goal of \nexperiencing, perhaps for the first time, \nwhat it means to live, and not just exist.",
