Ma stering the \nart of stress-free productivity requires it. \nWorking from the Bottom Up \nIn order to create productive alignment in your lif e, you could quite \nreasonably start with a clarification from the top down. Decide why \nyou're on the planet. Figure out what kind of life and \nwork and life-style would best allow you to fulfill  that \ncontract. What kind of job and personal relationshi ps \nwould support that direction? What key things would\nyou need to put in place and make happen right now,\nand what could you do physically as soon as possibl e, \nto kick-start each of those? \nIn truth, you can approach your priorities from \nany level, at any time. I always have something tha t I \ncould do constructively to enhance my awareness and  focus on \neach level. I'm never lacking in more visions to el aborate, goals to \nreassess, projects to identify or create, or action s to decide on. The \ntrick is to learn to pay attention to the ones you need to at the \nappropriate time, to keep you and your systems in b alance. \nBecause everything will ultimately be driven by the  priorities \nof the level above it, any formulation of your prio rities would \nobviously most efficiently begin at the top.

Pay attention \nto which horizon is \ncalling you. \nCHAPTER 9 1  DOING: MAKING THE BEST ACTION CHOICES \ning the next job you really want. The problem is th at without a \nsense of control at the implementation levels (curr ent projects and \nactions), and without inner trust in your own abili ty to manage \nthose levels appropriately, trying to manage yourse lf from the top \ndown often creates frustration. \nFrom a practical perspective, I suggest going \nfrom the bottom up instead. I've coached people \nfrom both directions, and in terms of lasting value , I \ncan honestly say that getting someone in control of\nthe details of his or her current physical world, a nd \nthen elevating the focus from there, has never \nmissed. \nThe primary reason to work from this bottom- \nup direction is that it clears the psychic decks to  begin with, \nallowing your creative attention to focus on the mo re meaningful \nand elusive visions that you may need to challenge yourself to \nidentify. Also, this particular method has a high d egree of flexibil- \nity and freedom, and it includes a thinking and org anizing prac- \ntice that is universal and effective no matter what  it's focused on. \nThat makes it worth learning, no matter what the ac tual content \nyou're dealing with at the moment may be. Change yo ur mind, \nand this process will help you adjust with maximum speed. And \nknowing that you have that ability will give you pe rmission to \nplay a bigger game. It's truly empowering. \nWhile the \"50,000-foot level\" is obviously the most  important \ncontext within which to set priorities, experience has shown me \nthat when we understand and implement all the levels of work \nin which we are engaged, especially the runway and 10,000-foot \nlevels, we gain greater freedom and resources to do  the bigger \nwork that we're all about. Although a bottom-up app roach is \nnot a key conceptual priority, from a practical per spective it's \na critical factor in achieving a balanced, producti ve, and comfort- \nable life. \n203 Trying to manage \nfrom the top down,\nwhen the bottom is \nout of control, may \nbe the least\neffective approach.\nPRACTICING",

Thos e who focus on \ngathering and objectifying all of those items disco ver that there \nare many they've forgotten, misplaced, or just not recognized. \nAside from your calendar, if you don't have at leas t fifty next \nactions and waiting-fors, including all the agendas  for people and \nmeetings, I would be skeptical about whether you re ally had all of \nthem. If you've followed through rigorously with th e steps and \nsuggestions in part 2, though, you may have them al ready. If not, \nand you do want to get this level up-to-date, set a side some time \nto work through chapters 4 through 6 in real implem entation \nmode. \nWhen you've finished getting this level of control current, \nyou'll automatically have a more grounded sense of immediate \npriorities, which is almost impossible to achieve o therwise. \n10,000 Feet Finalize your \"Projects\" list. Does it \ntruly capture all the commitments you have that wil l \nrequire more than one action to get done? That will\ndefine the boundaries of the kind of week-to-week \noperational world you're in and allow you to relax \nyour thinking for longer intervals. \nIf you make a complete list of all of the things \nyou want to have happen in your life and work at th is \nlevel, you'll discover that there are actions you n eed \nto do that you hadn't realized. Just creating this objective inven- \ntory will give you a firmer basis on which to make decisions about \nwhat to do when you have discretionary time. Invari ably when \npeople get their \"Projects\" list up-to-date, they d iscover there are \nseveral things that could be done readily to move t hings they care \nabout forward. \nVery few people have this clear data defined and av ailable to \nthemselves in some objective form. Before any discu ssion about \nwhat should be done this afternoon can take place, this informa- \ntion must be at hand. \n204 Taking the inventory \nof your current \nwork at all levels \nwill automatically \nproduce greater \nfocus, alignment, \nand sense of \npriorities. \nCHAPTER 9  |  DOING: MAKING THE BEST ACTION CHOICES \nAgain, if you've been putting into practice the met hodology \nof Getting Things Done, your \"Projects\" list will be where it needs \nto be. For most of our coaching clients, it takes t en to fifteen \nhours of collecting, processing, and organizing to get to the point \nof trusting the thoroughness of their inventory. \n20,000 Feet This is the level of \"current job responsibilities. \" \nWhat are the \"hats\" you wear? Professionally, this would relate to \nyour current position and work. Personally, it woul d include the \nroles you've taken on in your family, in your commu nity, and of \ncourse with yourself as a functioning person. \nYou may have some of these roles already defined an d \nwritten out. If you've recently taken a new positio n and there's \nan agreement or contract about your areas of respon sibility, \n that would certainly be a good start. If you've do ne any kind \nof personal goal-setting and values-clarifying exer cises in the \npast and still have any materials you created then,  add those to the \nmix. \nNext I recommend that you make and keep a list call ed \n\"Areas of Focus.\" You might like to separate this i nto \"Profes- \nsional\" and \"Personal\" sublists, in which case you' ll want to use \nthem both equally for a consistent review This is o ne of the most \nuseful checklists you can create for your own self- management. It \nwon't require the kind of once-a-week recalibration\nthat the \"Projects\" list will; more likely it will have \nmeaning on a longer recursion cycle. Depending on \nthe speed of change in some of the more important \nareas of your life and work, this should be used as  a \ntrigger for potential new projects every one to thr ee \nmonths. \nYou probably have somewhere between four and seven key \nareas of responsibility in your work, and a similar  number person- \nally. Your job may include things like staff develo pment, systems \ndesign, long-range planning",

Instead of managing the production of your own \ntraining programs in-house, you're going to outsour ce them to \nvendors. \n• The direction in which you feel you need to move in  your \ncareer. You see yourself doing a different kind of job a year \nfrom now, and you need to make a transition out of the one \nyou have while exploring the options for a transfer  or \npromotion. \n• The organization direction, given globalization and  expansion. \nYou see a lot of major international travel looming  on the \nhorizon for you, and given your life-style preferen ces, you need \nto consider how to readjust your career plans. \n• Life-style preferences and changing needs. As your kids get \nolder, your need to be at home with them is diminis hing, and \nyour interest in investment and retirement planning  is growing. \nAt the topmost level of thinking, you'll need to as k some of \nthe ultimate questions. Why does your company exist ? Why do \nyou exist? What is the core DNA of your existence, pers onally \nand/or organizationally, that drives your choices. This is the \"big \npicture\" stuff with which hundreds of books and gur us and mod- \nels are devoted to helping you grapple. \n\"Why?\": this is the great question with which we al l struggle. \nYou can have all the other levels of your life and work ship- \nshape, defined, and organized to a T. Still, if you 're the slightest \nbit off course in terms of what at the deepest leve l you want or are \ncalled to be doing, you're going to be uncomfortabl e.",
