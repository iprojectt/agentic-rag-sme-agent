Personal and professional\nimprovement is one of the best time savers there is. The better you\nare at a key task, the more motivated you are to launch into it. The\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 73better you are, the more energy and enthusiasm you have. When you\nknow that you can do a job well, you find it easier to overcome\nprocrastination and get the job done faster and better than under any\nother circumstances.\nOne piece of information or one additional skill can make an\nenormous difference in your ability to do the job well. Identify the\nmost important things you do and then make a plan to continuallyupgrade your skills in those areas.\nRule: “Continuous learning is the minimum requirement for success\nin any field.”\nRefuse to allow a weakness or a lack of ability in any area to hold youback.

I soon realized\nthat I had to learn to touch-type if I was ever going to write and\nrewrite a 300-page book. So I bought a touch-typing program for my\ncomputer and practiced for 20 to 30 minutes every day for threemonths. By the end of that time, I was typing 40-50 words per\nminute. With this additional skill, I have been able to write more than\nforty books that have now been published all over the world.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 74The best news is that you can learn whatever skills you need to be\nmore productive and more effective. You can become a touch typist if\nnecessary. You can become proficient expert with a computer. You\ncan become a terrific negotiator or a super salesperson. You can learnto speak in public. You can learn to write effectively and well. Theseare all skills you can acquire, as soon as you decide to, and make\nthem a priority.\nThree Steps to Mastery\nFirst, read in your field for at least one hour every day. Get up a little\nearlier in the morning and read for 30-60 minutes in a book ormagazine that contains information that can help you to be more\neffective and productive at what you do.\nSecond, take every course and seminar available on key skills that\ncan help you. Attend the conventions and business meetings of your\nprofession or occupation. Go to the sessions and workshops. Sit up\nfront and take notes. Purchase the audio recordings of the programs.\nDedicate yourself to becoming one of the most knowledgeable and\ncompetent people in your field.\nThird, listen to audio programs in your car. The average car owner\nsits behind the wheel 500-1000 hours each year while driving from\nplace to place. Turn driving time into learning time. You can become\none of the smartest, most capable and highest paid people in your\nfield simply by listening to educational audio programs as you drive\naround.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 75The more you learn and know, the more confident and motivated\nyou feel. You better you become, the more capable you will be of\ndoing even more in your field.\nThe more you learn, the more you can learn. Just as you can build\nyour physical muscles through physical exercise, you build your\nmental muscles with mental exercises. And there is no limit to how\nfar or how fast you can advance except for the limits you place onyour own imagination.\nEat That Frog!\n1.  Resolve today to become a “Do-It-To-Yourself” project.",
