I want to complete a project  \n2. I want to improve my performance  \n   \nThis is a typical approach to creating goals, but both of these are very vague. With the current \nwording, the goals probably aren’t going to be attainable. The statements lack specifics, \ntimelines, motivation, and a reality check.   \nNow, let’s use the S.M.A.R.T. goals formula to clarify  both and create new and improved goals.  \n \n \nGoal: I want to complete a project  \n Specific:  Many people are accessing our current site from their mobile devices. Since it’s \nnot a responsive site, it provides a poor experience for customers. I want to launch a  \nmobile app for my company website by the end of June , which requires involvement \nfrom software development, design, and marketing.  \n Measurable : Creating a mobile app for our company site will require a lot of resources. \nTo make it worthwhile, I’d like to h ave 50,000 installs of the site within six months of \nlaunch. I’d also like to show a 5% conversion rate from customers using the mobile site.  \n Achievable : The departments that will be involved have signed -off on creating a mobile \napp. I’ll need to manage th e project and set milestones to keep everyone motivated and \non target.  \n Relevant : Improving the customer experience on mobile devices is a core initiative for \nmy company this year.  \n Time -Bound : In order to achieve 50,000 mobile app installs and a 5% conversi on rate by \nthe end of the fiscal year, the app will need to be launched by Q2 with a robust \nmarketing campaign that should continue through the end of the year.  \nPerformance Appraisal Planning 2016 -2017    SMART Goals: A How to  Guide  \n \n \n8 \n  \nGoal: I want to improve my performance  \n Specific : I received low marks on my ability to use PowerPoint at my last performance \nreview. Improving my skills requires that I learn how to use PowerPoint efficiently and \npractice using it by creating various presentations. I’d like to be more proficient using \nPowerPoint in time for my next review in six  months.  \n Measurable : By the time of my next review, I should be able to create presentations \nthat incorporate graphs, images, and other media in a couple of hours. I should also be \nable to efficiently use and create templates in PowerPoint that my coworker s can also \nuse.  \n Achievable : Improving my PowerPoint skills is instrumental in moving forward in my \ncareer and receiving a better performance review. I can set time aside every week to \nwatch PowerPoint tutorials and even enroll in an online class that can teach me new \nskills. I can also ask coworkers and my manager for PowerPoint tips.  \n Relevant : Working with PowerPoint is currently 25% of my job. As I move up in the \ncompany, I’ll need to spend 50% of my time creating PowerPoint presentations. I enjoy \nmy car eer and want to continue to grow within this company.  \n Time -Bound : In six months, I should be proficient in PowerPoint ensuring it only \noccupies 25% of my workload instead of the nearly 40% of the time it occupies now.  \n   \n \nOnce you go through and write your  goals according to each S.M.A.R.T. characteristic, you can \nthen combine and consolidate all the work you’ve done into one S.M.A.R.T. goal.  \n   \n \nS.M.A.R.T. goal: I want to complete a project  \n Description : Improving the customer experience on mobile devices is a core initiative \nfor my company this year, so we are going to create a mobile app. By the end of the \nfiscal year, there should be 50,000 installs of the mobile app we develop, and it should \nproduce a 5% conversion rate. We’ll build the mobile app in -house and launch it by the \nend of June  with an app -related marketing campaign that will continue to the end of the \nyear.  \n Milestone : Mobile app launches end of June . \nPerformance Appraisal Planning 2016 -2017    SMART Goals",
