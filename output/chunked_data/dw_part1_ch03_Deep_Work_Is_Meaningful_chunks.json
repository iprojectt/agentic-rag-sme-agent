    "text": "Chapter Three\nDeep Work Is  \nMeaningful\nRic Furrer is a blacksmith. He \nspecializes in ancient and medieval \nmetalworking practices, which he \npainstakingly re-creates in his shop, \nDoor County Forgeworks. “I do all my \nwork by hand and use tools that multiply\n\nmy force without limiting my creativity \nor interaction with the material,” he \nexplains in his artist’s statement. “What \nmay take me 100 blows by hand can be \naccomplished in one by a large swaging \nmachine. This is the antithesis of my \ngoal and to that end all my work shows \nevidence of the two hands that made it.” \nA 2012 PBS documentary provides a \nglimpse into Furrer’s world. We learn \nthat he works in a converted barn in \nWisconsin farm country, not far inland \nfrom the scenic Sturgeon Bay of Lake \nMichigan. Furrer often leaves the barn \ndoors open (to vent the heat of the \nforges, one suspects), his efforts framed \nby farm fields stretching to the horizon.\n\nThe setting is idyllic but the work can \nseem, at first encounter, brutish. In the \ndocumentary, Furrer is trying to re­\ncreate a Viking-era sword. He begins by \nusing a fifteen-hundred-year-old \ntechnique to smelt crucible steel :  an \nunusually pure (for the period) form of \nthe metal. The result is an ingot, not \nmuch bigger than three or four stacked \nsmartphones. This dense ingot must then \nbe shaped and polished into a long and \nelegant sword blade.\n“This part, the initial breakdown, is \nterrible,” Furrer says to the camera as he \nmethodically heats the ingot, hits it with \na hammer, turns it, hits it, then puts it \nback in the flames to start over. The\n\nnarrator reveals that it will take eight  \nhours  of this hammering to complete the \nshaping. As you watch Furrer work, \nhowever, the sense of the labor shifts. It \nbecomes clear that he’s not drearily \nwhacking at the metal like a miner with a \npickaxe: Every hit, though forceful, is \ncarefully controlled. He peers intently at \nthe metal, through thin-framed \nintellectual glasses (which seem out of \nplace perched above his heavy beard \nand broad shoulders), turning it just so  \nfor each impact. “You have to be very \ngentle with it or you will crack it,” he \nexplains. After a few more hammer \nstrikes, he adds: “You have to nudge it; \nslowly it breaks down; then you start to\n\nenjoy it.”\nAt one point about halfway through \nthe smithing, after Furrer has finished \nhammering out the desired shape, he \nbegins rotating the metal carefully in a \nnarrow trough of burning charcoal. As \nhe stares at the blade something clicks: \n“It’s ready.” He lifts the sword, red with \nheat, holding it away from his body as he \nstrides swiftly toward a pipe filled with \noil and plunges in the blade to cool it. \nAfter a moment of relief that the blade \ndid not crack into pieces— a common \noccurrence at this step—Furrer pulls it \nfrom the oil. The residual heat of the \nmetal lights the fuel, engulfing the \nsword’s full length in yellow flames.\n\nFurrer holds the burning sword up above \nhis head with a single powerful arm and \nstares at it a moment before blowing out \nthe fire. During this brief pause, the \nflames illuminate his face, and his \nadmiration is palpable.\n“To do it right, it is the most \ncomplicated thing I know how to make,” \nFurrer explains. “And it’s that challenge \nthat drives me. I don’t need a sword. But \nI have  to make them.”\nRic Furrer is a master craftsman whose \nwork requires him to spend most of his \nday in a state of depth—even a small \nslip in concentration can ruin dozens of \nhours of effort. He’s also someone who\n\nclearly finds great meaning in his \nprofession. This connection between \ndeep work and a good life is familiar \nand widely accepted when considering \nthe world of craftsmen. “The \nsatisfactions of manifesting oneself \nconcretely in the world through manual \ncompetence have been known to make a \nman quiet and easy,” explains Matthew \nCrawford. And we believe him\nBut when we shift our attention to \nknowledge work this connection is \nmuddied. Part of the issue is clarity. \nCraftsmen like Furrer tackle \nprofessional",

Part of the issue is clarity. \nCraftsmen like Furrer tackle \nprofessional challenges that are simple \nto define but difficult to execute— a \nuseful imbalance when seeking purpose.\n\nKnowledge work exchanges this clarity \nfor ambiguity. It can be hard to define \nexactly what a given knowledge worker \ndoes and how it differs from another: On \nour worst days, it can seem that all \nknowledge work boils down to the same \nexhausting roil of e-mails and \nPowerPoint, with only the charts used in \nthe slides differentiating one career from \nanother. Furrer himself identifies this \nblandness when he writes: “The world \nof information superhighways and cyber \nspace has left me rather cold and \ndisenchanted.”\nAnother issue muddying the \nconnection between depth and meaning \nin knowledge work is the cacophony of\n\nvoices attempting to convince \nknowledge workers to spend more time \nengaged in shallow activities. As \nelaborated in the last chapter, we live in \nan era where anything Internet related is \nunderstood by default to be innovative \nand necessary. Depth-destroying \nbehaviors such as immediate e-mail \nresponses and an active social media \npresence are lauded, while avoidance of \nthese trends generates suspicion.

The thesis of this final \nchapter in Part 1, therefore, is that a \ndeep life is not just economically \nlucrative, but also a life well lived.\nA Neurological Argument for \nDepth\nThe science writer Winifred Gallagher \nstumbled onto a connection between \nattention and happiness after an \nunexpected and terrifying event, a cancer \ndiagnosis— “not just cancer,” she \nclarifies, “but a particularly nasty, fairly\n\nadvanced kind.” As Gallagher recalls in \nher 2009 book Rapt , as she walked \naway from the hospital after the \ndiagnosis she formed a sudden and \nstrong intuition: “This disease wanted to \nmonopolize my attention, but as much as \npossible, I would focus on my life \ninstead.” The cancer treatment that \nfollowed was exhausting and terrible, \nbut Gallagher couldn’t help noticing, in \nthat corner of her brain honed by a \ncareer in nonfiction writing, that her \ncommitment to focus on what was good \nin her life—“movies, walks, and a 6:30 \nmartini”—worked surprisingly well. \nHer life during this period should have \nbeen mired in fear and pity, but it was\n\ninstead, she noted, often quite pleasant.\nHer curiosity piqued, Gallagher set \nout to better understand the role that \nattention—that is, what we choose to \nfocus on and what we choose to ignore \n—plays in defining the quality of our \nlife. After five years of science \nreporting, she came away convinced that \nshe was witness to a “grand unified \ntheory” of the mind:\nLike fingers pointing to the  \nmoon, other diverse disciplines  \nfrom anthropology to education,  \nbehavioral economics to family  \ncounseling, similarly suggest  \nthat the skillful management o f\n\nattention is the sine qua non o f  \nthe good life and the key to  \nimproving virtually every aspect  \no f your experience.\nThis concept upends the way most \npeople think about their subjective \nexperience of life. We tend to place a lot \nof emphasis on our circumstances , \nassuming that what happens to us (or \nfails to happen) determines how we feel. \nFrom this perspective, the small-scale \ndetails of how you spend your day aren’t \nthat important, because what matters are \nthe large-scale outcomes, such as \nwhether or not you get a promotion or \nmove to that nicer",

According\n\nto Gallagher, decades of research \ncontradict this understanding. Our brains \ninstead construct our worldview based \non what we pay attention to.  If you \nfocus on a cancer diagnosis, you and \nyour life become unhappy and dark, but \nif you focus instead on an evening \nmartini, you and your life become more \npleasant—even though the circumstances \nin both scenarios are the same. As \nGallagher summarizes: “Who you are, \nwhat you think, feel, and do, what you \nlove— is the sum of what you focus on.” \nIn Rapt , Gallagher surveys the \nresearch supporting this understanding of \nthe mind. She cites, for example, the \nUniversity of North Carolina\n\npsychologist Barbara Fredrickson: a \nresearcher who specializes in the \ncognitive appraisal of emotions. After a \nbad or disrupting occurrence in your \nlife, Fredrickson’s research shows, what \nyou choose to focus on exerts significant \nleverage on your attitude going forward. \nThese simple choices can provide a \n“reset button” to your emotions. She \nprovides the example of a couple \nfighting over inequitable splitting of \nhousehold chores. “Rather than \ncontinuing to focus on your partner’s \nselfishness and sloth,” she suggests, \n“you might focus on the fact that at least \na festering conflict has been aired, \nwhich is the first step toward a solution\n\nto the problem, and to your improved \nmood.” This seems like a simple \nexhortation to look on the bright side, but \nFredrickson found that skillful use of \nthese emotional “leverage points” can \ngenerate a significantly more positive \noutcome after negative events.\nScientists can watch this effect in \naction all the way down to the \nneurological level. Stanford \npsychologist Laura Carstensen, to name \none such example, used an fMRI scanner \nto study the brain behavior of subjects \npresented with both positive and \nnegative imagery. She found that for \nyoung people, their amygdala (a center \nof emotion) fired with activity at both\n\ntypes of imagery. When she instead \nscanned the elderly, the amygdala fired \nonly for the positive images. Carstensen \nhypothesizes that the elderly subjects \nhad trained the prefrontal cortex to \ninhibit the amygdala in the presence of \nnegative stimuli.

This \nmessage was in response to a \nstandard scam in which a company \ntries to trick website owners into \nregistering their domain in China. I \nwas annoyed that they kept \nspamming me, so I lost my cool \nand responded (futilely, of course) \nby telling them their scam would \nbe more convincing if they spelled \n“website” correctly in their e­\nmails.\n• Re: S R. This message was a \nconversation with a family \nmember about an article he saw in \nthe Wall Street Journal.\n\n• Re: Important Advice. This e­\nmail was part of a conversation \nabout optimal retirement \ninvestment strategies.\n• Re: Fwd: Study Hacks. This e­\nmail was part of a conversation in \nwhich I was attempting to find a \ntime to meet with someone I know \nwho was visiting my city—a task \ncomplicated by his fractured \nschedule during his visit.\n• Re: just curious. This message \nwas part of a conversation in \nwhich a colleague and I were \nreacting to some thorny office \npolitics issues (of the type that are\n\nfrequent and cliched in academic \ndepartments).\nThese e-mails provide a nice case \nstudy of the type of shallow concerns \nthat vie for your attention in a knowledge \nwork setting. Some of the issues \npresented in these sample messages are \nbenign, such as discussing an interesting \narticle, some are vaguely stressful, such \nas the conversation on retirement \nsavings strategies (a type of \nconversation which almost always \nconcludes with you not doing the right \nthings), some are frustrating, such as \ntrying to arrange a meeting around busy \nschedules, and some are explicitly\n\nnegative, such as angry responses to \nscammers or worried discussions about \noffice politics.\nMany knowledge workers spend \nmost of their working day interacting \nwith these types of shallow concerns. \nEven when they’re required to complete \nsomething more involved, the habit of \nfrequently checking inboxes ensures that \nthese issues remain at the forefront of \ntheir attention. Gallagher teaches us that \nthis is a foolhardy way to go about your \nday, as it ensures that your mind will \nconstruct an understanding of your \nworking life that’s dominated by stress, \nirritation, frustration, and triviality. The \nworld represented by your inbox, in\n\nother words, isn’t a pleasant world to \ninhabit.\nEven if your colleagues are all genial \nand your interactions are always upbeat \nand positive, by allowing your attention \nto drift over the seductive landscape of \nthe shallow, you run the risk of falling \ninto another neurological trap identified \nby Gallagher: “Five years of reporting \non attention have confirmed some home \ntruths,” Gallagher reports. “[Among \nthem is the notion that] ‘the idle mind is \nthe devil’s workshop’... when you lose \nfocus, your mind tends to fix on what \ncould be wrong with your life instead of \nwhat’s right.” A workday driven by the \nshallow, from a neurological\n\nperspective, is likely to be a draining \nand upsetting day, even if most of the \nshallow things that capture your attention \nseem harmless or fun.\nThe implication of these findings is \nclear.

    "text": ", working with Reed \nLarson, a young colleague at the \nUniversity of Chicago, invented a new\n\ntechnique for understanding the \npsychological impact of everyday \nbehaviors. At the time, it was difficult to \naccurately measure the psychological \nimpact of different activities. If you \nbrought someone into a laboratory and \nasked her to remember how she felt at a \nspecific point many hours ago, she was \nunlikely to recall. If you instead gave her \na diary and asked her to record how she \nfelt throughout the day, she wouldn’t be \nlikely to keep up the entries with \ndiligence—it’s simply too much work.\nCsikszentmihalyi and Larson’s \nbreakthrough was to leverage new \ntechnology (for the time) to bring the \nquestion to the subject right when it\n\nmattered. In more detail, they outfitted \nexperimental subjects with pagers. \nThese pagers would beep at randomly \nselected intervals (in modern \nincarnations of this method, smartphone \napps play the same role). When the \nbeeper went off, the subjects would \nrecord what they were doing at the exact \nmoment and how they felt. In some \ncases, they would be provided with a \njournal in which to record this \ninformation while in others they would \nbe given a phone number to call to \nanswer questions posed by a field- \nworker. Because the beeps were only \noccasional but hard to ignore, the \nsubjects were likely to follow through\n\nwith the experimental procedure. And \nbecause the subjects were recording \nresponses about an activity at the very  \nmoment  they were engaged in it, the \nresponses were more accurate. \nCsikszentmihalyi and Larson called the \napproach the experience sampling \nmethod (ESM), and it provided \nunprecedented insight into how we \nactually feel about the beats of our daily \nlives.\nAmong many breakthroughs, \nCsikszentmihalyi’s work with ESM \nhelped validate a theory he had been \ndeveloping over the preceding decade: \n“The best moments usually occur when a \nperson’s body or mind is stretched to its\n\nlimits in a voluntary effort to accomplish \nsomething difficult and worthwhile.” \nCsikszentmihalyi calls this mental state \nflow  (a term he popularized with a 1990 \nbook of the same title). At the time, this \nfinding pushed back against conventional \nwisdom. Most people assumed (and still \ndo) that relaxation makes them happy. \nWe want to work less and spend more \ntime in the hammock. But the results \nfrom Csikszentmihalyi’s ESM studies \nreveal that most people have this wrong:\nIronically, jobs are actually  \neasier to enjoy than free time,  \nbecause like flow  activities they  \nhave built-in goals, feedback\n\nrules, and challenges, all o f  \nwhich encourage one to become  \ninvolved in one  S  work, to  \nconcentrate and lose oneself in  \nit. Free time, on the other hand,  \nis unstructured, and requires  \nmuch greater effort to be shaped  \ninto something that can be  \nenjoyed.\nWhen measured empirically, people \nwere happier at work and less happy \nrelaxing than they suspected. And as the \nESM studies confirmed, the more such \nflow experiences that occur in a given \nweek, the higher the subject’s life \nsatisfaction. Human beings, it seems, are\n\nat their best when immersed deeply in \nsomething challenging.\nThere is, of course, overlap between \nthe theory of flow and the ideas of \nWinifred Gallagher highlighted in the \nlast section. Both point toward the \nimportance of depth over shallowness, \nbut they focus on two different \nexplanations for this importance. \nGallagher’s writing emphasizes that the \ncontent  of what we focus on matters. If \nwe give rapt attention to important \nthings, and therefore also ignore shallow \nnegative things, we’ll experience our \nworking life as more important and \npositive. Csikszentmihalyi’s theory of \nflow, by contrast, is mostly agnostic to\n\nthe content of our attention. Though he \nwould likely agree with the research \ncited by Gallagher, his theory notes that \nthe feeling of going deep is in itself  very \nrewarding. Our minds like this \nchallenge, regardless of the subject.\nThe connection between deep work and \nflow should be clear: Deep work is an \nactivity well suited to generate a flow \nstate (the phrases used by \nCsikszentmihalyi to describe what \ngenerates flow include notions of \nstretching your mind to its limits, \nconcentrating, and losing yourself in an \nactivity—all of which also describe \ndeep work). And as we just learned,\n\nflow generates happiness",

And as we just learned,\n\nflow generates happiness. Combining \nthese two ideas we get a powerful \nargument from psychology in favor of \ndepth. Decades of research stemming \nfrom Csikszentmihalyi’s original ESM \nexperiments validate that the act of going \ndeep orders the consciousness in a way \nthat makes life worthwhile. \nCsikszentmihalyi even goes so far as to \nargue that modern companies should \nembrace this reality, suggesting that \n“jobs should be redesigned so that they \nresemble as closely as possible flow \nactivities.” Noting, however, that such a \nredesign would be difficult and \ndisruptive (see, for example, my \narguments from the previous chapter),\n\nCsikszentmihalyi then explains that it’s \neven more important that the individual  \nlearn how to seek out opportunities for \nflow. This, ultimately, is the lesson to \ncome away with from our brief foray \ninto the world of experimental \npsychology: To build your working life \naround the experience of flow produced \nby deep work is a proven path to deep \nsatisfaction.\nA Philosophical Argument for \nDepth\nOur final argument for the connection \nbetween depth and meaning requires us\n\nto step back from the more concrete \nworlds of neuroscience and psychology \nand instead adopt a philosophical \nperspective. I’ll turn for help in this \ndiscussion to a pair of scholars who \nknow this topic well: Hubert Dreyfus, \nwho taught philosophy at Berkeley for \nmore than four decades, and Sean \nDorrance Kelly, who at the time of this \nwriting is the chair of Harvard’s \nphilosophy department. In 2011, Dreyfus \nand Kelly published a book, All Things  \nShining,  which explores how notions of \nsacredness and meaning have evolved \nthroughout the history of human culture. \nThey set out to reconstruct this history \nbecause they’re worried about its\n\nendpoint in our current era. “The world \nused to be, in its various forms, a world \nof sacred, shining things,” Dreyfus and \nKelly explain early in the book. “The \nshining things now seem far away.”\nWhat happened between then and \nnow? The short answer, the authors \nargue, is Descartes. From Descartes’s \nskepticism came the radical belief that \nthe individual seeking certainty trumped \na God or king bestowing truth. The \nresulting Enlightenment, of course, led to \nthe concept of human rights and freed \nmany from oppression. But as Dreyfus \nand Kelly emphasize, for all its good in \nthe political arena, in the domain of the \nmetaphysical this thinking stripped the\n\nworld of the order and sacredness \nessential to creating meaning. In a post­\nEnlightenment world we have tasked \nourselves  to identify what’s meaningful \nand what’s not, an exercise that can seem \narbitrary and induce a creeping nihilism \n“The Enlightenment’s metaphysical \nembrace of the autonomous individual \nleads not just to a boring life,” Dreyfus \nand Kelly worry; “it leads almost \ninevitably to a nearly unlivable one.” \nThis problem might at first seem far \nremoved from our quest to understand \nthe satisfaction of depth, but when we \nproceed to Dreyfus and Kelly’s solution, \nwe will discover rich new insights into \nthe sources of meaning in professional\n\npursuits. This connection should seem \nless surprising when it’s revealed that \nDreyfus and Kelly’s response to modern \nnihilism builds on the very subject that \nopened this chapter: the craftsman.\nCraftsmanship, Dreyfus and Kelly \nargue in their book’s conclusion, \nprovides a key to reopening a sense of \nsacredness in a responsible manner. To \nillustrate this claim, they use as an \norganizing example an account of a \nmaster wheelwright—the now lost \nprofession of shaping wooden wagon \nwheels. “Because each piece of wood is \ndistinct, it has its own personality,” they \nwrite after a passage describing the \ndetails of the wheelwright’s craft. “The\n\nwoodworker has an intimate relationship \nwith the wood he works. Its subtle \nvirtues call out to be cultivated and \ncared for.” In this appreciation for the \n“subtle virtues” of his medium, they \nnote, the craftsman has stumbled onto \nsomething crucial in a post­\nEnlightenment world: a source of\nmeaning sited outside the individual. \nThe wheelwright doesn’t decide \narbitrarily which",

The look of satisfaction on \nFurrer’s face as he works to extract \nartistry from crude metals, these \nphilosophers would argue, is a look \nexpressing appreciation for something \nelusive and valuable in modernity: a \nglimpse of the sacred.\nOnce understood, we can connect \nthis sacredness inherent in traditional \ncraftsmanship to the world of knowledge \nwork. To do so, there are two key \nobservations we must first make. The \nfirst might be obvious but requires \nemphasis: There’s nothing intrinsic\nabout the manual  trades when it comes\n\nto generating this particular source of \nmeaning. Any pursuit—be it physical or \ncognitive—that supports high levels of \nskill can also generate a sense of \nsacredness.\nTo elaborate this point, let’s jump \nfrom the old-fashioned examples of \ncarving wood or smithing metal to the \nmodern example of computer \nprogramming. Consider this quote from \nthe coding prodigy Santiago Gonzalez \ndescribing his work to an interviewer:\nBeautiful code is short and  \nconcise, so if you were to give  \nthat code to another programmer  \nthey would say, “ oh, that’ s well\n\nwritten code. ”  It  S  much like as  \nif you were writing a poem.\nGonzalez discusses computer \nprogramming similarly to the way \nwoodworkers discuss their craft in the \npassages quoted by Dreyfus and Kelly.\nThe Pragmatic Programmer , a well- \nregarded book in the computer \nprogramming field, makes this \nconnection between code and old-style \ncraftsmanship more directly by quoting \nthe medieval quarry worker’s creed in \nits preface: “We who cut mere stones \nmust always be envisioning cathedrals.” \nThe book then elaborates that computer \nprogrammers must see their work in the\n\nsame way:\nWithin the overall structure o f a  \nproject there is always room fo r  \nindividuality and\ncraftsmanship... One hundred  \nyears from now, our engineering  \nmay seem as archaic as the  \ntechniques used by medieval  \ncathedral builders seem to  \ntoday s civil engineers, while our  \ncraftsmanship will still be  \nhonored.\nYou don’t, in other words, need to be \ntoiling in an open-air barn for your \nefforts to be considered the type of\n\ncraftsmanship that can generate Dreyfus \nand Kelly’s meaning. A similar potential \nfor craftsmanship can be found in most \nskilled jobs in the information economy. \nWhether you’re a writer, marketer, \nconsultant, or lawyer: Your work is \ncraft, and if you hone your ability and \napply it with respect and care, then like \nthe skilled wheelwright you can generate \nmeaning in the daily efforts of your \nprofessional life.\nIt’s here that some might respond that \ntheir  knowledge work job cannot \npossibly become such a source of \nmeaning because their job’s subject is \nmuch too mundane. But this is flawed \nthinking that our consideration of\n\ntraditional craftsmanship can help \ncorrect. In our current culture, we place \na lot of emphasis on job description. Our \nobsession with the advice to “follow \nyour passion” (the subject of my last \nbook), for example, is motivated by the \n(flawed) idea that what matters most for \nyour career satisfaction is the specifics \nof the job you choose. In this way of \nthinking, there are some rarified jobs \nthat can be a source of satisfaction— \nperhaps working in a nonprofit or \nstarting",

Put another way, a wooden \nwheel is not noble, but its shaping can \nbe. The same applies to knowledge \nwork. You don’t need a rarified job; you \nneed instead a rarified approach to your \nwork.\nThe second key observation about \nthis line o f argument is that cultivating \ncraftsmanship is necessarily a deep task \nand therefore requires a commitment to\n\ndeep work.
