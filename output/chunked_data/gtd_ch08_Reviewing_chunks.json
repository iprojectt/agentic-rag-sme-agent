Then Your Action Lists \nAfter you review all your day- and time-specific co mmitments \nand handle whatever you need to about them, your ne xt most fre- \nquent area for review will be the lists of all the actions you could \npossibly do in your current context. If you're in y our office, for \ninstance, you'll look at your lists of calls, compu ter actions, and in- \noffice things to do. This doesn't necessarily mean you will actually \nbe doing anything on those lists; you'll just evaluate them against \nthe flow of other work coming at you to ensure that  you make the \nbest choices about what to deal with. You need to f eel confident \nthat you're not missing anything critical. \nFrankly, if your calendar is trustworthy and your a ction lists \nare current, they may be the only things in the sys tem you'll need \nto refer to more than every couple of days. There h ave been many \ndays when I didn't need to look at any of my lists, in fact, because \nit was clear from the front end—my calendar—what I wouldn't \nbe \nable to do. \nThe Right Review in the Right Context \nYou may need to access any one of your lists at any  time. When \nyou and your spouse are decompressing at the end of  the day, \nand you want to be sure you'll take care of the \"bu siness\" the two \nof you manage together about home and family, you'l l want to \n183 \nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY |  PART TWO \nlook at your accumulated agendas for him or her.

Having some dedicated time in \nwhich to at least get up to the project level of th inking goes a long \nway toward making that easier. \nWhat Is the Weekly Review? \nVery simply, the Weekly Review is whatever you need  to do to get \nyour head empty again. It's going through the five phases of \nworkflow management—collecting, processing, organiz ing, and \nreviewing all your outstanding involvements—until y ou can hon- \nestly say, \"I absolutely know right now everything I'm not doing \nbut could be doing if I decided to.\" \nFrom a nitty-gritty, practical standpoint, here is the drill that \ncan get you there: \nLoose Papers Pull out all miscellaneous scraps of paper, busines s \ncards, receipts, and so on that have crept into the  crevices of your \ndesk, clothing, and accessories. Put it all into yo ur in-basket for \nprocessing. \nProcess Your Notes Review any journal entries, meeting notes, or \nmiscellaneous notes scribbled on notebook paper. Li st action \nitems, projects, waiting-fors, calendar events, and  someday/ \nmaybes, as appropriate. File any reference notes an d materials. \nStage your \"Read/Renew\" material. Be ruthless with yourself, \n185 You will invariably \ntake in more \nopportunities than \nyour system can \nprocess on a daily \nbasis.\n186 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY |  PART TWO \nprocessing all notes and thoughts relative to inter actions, projects, \nnew initiatives, and input that have come your way since your last \ndownload, and purging those not needed. \nPrevious Calendar Data Review past calendar dates in detail for \nremaining action items, reference information, and so on, and \ntransfer that data into the active system. Be able to archive your \nlast week's calendar with nothing left uncaptured. \nUpcoming Calendar Look at future calendar events (long- and \nshort-term). Capture actions about arrangements and  prepara- \ntions for any upcoming events. \nEmpty Your Head Put in writing (in appropriate categories) any \nnew projects, action items, waiting-fors, someday/m aybes, and so \nforth that you haven't yet captured. \nReview \"Projects\" (and Larger Outcome) Lists Evaluate the status \nof projects, goals, and outcomes one by one, ensuri ng that at least \none current kick-start action for each is in your s ystem. \nReview \"Next Actions\"Lists Mark off completed actions. Review \nfor reminders of further action steps to capture. \nReview \"Waiting For\" List Record appropriate actions for any \nneeded follow-up. Check off received items. \nReview Any Relevant Checklists Is there anything you haven't \ndone that you need to do? \nReview \"Someday/Maybe\" List Check for any projects that may \nhave become active and transfer them to \"Projects.\"  Delete items \nno longer of interest. \nCHAPTER 8  |  REVIEWING: KEEPING YOUR SYSTEM FUNCTIONAL \nReview \"Pending\" and Support Files Browse through all work- \nin-progress support material to trigger new actions , completions, \nand waiting-fors. \nBe Creative and Courageous Are there any new, wonderful, hare- \nbrained, creative, thought-provoking, risk-taking i deas you can \nadd to your system? \nThis review process is common sense, but few \nof us do it as well as we could, and that means as \nregularly as we should to keep a clear mind and a \nsense of relaxed control. \nThe Right Time and Place for the Review \nThe Weekly Review is so critical that it behooves y ou \nto establish good habits, environments, and tools t o \nsupport it. Once your comfort zone has been estab- \nlished for the kind of relaxed control that Getting \nThings Done is all about, you won't have to worry too \nmuch about making yourself do your review—you'll \nhave to to get back to your personal standards again. \nUntil then, do whatever you need to, once a \nweek, to trick yourself into backing away from the \ndaily grind for a couple of hours—not to zone out, \nbut to rise up at least to \"10,000 feet\" and catch up. \nIf you have the luxury of an office or work space \nthat can be somewhat isolated from the people and i nteractions of \nthe day, and if you have anything resembling a typi cal Monday- \nto-Friday workweek, I recommend that you block out two hours \nearly every Friday afternoon for the review. Three factors make \nthis an ideal time: \n• The events of the week are likely to be still fre sh enough for you \nto be able",

The more fortunate \nof them have a one-hour train commute. \nIf you recognize yourself in that picture, your gre atest chal- \nlenge will be to build in a consistent process of r egrouping, when \nyour world is not directly in your face. You'll nee d to either accept \nthe requirement of an after-hours time at your desk  on a Friday \nnight or establish a relaxed but at-work kind of lo cation and time \nat home. \nCHAPTER 8  I  REVIEWING: KEEPING YOUR SYSTEM FUNCTIONAL \nExecutive Operational Review Time I've coached many execu- \ntives to block out two hours on their calendars on Fridays. For \nthem the biggest problem is how to balance quality thinking and \ncatch-up time with the urgent demands of mission-cr itical inter- \nactions. This is a tough call. The most senior and savvy of them, \nhowever, know the value of sacrificing the seemingl y \nurgent for the truly important, and they create the ir \nislands of time for some version of this process. \nEven the executives who have integrated a con- \nsistent reflective time for their work, though, oft en \nseem to give short shrift to the more mundane revie w \nand catch-up process at the \"10,000-foot\" level. Be tween wall-to- \nwall meetings and ambling around your koi pond with  a chardon- \nnay at sunset, there's got to be a slightly elevate d level of reflection \nand regrouping required for operational control and\nfocus. If you think you have all your open loops fu lly \nidentified, clarified, assessed, and actionalized, you're \nprobably kidding yourself. \nThe \"Bigger Picture\" Reviews \nYes, at some point you must clarify the larger out-\ncomes, the long-term goals, the visions and princi-\nples that ultimately drive and test your decisions.\nWhat are your key goals and objectives in your \nwork? What should you have in place a year or three\nyears from now? How is your career going? Is this t he \nlife-style that is most fulfilling to you? Are you doing \nwhat you really want or need to do, from a deeper \nand longer-term perspective? \nThe explicit focus of this book is not at those \n",

If your meeting is \nstarting in ten minutes, you'll most likely select a different action \nto do right now than you would if the next couple o f hours were \nclear. \nObviously, it's good to know how much time you have  at \nhand (hence the emphasis on calendar and watch). A total-life \naction-reminder inventory will give you maximum inf ormation \nabout what you need to do, and make it much easier to match \nyour actions to the windows you have. In other word s, if you have \nten minutes before that next meeting, find a ten-mi nute thing to \ndo. If your lists have only the \"big\" or \"important \" things on them, \n193 \nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY I  PART TWO \nno item listed may be possible to handle in a ten-m inute period. If \nyou're going to have to do those shorter action thi ngs anyway, the \nmost productive way to get them done is to utilize the little \"weird \ntime\" windows that occur throughout the day. \nEnergy Available \nAlthough you can increase your energy level at time s \nby changing your context and redirecting your focus , \nyou can do only so much. The tail end of a day take n \nup mostly by a marathon budget-planning session is \nprobably not the best time to call a prospective cl ient \nor start drafting a performance-review policy. It \nmight be better to call the airline to change a res erva- \ntion, process some expense receipts, or skim a trad e \njournal. \nJust as having all your next-action options availab le allows \nyou to take advantage of various time slots, knowin g about every- \nthing you're going to need to process and do at som e point \nwill allow you to match productive activity with yo ur vitality \nlevel. \nI recommend that you always keep an inventory of th ings \nthat need to be done that require very little menta l or creative \nhorsepower.

It \nsprings from their experience of having more on the ir \nplate to do than they can comfortably handle. They \nknow that some hard choices have to be made, and \nthat some things may not get done at all. \nAt the end of the day, in order to feel good about \nwhat you didn't get done, you must have made some c onscious \ndecisions about your responsibilities, goals, and v alues. That \nprocess invariably includes an often complex interp lay with the \ngoals, values, and directions of your organization and of the other \nsignificant people in your life, and with the impor tance of those \nrelationships to you. \n195 It is impossible to \nfeel good about\nyour choices unless \nyou are clear about\nwhat your work \nreally is.\n196 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY |  PART TWO \nThe Threefold Model for \nEvaluating Daily Work \nSetting priorities assumes that some things will be  more important \nthan others, but important relative to what? In thi s context, the \nanswer is, to your work—that is, the job you have a ccepted from \nyourself and/or from others. This is where the next  two frameworks \nneed to be brought to bear in your thinking. They'r e about defining \nyour work. Keep in mind that though much of this me thodology \nwill be within the arena of your professional focus , I'm using \"work\" \nin the universal sense, to mean anything you have a  commitment to \nmaking happen, personally as well as professionally . \nThese days, daily work activity itself presents a r elatively new \ntype of challenge to most professionals, something that it's help- \nful to understand as we endeavor to build the most productive \nsystems. As I explained earlier, during the course of the workday, \nat any point in time, you'll be engaged in one of t hree types of \nactivities: \n• Doing predefined work \n• Doing work as it shows up \n• Defining your work \nYou may be doing things on your action lists, doing  things as \nthey come up, or processing incoming inputs to dete rmine what \nwork that needs to be done, either then or later, f rom your lists. \nThis is common sense. But many people let themselve s get \nwrapped around the second activity—dealing with thi ngs that \nshow up ad hoc—much too easily, and let the other t wo slide, to \ntheir detriment.",
