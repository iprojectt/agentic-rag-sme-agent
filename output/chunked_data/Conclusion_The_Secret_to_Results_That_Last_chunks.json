    "text": "TConclusion\nThe Secr et to R esults That Last\nHERE IS AN ancient Greek parable known as the Sorites\nParadox, * which talks about the eﬀect one small action\ncan have when repeated enough times. One formulation of\nthe paradox goes as follows: Can one coin make a person\nrich? If you give a person a pile of ten coins, you wouldn’t\nclaim that he or she is rich. But what if you add another?\nAnd another? And another? A t some point, you will have to\nadmit that no one can be rich unless one coin can make him\nor her so .\nWe can say the same about atomic habits. Can one tiny\nchange transform your life? It’s unlikely you would say so .\nBut what if you made another? And another? And another?\nAt some point, you will have to admit that your life was\ntransformed by one small change.\nThe holy grail of habit change is not a single 1 percent\nimprovement, but a thousand of them. It’s a bunch of\natomic habits stacking up, each one a fundamental unit of\nthe overall system.\nIn the beginning, small improvements can often seem\nmeaningless because they get washed away by the weight\nof the system. Just as one coin won’t make you rich, one\npositive change like meditating for one minute or reading\none page each day is unlikely to deliver a noticeable\ndiﬀerence.\nGradually , though, as you continue to layer small\nchanges on top of one another , the scales of life start to\nmove. Each improvement is like adding a grain of sand to\nthe positive side of the scale, slowly tilting things in your\nfavor . Eventually , if you stick with it, you hit a tipping point.\nSuddenly , it feels easier to stick with good habits. The\nweight of the system is working for you rather than against\nyou.\nOver the course of this book, we’ve looked at dozens of\nstories about top performers. W e’ve heard about Olympic\ngold medalists, award-winning artists, business leaders,\nlifesaving physicians, and star comedians who have all used\nthe science of small habits to master their craft and vault to\nthe top of their ﬁeld. Each of the people, teams, and\ncompanies we have covered has faced diﬀerent\ncircumstances, but ultimately progressed in the same way:\nthrough a commitment to tiny , sustainable, unrelenting\nimprovements.\nSuccess is not a goal to reach or a ﬁnish line to cross. It\nis a system to improve, an endless process to reﬁne. In\nChapter 1, I said, “If you’re having trouble changing your\nhabits, the problem isn’t you. The problem is your system.\nBad habits repeat themselves again and again not because\nyou don’t want to change, but because you have the wrong\nsystem for change.”\nAs this book draws to a close, I hope the opposite is true.\nWith the F our Laws of Behavior Change, you have a set of\ntools and strategies that you can use to build better\nsystems and shape better habits. Sometimes a habit will be\nhard to remember and you’ll need to make it obvious . Other\ntimes you won’t feel like starting and you’ll need to make it\nattractive . In many cases, you may ﬁnd that a habit will be\ntoo diﬀicult and you’ll need to make it easy . And\nsometimes, you won’t feel like sticking with it and you’ll\nneed to make it satisfying .\nBehaviors are eﬀortless\nhere.Behaviors are diﬀicult\nhere.\nObvious Invisible\nAttractive Unattractive\nEasy Hard\nSatisf ying Unsatisf ying\nYou want to push your good habits towar d the lef t side of the\nspectrum by making them obvious, attractive, easy, and\nsatisf ying. Meanwhile, you want to cluster your bad habits\ntowar d the right side by making them invisible, unattractive,\nhard, and unsatisf ying.\nThis is a continuous process. There is no ﬁnish line.\nThere is no permanent solution. Whenever you’re looking\nto improve, you can rotate through the F our Laws of\nBehavior Change until you ﬁnd the next bottleneck. Make it\nobvious. Make it attractive. Make it easy . Make it\nsatisfying.  Round and round. Always looking for the next\nway to get 1 percent better .\nThe secret to getting results that last is to never stop\nmaking improvements. It’s remarkable what you can build\nif you just don’t stop. It’s remarkable the business you can\nbuild if you don’t stop working. It’s remarkable the body\nyou can build if you don’t stop training.",
