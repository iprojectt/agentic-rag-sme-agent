Suppose that you are the director of marketin g for a major pharmaceutical firm.  You are about to \nbegin an average day at the office, and as you look over  the items to attend to that day, you estimate the \namount of time each one will take.    Your unprioritized list includes the following:    1.  You'd like to have lunch with the general manager (1-1 1/2 hours).    2.  You were instructed the day before to prepare  your media budget for th e following year (2 or 3 \ndays).    3.  Your \"IN\" basket is overflowing into your \"OUT\" basket (1-1 1/2 hours).    4.  You need to talk to the sales manager about last month's sales; his offi ce is down the hall (4 \nhours).    5.  You have several items of correspondence that your secretary says are urgent (1 hour).    6.  You'd like to catch up on the medical journals piled upon your desk (1/2 hour).    7.  You need to prepare a presentation for a sales meeting slated for next month  (2 hours). \n   8.  There's a rumor that the last batc h of product X didn't pass quality control. \n   9.  Someone from the FDA wants you to return his call about product X (1/2 hour).    10.  There is a meeting at 2 P.M. for the execut ive board, but you don't know what it is about (1 \nhour).    Take a few minutes now and use what you have learned from Habits 1, 2, and 3 that might help you \nto effectively schedule your day.    By asking you to plan only one day, I have automatically elimin ated the wider context of the week \nso fundamental to fourth generation time management.  But you will be able to see the power of Quadrant II, principle-centered paradigm even in the context of one nine-hour period of time \n   It is fairly obvious that most of the items on the list are Quadrant I activities.
