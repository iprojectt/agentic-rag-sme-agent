Dr. Mackenzie contends that when it comes to time, one can only \nmanage\noneself in relation to it.

It is therefore not for us to choose whether we spend or save\ntime but to choose only how we spend it.\nSoft Skills for Public Managers\n22  Misconceptions about Time\nThere are several misconceptions which we all have about time. They affect everyone\nincluding those persons who may be considered quite successful and effective. Here aresome of the misconceptions identified by Dr. Mackenzie:\n·Time management is simple - all it requires is common sense.\n While it is true\nthat the concept is simple, the self-discipline required to practice effective time\nmanagement is not easy.\n·Work is best performed under pressure.  Psychological studies show this to be\nno more than an excuse for procrastination. One does not work well under pressure\n- only does the best one can under the circumstances. Pressure and challenge\nmust not be confused. Lara’s performance when the West Indies Team is in trouble\nhas more to do with application and determination rather than pressure.\n·I use a diary, a to-do list and have a secretary to keep me organized.  One\nhas to keep oneself organized - no one can do it for others. The trouble with the\ndisorganized person is that he hardly has time to listen to his secretary or look at\nhis diary.\n·I do not have the time.  The effective worker or manager often gets more work\ndone in the earlier hours of the morning than most laggards get done in the whole\nday. He then no longer has to work against tight deadlines and under stress which\ncontributes to heart problems and not unusually the ultimate reduction of time on\nthis earth.\n·Time management might be good for some kinds of work but my job is\ncreative. Time management is not about routine: it is about self-discipline. Lack of\ndiscipline prevents one from being great instead of simply good.\n·Time management takes away the fun and freedom of spontaneity.   Is working\nunder stress, forgetting appointments, making constant excuses and apologies to\nbe fun? Would it not be much more fun if by better organization one had one or two\nmore hours every day to spend with the family, to play games, read a good book,\nplan for tomorrow and the day and week after or just relax?\nHandbook on Time Management Skills\n3• Management by crisis\n• Lack of Planning• Incomplete information• Personal disorganization• Attempting too much• Inability to Say   No• Responsibility unclear• Ineffective delegation• Inadequate staff & resources• Paperwork\n• Poor communication• Poorly organized meetings• Leaving tasks unfinished• Inadequate controls• Lack of self-discipline• Socializing• Drop-in visitors• Telephone interruptions",

Managers would do well to look for and reflect on whether they are subject to\nany of those symptoms with a view to take necessary corrective actions.\nThe following are some of the indicators of poor time management:\n·Constant rushing  (e.g. between meetings or tasks)\n·Frequent delays  (e.g. in attending meetings, meeting deadlines)\n·Low productivity, energy and motivation  (e.g. ‘I can’t seem to get worked up\nabout anything’)\n·Frustration  (e.g. ‘Oh, things just don’t move ahead)\n·Impatience  (e.g. ‘where the hell is that information I’ve asked him for?’)\n·Chronic vacillation between alternatives  (e.g. ‘whichever option I choose it is\ngoing to put me at a big disadvantage. I don’t know which way to jump’)\n·Difficulty setting and achieving goals  (e.g. ‘I’m not sure what is expected of me’)\nSoft Skills for Public Managers\n44  The Eleven Time Thieves\nDr. Donald E. Wetmore ( “Time Thieves: The 11 Biggest Time-wasters Revealed”) lists out\nthe eleven ‘inconsiderate troupe’ of eleven thieves that gang up to steal some of the precious\ntime away from productive use of managers.\n1. Poor Planning:  Failure to see the value of planning and getting impatient to get\nsomething done are the causes of poor planning. Absence of a plan of action is likely to\ntrigger off a false start, resulting in unproductive time utilization on the critical path of the\ntask being undertaken. Consequently, the managers might not find enough time forcompleting the task.\n2. Crisis Management:  Most often, crisis management is an offspring of lack of\nprioritization of tasks.  As a result of the inability to distinguish between the urgent, the\nimportant and the unnecessary tasks, unimportant tasks are likely to get done first at thecost of important tasks. Consequently, the managers are not likely to find enough time to\nget around to the important things.\n3. Procrastination:  It is easy to put off tasks if they are not due right away.  The trouble is,\ntasks pile up and can force managers to run into a time crunch later. Procrastination is\ngenerally triggered off by the fear of failure / success, perfectionism, wanting to do it all or\nincorrect priorities. It is a virtue to want to do a good job. But some people become soanxious about getting a job done perfectly that they never complete it.

Not Delegating : Wanting-to-do-all by oneself is yet another thief that could let the\nmanagers lose control. They feel that employees can never do anything as well as theycan. They fear that something will go wrong if someone else takes over a job. They lack\ntime for long-range planning because they are bogged down in day-to-day operations.\n6. Unnecessary Meetings:  If a meeting is held without a specific agenda and nothing\nproductive comes out of it, clearly that meeting was unnecessary. Obviously, such meetings\nare thieves as the time is wasted and things just do not get started.\n7. The “shuffling blues”:  Managers often waste much time because of disorganization.\nKeeping things that they need in a specific place, eliminating clutter, making sure that theyhave all the materials or information that they need before starting on the task and following\na day-planner or schedule will help keep the ‘shuffling blues’ away at the work place.\n8.

Negative People:  Being surrounded by negative people could mean the managers\nare spending a lot of their time listening to them but getting nothing much or purposeful\nfrom them.  Obviously, avoiding such people will help the managers to minimize wastedhours and get some of their productive time back.\nSoft Skills for Public Managers\n6How much time do your spend each day on the following time stealers?\n• Watching TV\n• Reading Newspapers / Magazines excessively\n• Idle chat, gossip and telephonic talk• Opening and sorting mail\n• Returning telephone calls\n• Meetings• Paying bills\n• Day-dreaming\n• Fretting over personal problems• Caught in traffic snarls\n• Planning how to change things\n• Waiting for things to happen• Taking naps\n• Eating snacks between meals\n• Drinking• Smoking\n• Shopping\n• Wagering money\nHandbook on Time Management Skills\n75  Saboteur Time Styles\nThe other aspect is self-inflicted thieves – ‘saboteur time styles’ that steal time. Based\non the typical patterns of behaviour that tend to sabotage people’s attempts at effectivetime management, Susan Ward (“Are You Sabotaging Your Time Management Efforts”)\nclassifies managers into different personality types and prescribes the following simple\nexercise, intended to help managers discover their standard behavioural responses\nto events and provide them with some clues for effective time management.\nThe Firemen  - For them, every event is a crisis. They are always seen busy dousing\nthe fires. They find scarcely any time for anything else and do not spare a thought on\ntime-management. Tasks keep piling up around them, while they are seen rushing\nfrom fire to fire all day.\nThe Over-Committers  – They just cannot say ‘No’ to anybody. They oblige and try to\nplease everybody. All that anyone has to do is just ask, and they will chair another\ncommittee, take on another project, or organize yet another community event.\nConsequently, none of the tasks receives complete attention and remains half-done.\nThe Aquarians  - There is such a thing as being too “laid-back” - especially when it\nstarts interfering with their ability to finish tasks or bother to return phone calls. Getting\nto things that is when they get to them is not time management; it is simple task\navoidance.\nThe Chatty Kathys  - Born to socialize, they have astounding oral communication\nskills and cannot resist exercising them at every opportunity. Every interaction becomesa long drawn out conversation - especially if there is an unpleasant task dawning that\nthey would like to put off.\nThe Perfectionists  – Exactitude is their watchword, and they feel that no rushed job\ncan be a good job. Finishing tasks to satisfaction is such a problem; they need more\ntime zones, not just more time.\nSoft Skills for Public Managers\n8Price of Time Inefficiency\nWhat is the price of inefficient time management for an organization? That is a crucial\nquestion managers should ask and promptly address. Statistics show that a person -on the average - loses at least one hour of productivity each day due to disorganization\nand inefficiency.  Accordingly calculated, the aggregate monetary value of loss caused\nby inefficient time management by all the employees in an organization amounts to:\n·1 hour  X  one person’s hourly salary = Rs. ____________\n·6 days a week X ____________ Rs. lost today = Rs. lost this week.\n·48 weeks X Rs lost this week + _________  ____ Rs. lost this year.\n·Number of persons X __ Rs. lost this year = Rs (total) __________\nThe Six D’s\n“When’s the last day you didn’t have a high-priority phone call, an urgent email or a\nstressed-out colleague begging for attention?” asks Tom Gegax, founder of GegaxManagement Systems and",
