Another card is pulled from the\nTo Do column.\nSelf-directing\nIn Agile Development, the team is responsible for planning, tracking, reporting and communicating in the\nproject. Team is allowed to make decisions and is accountable for the completion of the development and\nproduct quality. This is aligned to the characteristic of empowerment of the team in Kanban.\nContinuous Flow\nIn Agile development, there is no gate approach and the work flows across the different functions without\nwait-time.

Agile Kanban has a concept of iteration that is not present in Kanban. Further, no processes\nare considered.\nKanban in Value Stream\nKanban is defined to be executed in value stream with focus on delivery of value. Kanban in software\ndevelopment can be visualized as the features flowing across the value stream. All the Kanban\ncharacteristics  are met in the\nKanban approach for software development.\nFeature Kanban Board\nFeature Kanban Board is used to track the Feature Driven Development with Kanban Approach. Each\nFeature is assigned to a particular release. The columns in the Kanban board represent releases. Hence,\neach column contains all the features assigned to the release represented by it.\nEach feature is broken into stories. Each release is broken into iterations. The iteration is executed in an\nAgile Development approach. This can be treated as a sub-stream in the value stream, with the stories to be\ncompleted within that iteration assigned to it.\nAgile Kanban in Sub-stream\nAgile Kanban approach is followed within each sub-stream that is implemented as an iteration. Each story\nis broken into tasks in the iteration. Task Kanban board is used to track the status and progress of the story\ndevelopment tasks. The current status of each task is known by displaying the cards in separate columns on\nthe board. The columns are labeled as To Do, Doing, and Done. Each task moves from To Do to Doing and\nthen to Done.\nContinuous Delivery\nContinuous delivery to the customer is ensured with features tracked on feature Kanban board and stories\nrepresenting features tracked on task Kanban board.\nDelivery through a release is accomplished by −\nContinuous tracking\nConstant communication with the customer\nAdjusting development plan as required\nFocusing on delivery of value to the customer\nAgile development as well as Kanban maintain team collaboration. This, in turn helps in identifying and\nresolving Bottlenecks immediately as required by Kanban. This results in accomplishment of all the needed\ntasks within the iteration to deliver quality product, which meets customer expectations.\nContinuous Process Improvement\nKanban supports process improvements to enhance the delivery approach continuously.\nConsider a requirement that is a change or addition to the product. In such a case, Kanban cards can be",

These similarities\nand differences will help you in choosing the correct method for your project.\nKanban and Scrum - Similarities\nSimilarities between Kanban and Scrum are −\nBoth are Agile.\nBoth use pull scheduling.\nBoth limit WIP, Kanban at task level and Scrum at sprint level.\nBoth use transparency across the development.\nBoth focus on delivering releasable software early.\nBoth are based on self-organizing teams.\nBoth require breaking the work into pieces.\nIn both the methods, the release plan is continuously optimized based on empirical data \n.\nKanban and Scrum - Differences\nThe differences between Kanban and Scrum are as follows −\nS.No Scrum Kanban\n1 Scrum prescribes roles. In Kanban, roles are optional.\n2 Product backlog is to be prioritized. Prioritization is optional.\n3Sprints are to be time-boxed. You can choose\nthe length of the sprint, but once chosen, the\nsame length is to be maintained for all the\nsprints.Time-boxed iterations are optional.\n4 Scrum team needs to commit to a particular\namount of work for the sprint.Commitment is optional.\n5 Cross-functional teams are prescribed. Cross-functional teams are optional.\nSpecialist teams are allowed.\n6 Uses velocity as default metric for planning\nand process improvement.Uses lead time  as default metric\nfor planning and process improvement.\n7 Items such as stories, tests must be broken\ndown so that they can be completed within\none sprint.No particular item size is prescribed.\n8Sprint backlog shows what tasks are to be\nexecuted during the current sprint. These\ntasks are displayed on Scrum board.\nScope of the sprint is fixed. WIP is limited\nper unit of time .Tasks are defined at workflow level. WIP is\nlimited per workflow state.Scrum–Velocity,Kanban−LeadTime/CycleTime\ncycletime\nWIPlimitisthevelocity\n4/23/2019 Kanban Quick Guide\nhttps://www .tutorialspoint.com/cgi-bin/printpage.cgi 10/179 Additions/Changes cannot be done within a\nsprint.Additions /changes can be done if WIP limit\nis not crossed.\n10 New Scrum board is set at the beginning of\nevery sprint.Kanban board is persistent.\n11 Daily meetings need to be conducted. Daily meetings are optional.\n12 Burn-down charts are prescribed. No particular chart is prescribed.\nKanban vs. Scrum\nThe following advantages can help you choose between Kanban and Scrum −\nYou need to choose Kanban if you already have working processes and you want to improve without\ndisturbing the whole system whereas you need to choose Scrum if you want to introduce a new\nprocess in the organization.\nYou can use Kanban in the product development with Feature Driven Development to track the\nworkflows in the value stream whereas you can use Scrum for the development in each iteration.\nYou need to define the WIP Limits in Kanban explicitly whereas you need to define the sprint length\nin scrum that imposes WIP limits implicitly.\nBoth Kanban and Scrum are adaptive but Scrum is more prescriptive than Kanban.\nKanban imposes only two Rules: Visualize workflow and limit WIP whereas Scrum imposes more\nconstraints such as time-boxed Sprints.\nKanban leads to organizational process improvements, both in management and development.\nKanban also supports maintenance activities. Scrum leads to high throughput in small development\nteams. It does not contribute to product development and maintenance workflows that are longer in\nduration with unpredictability on the size of work units and changes. Scrum does not emphasize on\noptimizing management activities.\nIn Kanban, you can choose when to do planning, process improvement, and release. You can choose\nto do these activities on a regular basis or on-demand. Scrum iteration is",
