Most of the really important work you dorequires large chunks of unbroken time to complete. Your ability to\ncreate and carve out these blocks of high value, highly productive\ntime, is central to your ability to make a significant contribution toyour work and your life.\nSuccessful salespeople set aside a specific time period each day to\nphone prospects. Rather than procrastinating or delaying on a taskthat they don’t particularly like, they resolve that they will phone for\none solid hour between 10:00 and 11:00 AM. They then discipline\nthemselves to follow through on their resolutions.\nMany business executives set aside a specific time each day to call\ncustomers directly to get feedback, or to return phone calls, or answer\ncorrespondence.\nSome people allocate specific 30-60 minute time periods each day for\nexercise. Many people read in the great books 15 minutes each night\nbefore retiring. In this way, over time, they eventually read dozens of\nthe best books ever written.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 109Schedule Blocks of Time\nThe key to the success of this method of working in specific time\nsegments is for you to plan your day in advance and specificallyschedule a fixed time period for a particular activity or task.\nYou make work appointments with yourself and then discipline\nyourself to keep them. You set aside thirty, sixty and ninety minutetime segments that you use to work on and complete important tasks.\nMany highly productive people schedule specific activities in\npreplanned time slots all day long. These people build their worklives around accomplishing key tasks one at a time. As a result, they\nbecome more and more productive and eventually produce two\ntimes, three times and five times as much as the average person.\nUse a Time Planner\nA time planner, broken down by day, hour and minute, organized in\nadvance, can be one of the most powerful, personal productivity\ntools of all. It enables you to see where you can consolidate and\ncreate blocks of time for concentrated work.\nDuring this working time, you turn off the telephone, eliminate all\ndistractions and work non-stop. One of the best work habits of all is\nfor you to get up early and work at home in the morning for several\nhours. You can get three times as much work done at home without\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 110interruptions as you ever could in a busy office where you are\nsurrounded by people and bombarded by phone calls.\nMake Every Minute Count\nWhen you fly on business, you can create your office in the air by\nplanning your work thoroughly before you depart. When the plane\ntakes off, you can work non-stop for the entire flight. You will beamazed at how much work you can go through when you worksteadily in an airplane, without interruptions.\nOne of the keys to high levels of performance and productivity is for\nyou to make every minute count. Use travel and transition time, what\nis often called \"gifts of time\" to complete small chunks of larger tasks.\nRemember, the pyramids were built one block at a time. A great life\nand a great career is built one task, and often, one part of a task, at a\ntime. Your job in time management is to deliberately and creatively\norganize the concentrated time periods you need to get your key jobs\ndone well, and on schedule.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 111Eat That Frog!\n1.  Think continually of different ways that you can save, schedule\nand consolidate large chunks of time. Use this time to work on\nimportant tasks with the most significant long-term consequences.\n2.  Make every minute count. Work steadily and continuously\nwithout diversion or distraction by planning and preparing your\nwork in advance. Most of all, keep focused on the most important\nresults for which you are responsible.",
