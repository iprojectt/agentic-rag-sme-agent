Snakes can smell by “tasting the air” with\ntheir highly sensitive tongues. Sharks can detect small\namounts of electricity and vibrations in the water caused by\nnearby ﬁsh. Even bacteria have chemoreceptors—tiny\nsensory cells that allow them to detect toxic chemicals in\ntheir environment.\nIn humans, perception is directed by the sensory nervous\nsystem. W e perceive the world through sight, sound, smell,\ntouch, and taste. But we also have other ways of sensing\nstimuli. Some are conscious, but many are nonconscious.\nFor instance, you can “notice” when the temperature drops\nbefore a storm, or when the pain in your gut rises during a\nstomachache, or when you fall oﬀ balance while walking on\nrocky ground. Receptors in your body pick up on a wide\nrange of internal stimuli, such as the amount of salt in your\nblood or the need to drink when thirsty .\nThe most powerful of all human sensory abilities,\nhowever , is vision. The human body has about eleven\nmillion sensory receptors. Approximately ten million of\nthose are dedicated to sight. Some experts estimate that\nhalf of the brain’s resources are used on vision. Given that\nwe are more dependent on vision than on any other sense,\nit should come as no surprise that visual cues are the\ngreatest catalyst of our behavior . For this reason, a small\nchange in what you see can lead to a big shift in what you\ndo. As a result, you can imagine how important it is to live\nand work in environments that are ﬁlled with productive\ncues and devoid of unproductive ones.\nThankfully , there is good news in this respect.

In one suburb near Amsterdam,\nthey found that some homeowners used 30 percent less\nenergy than their neighbors—despite the homes being of\nsimilar size and getting electricity for the same price.\nIt turned out the houses in this neighborhood were\nnearly identical except for one feature: the location of the\nelectrical meter . Some had one in the basement. Others\nhad the electrical meter upstairs in the main hallway . As\nyou may guess, the homes with the meters located in the\nmain hallway used less electricity . When their energy use\nwas obvious and easy to track, people changed their\nbehavior .\nEvery habit is initiated by a cue, and we are more likely\nto notice cues that stand out. Unfortunately , the\nenvironments where we live and work often make it easy\nnot to do certain actions because there is no obvious cue to\ntrigger the behavior . It’s easy not to practice the guitar\nwhen it’s tucked away in the closet. It’s easy not to read a\nbook when the bookshelf is in the corner of the guest room.\nIt’s easy not to take your vitamins when they are out of\nsight in the pantry . When the cues that spark a habit are\nsubtle or hidden, they are easy to ignore.\nBy comparison, creating obvious visual cues can draw\nyour attention toward a desired habit. In the early 1990s,\nthe cleaning staﬀ at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam\ninstalled a small sticker that looked like a ﬂy near the\ncenter of each urinal. Apparently , when men stepped up to\nthe urinals, they aimed for what they thought was a bug.\nThe stickers improved their aim and signiﬁcantly reduced\n“spillage” around the urinals. Further analysis determined\nthat the stickers cut bathroom cleaning costs by 8 percent\nper year .\nI’ve experienced the power of obvious cues in my own\nlife. I used to buy apples from the store, put them in the\ncrisper in the bottom of the refrigerator , and forget all\nabout them. By the time I remembered, the apples would\nhave gone bad. I never saw them, so I never ate them.\nEventually , I took my own advice and redesigned my\nenvironment. I bought a large display bowl and placed it in\nthe middle of the kitchen counter . The next time I bought\napples, that was where they went—out in the open where I\ncould see them. Almost like magic, I began eating a few\napples each day simply because they were obvious rather\nthan out of sight.\nHere are a few ways you can redesign your environment\nand make the cues for your preferred habits more obvious:\nIf you want to remember to take your",

    "text": " eating a few\napples each day simply because they were obvious rather\nthan out of sight.\nHere are a few ways you can redesign your environment\nand make the cues for your preferred habits more obvious:\nIf you want to remember to take your medication each\nnight, put your pill bottle directly next to the faucet on\nthe bathroom counter .\nIf you want to practice guitar more frequently , place\nyour guitar stand in the middle of the living room.\nIf you want to remember to send more thank -you notes,\nkeep a stack of stationery on your desk.\nIf you want to drink more water , ﬁll up a few water\nbottles each morning and place them in common\nlocations around the house.\nIf you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make\nthe cue a big part of your environment. The most persistent\nbehaviors usually have multiple cues. Consider how many\ndiﬀerent ways a smoker could be prompted to pull out a\ncigarette: driving in the car , seeing a friend smoke, feeling\nstressed at work, and so on.\nThe same strategy can be employed for good habits. By\nsprinkling triggers throughout your surroundings, you\nincrease the odds that you’ll think about your habit\nthroughout the day . Make sure the best choice is the most\nobvious one. Making a better decision is easy and natural\nwhen the cues for good habits are right in front of you.\nEnvironment design is powerful not only because it\ninﬂuences how we engage with the world but also because\nwe rarely do it. Most people live in a world others have\ncreated for them. But you can alter the spaces where you\nlive and work to increase your exposure to positive cues\nand reduce your exposure to negative ones. Environment\ndesign allows you to take back control and become the\narchitect of your life. Be the designer of your world and not\nmerely the consumer of it.\nTHE CONTEXT IS THE CUE\nThe cues that trigger a habit can start out very speciﬁc, but\nover time your habits become associated not with a single\ntrigger but with the entire context  surrounding the\nbehavior .\nFor example, many people drink more in social situations\nthan they would ever drink alone. The trigger is rarely a\nsingle cue, but rather the whole situation: watching your\nfriends order drinks, hearing the music at the bar , seeing\nthe beers on tap.\nWe mentally assign our habits to the locations in which\nthey occur: the home, the oﬀice, the gym. Each location\ndevelops a connection to certain habits and routines. Y ou\nestablish a particular relationship with the objects on your\ndesk, the items on your kitchen counter , the things in your\nbedroom.\nOur behavior is not deﬁned by the objects in the\nenvironment but by our relationship to them. In fact, this is\na useful way to think about the inﬂuence of the\nenvironment on your behavior . Stop thinking about your\nenvironment as ﬁlled with objects. Start thinking about it\nas ﬁlled with relationships. Think in terms of how you\ninteract with the spaces around you. F or one person, her\ncouch is the place where she reads for an hour each night.\nFor someone else, the couch is where he watches television\nand eats a bowl of ice cream after work. Diﬀerent people\ncan have diﬀerent memories—and thus diﬀerent habits—\nassociated with the same place.\nThe good news?

It\ncan be diﬀicult to go to bed early if you watch television in\nyour bedroom each night. It can be hard to study in the\nliving room without getting distracted if that’s where you\nalways play video games. But when you step outside your\nnormal environment, you leave your behavioral biases\nbehind. You aren’t battling old environmental cues, which\nallows new habits to form without interruption.\nWant to think more creatively? Move to a bigger room, a\nrooftop patio, or a building with expansive architecture.\nTake a break from the space where you do your daily work,\nwhich is also linked to your current thought patterns.\nTrying to eat healthier? It is likely that you shop on\nautopilot at your regular supermarket. Try a new grocery\nstore. Y ou may ﬁnd it easier to avoid unhealthy food when\nyour brain doesn’t automatically know where it is located in\nthe store.\nWhen you can’t manage to get to an entirely new\nenvironment, redeﬁne or rearrange your current one.\nCreate a separate space for work, study , exercise,\nentertainment, and cooking. The mantra I ﬁnd useful is\n“One space, one use.”\nWhen I started my career as an entrepreneur , I would\noften work from my couch or at the kitchen table. In the\nevenings, I found it very diﬀicult to stop working. There\nwas no clear division between the end of work time and the\nbeginning of personal time. W as the kitchen table my oﬀice\nor the space where I ate meals? W as the couch where I\nrelaxed or where I sent emails? Everything happened in the\nsame place.\nA few years later , I could ﬁnally aﬀord to move to a home\nwith a separate room for my oﬀice. Suddenly , work was\nsomething that happened “in here” and personal life was\nsomething that happened “out there.” It was easier for me\nto turn oﬀ the professional side of my brain when there was\na clear dividing line between work life and home life. Each\nroom had one primary use. The kitchen was for cooking.\nThe oﬀice was for working.\nWhenever possible, avoid mixing the context of one habit\nwith another . When you start mixing contexts, you’ll start\nmixing habits—and the easier ones will usually win out.\nThis is one reason why the versatility of modern technology\nis both a strength and a weakness. Y ou can use your phone\nfor all sorts of tasks, which makes it a powerful device. But\nwhen you can use your phone to do nearly anything, it\nbecomes hard to associate it with one task. Y ou want to be\nproductive, but you’re also conditioned to browse social\nmedia, check email, and play video games whenever you\nopen your phone. It’s a mishmash of cues.\nYou may be thinking, “ You don’t understand. I live in\nNew Y ork City . My apartment is the size of a smartphone. I\nneed each room to play multiple roles.” F air enough. If your\nspace is limited, divide your room into activity zones: a\nchair for reading, a desk for writing, a table for eating. Y ou\ncan do the same with your digital spaces. I know a writer\nwho uses his computer only for writing, his tablet only for\nreading, and his phone only for social media and texting.\nEvery habit should have a home.\nIf you can manage to stick with this strategy , each\ncontext will become associated with a particular habit and\nmode of thought. Habits thrive under predictable\ncircumstances like these. F ocus comes automatically when\nyou are sitting at your work desk. Relaxation is easier when\nyou are in a space designed for that purpose. Sleep comes\nquickly when it is the only thing that happens in your\nbedroom. If you want behaviors that are stable and\npredictable, you need an environment that is stable and\npredictable.\nA stable environment where everything has a place and a\npurpose is an environment where habits can easily form.\nChapter Summary\nSmall changes in context can lead to large changes in\nbehavior over time.\nEvery habit is initiated by a cue. W e are more likely to\nnotice cues that stand out.\nMake the cues of good habits obvious in your\nenvironment.\nGradually , your habits become associated not with a\nsingle trigger but with the entire context surrounding\nthe behavior . The context becomes the cue.\nIt is easier to build new habits in a new environment\nbecause you are not ﬁghting against old cues.",
