Or like eating an elephant one bite at a\ntime.\nPsychologically, you will find it easier to do a single, small piece of a\nlarge project than to start on the whole job.\nOften, once you have started and completed a single part of the job,\nyou will feel like doing just one more \"slice.\"\nSoon, you will find yourself working through the job one part at a\ntime, and before you know it, the job will be completed.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 105Develop a Compulsion to Closure\nAn important point to remember is that you have deep within you an\n\"urge to completion\" or what is often referred to as a \"compulsion toclosure.\"\nThis means that you actually feel happier and more powerful when\nyou start and complete a task of any kind. You satisfy a deepsubconscious need to bring finality to a job or project. This sense ofcompletion or closure motivates you to start into the next task or\nproject and then to persist toward final completion. This act of\ncompletion triggers that release of endorphins in your brain that wetalked about earlier.\nAnd the bigger the task you start and complete, the better and more\nelated you feel. The bigger the frog you eat, the greater the surge ofpersonal power and energy you will experience.\nWhen you start and finish a small piece of a task, you feel motivated\nto start and finish another part, and then another, and so on. Each\nsmall step forward energizes you. You son develop an inner drive\nthat motivates you to carry through to completion. This completion\ngives you the great feeling of happiness and satisfaction that\naccompanies any success.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 106Swiss Cheese Your Tasks\nAnother technique you can use to get yourself going is called the\n\"Swiss cheese\" method of working. You use this technique to getyourself into gear by resolving to punch a hole into the task, like ahole in a block of Swiss Cheese.\nYou Swiss cheese  a task when you resolve to work for a specific time\nperiod on a task. This may be as little as five or ten minutes, after\nwhich you will stop and do something else. You will just take one\nbite of your frog and then rest, or do something else.\nThe power of this method is similar to the salami slice method. Once\nyou start working, you develop a sense of forward momentum and a\nfeeling of accomplishment. You become energized and enthusiastic.\nYou feel yourself internally motivated and propelled to keep goinguntil the task is complete.\nYou should try the \"Salami Slice\" or the \"Swiss cheese\" method on\nany task that seems overwhelming when you approach it for the first\ntime. You will be amazed at how helpful these techniques are in\novercoming procrastination.\nI have several friends who have become best selling authors by\nsimply resolving to write one page, or even one paragraph per day\nuntil the book was completed. And you can do the same.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 107Eat That Frog!\n1.   Put one of these techniques into action immediately. Take a large,\ncomplex, multi-task job that you’ve been putting off and either\n“salami slice” or “Swiss cheese” it to get started.\n2.  Become action-oriented. A common quality of high performance\nmen and women is that, when they hear a good idea, they take action\non it immediately. As a result, they learn more, faster, and get much\nbetter results.  Don’t delay. Try it today!",
