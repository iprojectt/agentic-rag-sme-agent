Learn, by constant practice,\nhow to husband your resources, and concentrate them,\nat any given moment, upon a given point.”\nJames Allen\nEat that frog! Every bit of planning, prioritizing and organizing\ncomes down to this simple concept.\nYour ability to select your most important task, to begin it and then to\nconcentrate on it single mindedly until it is complete is the key to\nhigh levels of performance and personal productivity.\nEvery great achievement of mankind has been preceded by a long\nperiod of hard, concentrated work until the job was done.\nOnce You Get Going, Keep Going\nSingle handling requires that once you begin, you keep working at\nthe task, without diversion or distraction, until the job is 100%\ncomplete. You keep urging yourself onward by repeating the words\n\"Back to work!\" over and over whenever you are tempted to stop or\ndo something else.\nBy concentrating single mindedly on your most important task, you\ncan reduce the time required to complete it by 50% or more.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 117It has been estimated that the tendency to start and stop a task, to\npick it up, put it down and come back to it can increase the time\nnecessary to complete the task by as much as 500%.\nEach time you return to the task, you have to familiarize yourself\nwith where you were when you stopped and what you still have to\ndo. You have to overcome inertia and get yourself going again. You\nhave to develop momentum and get into a productive work rhythm.\nBut when you prepare thoroughly and then begin, refusing to stop or\nturn aside until the job is done, you develop energy, enthusiasm andmotivation. You get better and better and more productive. You workfaster and more effectively.\nDon’t Waste Time\nThe truth is that once you have decided on your number one task,\nanything else that you do other than that is a relative waste of time.\nAny other activity is just not as valuable or as important as this job,\nbased on your own priorities.\nThe more you discipline yourself to working non-stop on a single\ntask, the more you move down the \"Efficiency Curve.\" You get moreand more high quality work done in less and less time.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 118Each time you stop working however, you break this cycle and move\nback up the curve to where every part of the task is more difficult\nand time consuming.\nSelf Discipline Is the Key\nElbert Hubbard defined self discipline as, \"The ability to make\nyourself do what you should do, when you should do it, whether youfeel like it or not.\"\nIn the final analysis, success in any area requires tons of discipline.\nSelf-discipline, self-mastery and self-control are the basic buildingblocks of character and high performance.\nStarting a high priority task and persisting with that task until it is\n100% complete is the true test of your character, your willpower andyour resolve.\nPersistence is actually self-discipline in action. The good news is that\nthe more you discipline yourself to persist on a major task, the more\nyou like and respect yourself, and the higher is your self-esteem.\nAnd the more you like and respect yourself, the easier it is for you to\ndiscipline yourself to persist even more.\nBy focusing clearly on your most valuable task and concentrating\nsingle mindedly until it is 100% complete, you actually shape and\nmold your own character. You become a superior person.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 119You feel stronger, more competent, confident and happier. You feel\nmore powerful and productive.\nYou eventually feel capable of setting and achieving any goal. You\nbecome the master of your own destiny. You place yourself on anascending spiral of personal effectiveness on which your future is\nabsolutely guaranteed.\nAnd the key to all of this is for you to determine the most valuable\nand important thing you could possibly do at every single moment\nand then, \"Eat That Frog!\"\nEat That Frog!\n1.  Take action! Resolve today to select the most important task or\nproject that you could complete and then launch into it immediately.\n2.  Once you start your most important task, discipline yourself to\npersevere without diversion or distraction until it is 100% complete.\nSee it as a “test” to determine whether you are the kind of person\nwho can make a decision to complete something and then carry it\nout.
