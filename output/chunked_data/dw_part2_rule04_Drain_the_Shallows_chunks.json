    "text": "Rule #4\nDrain the Shallows\nIn the summer of 2007, the software \ncompany 37signals (now called \nBasecamp) launched an experiment: \nThey shortened their workweek from \nfive days to four. Their employees \nseemed to accomplish the same amount \nof work with one less day, so they made \nthis change permanent: Every year, from\n\nMay through October, 37signals \nemployees work only Monday to \nThursday (with the exception of \ncustomer support, which still operates \nthe full week). As company cofounder \nJason Fried quipped in a blog post about \nthe decision: “People should enjoy the \nweather in the summer.”\nIt didn’t take long before the \ngrumbles began in the business press. A \nfew months after Fried announced his \ncompany’s decision to make four-day \nweeks permanent, journalist Tara Weiss \nwrote a critical piece for Forbes  titled \n“Why a Four-Day Work Week Doesn’t \nWork.” She summarized her problem \nwith this strategy as follows:\n\nPacking 40 hours into four days  \nisn ’ t necessarily an efficient way  \nto work. Many people fin d  that  \neight hours are tough enough;  \nrequiring them to stay fo r an  \nextra two could cause morale  \nand productivity to decrease.\nFried was quick to respond. In a blog \npost titled “Forbes Misses the Point of \nthe 4-Day Work Week,” he begins by \nagreeing with Weiss’s premise that it \nwould  be stressful for employees to \ncram forty hours of effort into four days. \nBut, as he clarifies, that’s not what he’s \nsuggesting. “The point of the 4-day work \nweek is about doing less work ,” he\n\nwrites. “It’s not about four 10-hour \ndays... it’s about four normalish 8-hour \ndays.”\nThis might seem confusing at first. \nFried earlier claimed that his employees \nget just as much done in four days as in \nfive days. Now, however, he’s claiming \nthat his employees are working fewer \nhours. How can both be true? The \ndifference, it turns out, concerns the role \nof shallow work. As Fried expands:\nVery few  people work even 8  \nhours a day. You ’ re lucky if you  \nget a few  good hours in between  \nall the meetings, interruptions,  \nweb surfing, office politics, and\n\npersonal business that permeate  \nthe typical workday.\nFewer official working hours  \nhelps squeeze the fa t out o f the  \ntypical workweek. Once  \neveryone has less time to get  \ntheir stuff done, they respect that  \ntime even more. People become  \nstingy with their time and that’ s  \na good thing. They don’ t waste it  \non things that just don’ t matter.  \nWhen you have fewer hours you  \nusually spend them more wisely.\nIn other words, the reduction in the \n37signals workweek disproportionately \neliminated shallow as compared to deep\n\nwork, and because the latter was left \nlargely untouched, the important stuff \ncontinued to get done. The shallow stuff \nthat can seem so urgent in the moment \nturned out to be unexpectedly \ndispensable.\nA natural reaction to this experiment \nis to wonder what would happen if \n37signals had gone one step further. If \neliminating hours of shallow work had \nlittle impact on the results produced, \nwhat would happen if they not only \neliminated shallow work, but then \nreplaced this newly recovered time with \nmore deep work? Fortunately for our \ncuriosity, the company soon put this \nbolder idea to the test as well.\n\nFried had always been interested in \nthe policies of technology companies \nlike Google that gave their employees 20 \npercent of their time to work on self- \ndirected projects. While he liked this \nidea, he felt that carving one day out of \nan otherwise busy week was not enough \nto support the type of unbroken deep \nwork that generates true breakthroughs. \n“I’d take 5 days in a row over 5 days \nspread out over 5 weeks,” he explained. \n“So our theory is that we’ll see better \nresults when people have a long stretch \nof uninterrupted time.”\nTo test this theory, 37signals \nimplemented something radical: The \ncompany gave its employees the entire\n\nmonth o f June  off to work deeply on \ntheir own projects. This month would be \na period free of any shallow work \nobligations—no status meetings, no \nmemos, and, blessedly, no PowerPoint. \nAt the end of the month, the company \nheld a “pitch day” in which employees \npitched the ideas they’d been working \non.

The Broadcasters’  \nAudience Research Board (the British \nequivalent of the American Nielsen \nCompany) places meters in a \nrepresentative sample of households.\n\nThese meters record, without bias or \nwishful thinking, exactly how much \npeople actually  watch.

In a Wall Street  \nJournal  article on the topic, business \nwriter Laura Vanderkam pointed out \nseveral more such examples. A survey \nby the National Sleep Foundation \nrevealed that Americans think they’re \nsleeping, on average, somewhere around\n\nseven hours a night. The American Time \nUse Survey, which has people actually \nmeasure their sleep, corrected this \nnumber to 8.6 hours. Another study \nfound that people who claimed to work \nsixty to sixty-four hours per week were \nactually averaging more like forty-four \nhours per week, while those claiming to \nwork more than seventy-five hours were \nactually working less than fifty-five.\nThese examples underscore an \nimportant point: We spend much of our \nday on autopilot—not giving much \nthought to what we’re doing with our \ntime. This is a problem.

This means, for example, that \ninstead of having a unique small box for \neach small task on your plate for the day \n— respond to boss  S  e-mail, submit  \nreimbursement form, ask Carl about  \nreport —you can batch similar things \ninto more generic task blocks.  You might \nfind it useful, in this case, to draw a line \nfrom a task block to the open right-hand \nside of the page where you can list out \nthe full set of small tasks you plan to \naccomplish in that block.\nWhen you’re done scheduling your \nday, every minute should be part of a \nblock. You have, in effect, given every \nminute of your workday a job. Now as \nyou go through your day, use this\n\nschedule to guide you.\nIt’s here, of course, that most people \nwill begin to run into trouble. Two things \ncan (and likely will) go wrong with your \nschedule once the day progresses. The \nfirst is that your estimates will prove \nwrong. You might put aside two hours \nfor writing a press release, for example, \nand in reality it takes two and a half \nhours. The second problem is that you’ll \nbe interrupted and new obligations will \nunexpectedly appear on your plate. \nThese events will also break your \nschedule.\nThis is okay. If your schedule is \ndisrupted, you should, at the next \navailable moment, take a few minutes to\n\ncreate a revised schedule for the time \nthat remains in the day. You can turn to a \nnew page. You can erase and redraw \nblocks. Or do as I do: Cross out the \nblocks for the remainder of the day and \ncreate new blocks to the right of the old \nones on the page (I draw my blocks \nskinny so I have room for several \nrevisions). On some days, you might \nrewrite your schedule half a dozen \ntimes. Don’t despair if this happens. \nYour goal is not to stick to a given \nschedule at all costs; it’s instead to \nmaintain, at all times, a thoughtful say in \nwhat you’re doing with your time going \nforward—even if these decisions are \nreworked again and again as the day\n\nunfolds.\nIf you find that schedule revisions \nbecome overwhelming in their \nfrequency, there are a few tactics that \ncan inject some more stability. First, you \nshould recognize that almost definitely  \nyou’re going to underestimate at first \nhow much time you require for most \nthings. When people are new to this \nhabit, they tend to use their schedule as \nan incarnation of wishful thinking—a \nbest-case scenario for their day. Over \ntime, you should make an effort to \naccurately (if not somewhat \nconservatively) predict the time tasks \nwill require.\nThe second tactic that helps is the use\n\nof overflow conditional  blocks. If \nyou’re not sure how long a given activity \nmight take, block off the expected time, \nthen follow this with an additional block \nthat has a split purpose. If you need more \ntime for the preceding activity, use this \nadditional block to keep working on it. If \nyou finish the activity on time, however, \nhave an alternate use already assigned \nfor the extra block (for example, some \nnonurgent tasks). This allows \nunpredictability in your day without \nrequiring you to keep changing your \nschedule on paper. For example, \nreturning to our press release example, \nyou might schedule two hours for writing \nthe press release, but then follow it by\n\nan additional hour block that you can use \nto keep writing the release, if needed, \nbut otherwise assign to catching up with \ne-mail.\nThe third tactic I suggest is to be \nliberal with your use of task blocks. \nDeploy many throughout your day and \nmake them longer than required to \nhandle the tasks you plan in the morning. \nLots of things come up during the typical \nknowledge worker’s day: Having\nregularly occurring blocks of time to \naddress these surprises keeps things \nrunning smoothly.\nBefore leaving you to put this strategy in \npractice, I should address a common\n\nobjection. In my experience pitching the \nvalues of daily schedules, I’ve found that \nmany people worry that this level of \nplanning will become burdensomely \nrestrictive. Here, for example, is part of \na comment from a reader named Joseph \non a blog post I wrote on this topic:\nI  think you fa r understate the  \nrole o f uncertainty... I  [worry  \nabout] readers applying these  \nobservations too seriously, to the  \npoint o f an obsessive (and  \nunhealthy) relationship with  \none s schedule that seems to  \nexaggerate the importance o f  \nminute-count",

In my own daily \nscheduling discipline, in addition to \nregularly scheduling significant blocks \nof time for speculative thinking and \ndiscussion, I maintain a rule that if I \nstumble onto an important insight, then \nthis is a perfectly valid reason to ignore \nthe rest of my schedule for the day (with \nthe exception, of course, of things that\n\ncannot be skipped). I can then stick with \nthis unexpected insight until it loses \nsteam At this point, I’ll step back and \nrebuild my schedule for any time that \nremains in the day.\nIn other words, I not only allow \nspontaneity in my schedule; I encourage \nit. Joseph’s critique is driven by the \nmistaken idea that the goal of a schedule \nis to force your behavior into a rigid \nplan. This type of scheduling, however, \nisn’t about constraint—it’s instead about \nthoughtfulness. It’s a simple habit that \nforces you to continually take a moment \nthroughout your day and ask: “What \nmakes sense for me to do with the time \nthat remains?” It’s the habit of asking\n\nthat returns results, not your unyielding \nfidelity to the answer.\nI would go so far as to argue that \nsomeone following this combination of \ncomprehensive scheduling and a \nwillingness to adapt or modify the plan \nas needed will likely experience more  \ncreative insights than someone who \nadopts a more traditionally \n“spontaneous” approach where the day \nis left open and unstructured. Without \nstructure, it’s easy to allow your time to \ndevolve into the shallow— e-mail, \nsocial media, Web surfing. This type of \nshallow behavior, though satisfying in \nthe moment, is not conducive to \ncreativity. With structure, on the other\n\nhand, you can ensure that you regularly \nschedule blocks to grapple with a new \nidea, or work deeply on something \nchallenging, or brainstorm for a fixed \nperiod—the type of commitment more \nlikely to instigate innovation.

The first two \ndescribe tasks that can be quite \ndemanding, and the final example seems \nimportant to advance a key work \nobjective. The purpose of this strategy is \nto give you an accurate metric for \nresolving such ambiguity—providing \nyou with a way to make clear and \nconsistent decisions about where given\n\nwork tasks fall on the shallow-to-deep \nscale. To do so, it asks that you evaluate \nactivities by asking a simple (but \nsurprisingly illuminating) question:\nHow long would it take (in months) \nto train a smart recent college \ngraduate with no specialized \ntraining in my field to complete this \ntask?\nTo illustrate this approach, let’s \napply this question to our examples of \nambiguous tasks.\n• Analyzing Example #1 :  To\nproperly edit an academic paper\n\nrequires that you understand the nuances \nof the work (so you can make sure it’s \nbeing described precisely) and the \nnuances of the broader literature (so you \ncan make sure it’s being cited properly). \nThese requirements require cutting-edge \nknowledge of an academic field— a task \nthat in the age of specialization takes \nyears of diligent study at the graduate \nlevel and beyond. When it comes to this \nexample, the answer to our question \nwould therefore be quite large, perhaps \non the scale of fifty to seventy-five \nmonths.\nAnalyzing Example #2 :  The\n\nsecond example doesn’t fare so well by \nthis analysis. To create a PowerPoint \npresentation that describes your \nquarterly sales requires three things: \nfirst, knowledge of how to make a \nPowerPoint presentation; second, an \nunderstanding of the standard format of \nthese quarterly performance \npresentations within your organization; \nand third, an understanding of what sales \nmetrics your organization tracks and \nhow to convert them into the right \ngraphs. The hypothetical college \ngraduate imagined by our question, we \ncan assume, would already know how to \nuse PowerPoint, and learning the\n\nstandard format for your organization’s \npresentations shouldn’t require more \nthan a week. The real question, \ntherefore, is how long it takes a bright \ncollege graduate to understand the \nmetrics you track, where to find the \nresults, and how to clean those up and \ntranslate them into graphs and charts that \nare appropriate for a slide presentation. \nThis isn’t a trivial task, but for a bright \ncollege grad it wouldn’t require more \nthan an additional month or so of training \n— so we can use two months as our \nconservative answer.\nAnalyzing Example #3 :  Meetings\n\ncan be tricky to analyze. They can seem \ntedious at times but they’re often also \npresented as playing a key role in your \norganization’s most important activities. \nThe method presented here helps cut \nthrough this veneer. How long would it \ntake to train a bright recent college \ngraduate to take your place in a planning \nmeeting? He or she would have to \nunderstand the project well enough to \nknow its milestones and the skills of its \nparticipants.

On the other hand, a task \nthat our hypothetical college graduate\n\ncan pick up quickly is one that does not \nleverage expertise, and therefore it can \nbe understood as shallow.\nWhat should you do with this \nstrategy? Once you know where your \nactivities fall on the deep-to-shallow \nscale, bias your time toward the former. \nWhen we reconsider our case studies, \nfor example, we see that the first task is \nsomething that you would want to \nprioritize as a good use of time, while \nthe second and third are activities of a \ntype that should be minimized—they \nmight feel productive, but their return on \n(time) investment is measly.\nOf course, how one biases away \nfrom shallow and toward depth is not\n\nalways obvious—even after you know \nhow to accurately label your \ncommitments. This brings us to the \nstrategies that follow, which will \nprovide specific guidance on how to \naccomplish this tricky goal.\nAsk Your Boss for a Shallow \nWork Budget\nHere’s an important question that’s \nrarely asked: What percentage o f my  \ntime should be spent on shallow work?  \nThis strategy suggests that you ask it. If \nyou have a boss, in other words, have a \nconversation about this question. (You’ll\n\nprobably have to first define for him or \nher what “shallow” and “deep” work \nmeans.) If you work for yourself, ask \nyourself  this question. In both cases, \nsettle on a specific answer. Then—and \nthis is the important part—try to stick to \nthis budget. (The strategies that precede \nand follow this one will help you \nachieve this goal.)\nFor most people in most non-entry- \nlevel knowledge work jobs, the answer \nto the question will be somewhere in the \n30 to 50 percent range (there’s a \npsychological distaste surrounding the \nidea of spending the majority  of your \ntime on unskilled tasks, so 50 percent is \na natural upper limit, while at the same\n\ntime most bosses will begin to worry \nthat if this percentage gets too much \nlower than 30 percent you’ll be reduced \nto a knowledge work hermit who thinks \nbig thoughts but never responds to e­\nmails).\nObeying this budget will likely \nrequire changes to your behavior. You’ll \nalmost certainly end up forced into \nsaying no to projects that seem infused \nwith shallowness while also more \naggressively reducing the amount of \nshallowness in your existing projects. \nThis budget might lead you to drop the \nneed for a weekly status meeting in \npreference for results-driven reporting \n(“let me know when you’ve made\n\nsignificant progress; then we’ll talk”). It \nmight also lead you to start spending \nmore mornings in communication \nisolation or decide it’s not as important \nas you once thought to respond quickly \nand in detail to every cc’d e-mail that \ncrosses your inbox.\nThese changes are all positive for \nyour quest to make deep work central to \nyour working life. On the one hand, they \ndon’t ask you to abandon your core \nshallow obligations—a move that would \ncause problems and resentment—as \nyou’re still spending a lot of time on \nsuch efforts. On the other hand, they do \nforce you to place a hard limit on the \namount of less urgent obligations you\n\nallow to slip insidiously into your \nschedule. This limit frees up space for \nsignificant amounts of deep effort on a \nconsistent basis.\nThe reason why these decisions \nshould start with a conversation with \nyour boss is that this agreement \nestablishes implicit support from your \nworkplace. If you work for someone \nelse, this strategy provides cover when \nyou turn down an obligation or \nrestructure a project to minimize \nshallowness. You can justify the move \nbecause it’s necessary for you to hit your \nprescribed target mix of work types. As \nI discussed in Chapter 2, part of the \nreason shallow work persists in large\n\nquantities in knowledge work is that we \nrarely see the total impact of such efforts \non our schedules.

Because, of course, \nin the end, a business’s goal is to \ngenerate value, not to make sure its \nemployees’  lives are as easy as \npossible.\nIf you work for yourself, this \nexercise will force you to confront the \nreality of how little time in your “busy” \nschedule you’re actually producing \nvalue. These hard numbers will provide \nyou the confidence needed to start\n\nscaling back on the shallow activities \nthat are sapping your time. Without these \nnumbers, it’s difficult for an \nentrepreneur to say no to any opportunity \nthat might  generate some positive return. \n“I have to be on Twitter!,” “I have to \nmaintain an active Facebook presence!,” \n“I have to tweak the widgets on my \nblog!,” you tell yourself, because when \nconsidered in isolation, to say no to any \none of these activities seems like you’re \nbeing lazy. By instead picking and \nsticking with a shallow-to-deep ratio, \nyou can replace this guilt-driven \nunconditional acceptance with the more \nhealthy habit of trying to get the most out \nof the time you put aside for shallow\n\nwork (therefore still exposing yourself \nto many opportunities), but keeping these \nefforts constrained to a small enough \nfraction of your time and attention to \nenable the deep work that ultimately \ndrives your business forward.\nOf course, there’s always the \npossibility that when you ask this \nquestion the answer is stark. No boss \nwill explicitly answer, “One hundred \npercent of your time should be shallow!” \n(unless you’re entry level, at which point \nyou need to delay this exercise until \nyou’ve built enough skills to add deep \nefforts to your official work \nresponsibilities), but a boss might reply, \nin so many words, “as much shallow\n\nwork as is needed for you to promptly \ndo whatever we need from you at the \nmoment.” In this case, the answer is still \nuseful, as it tells you that this isn’t a job \nthat supports deep work, and a job that \ndoesn’t support deep work is not a job \nthat can help you succeed in our current \ninformation economy. You should, in this \ncase, thank the boss for the feedback, \nand then promptly start planning how \nyou can transition into a new position \nthat values depth.\nFinish Your Work by Five \nThirty\n\nIn the seven days preceding my first \nwriting these words, I participated in \nsixty-five different e-mail conversations. \nAmong these sixty-five conversations, I \nsent exactly five e-mails after five thirty \np.m The immediate story told by these \nstatistics is that, with few exceptions, I \ndon’t send e-mails after five thirty. But \ngiven how intertwined e-mail has \nbecome with work in general, there’s a \nmore surprising reality hinted by this \nbehavior: I don’t work  after five thirty \np.m.\nI call this commitment fixed-  \nschedule productivity,  as I fix the firm \ngoal of not working past a certain time, \nthen work backward to find productivity\n\nstrategies that allow me to satisfy this \ndeclaration. I’ve practiced fixed- \nschedule productivity happily for more \nthan half a decade now, and it’s been \ncrucial to my efforts to build a \nproductive professional life centered on \ndeep work. In the pages ahead, I will try \nto convince you to adopt this strategy as \nwell.\nLet me start my pitch for fixed-schedule \nproductivity by first noting that, \naccording to conventional wisdom, in \nthe academic world I inhabit this tactic \nshould fail. Professors— especially \njunior professors— are notorious for \nadopting grueling schedules that extend\n\ninto the night and through weekends. \nConsider, for example, a blog post \npublished by a young computer science \nprofessor whom I’ll call “Tom.” In this \npost, which Tom wrote in the winter of \n2014, he replicates his schedule for a \nrecent day in which he spent twelve \nhours at his office. This schedule \nincludes five different meetings and \nthree hours of “administrative” tasks, \nwhich he describes as “tending to \nbushels of e-mails, filling out \nbureaucratic forms, organizing meeting \nnotes, planning future",

Even though I don’t \nwork at night and rarely work on \nweekends, between arriving at \nGeorgetown in the fall of 2011 and \nbeginning work on this chapter in the fall \nof 2014, I’ve published somewhere \naround twenty peer-reviewed articles. I \nalso won two competitive grants,\n\npublished one (nonacademic) book, and \nhave almost finished writing another \n(which you’re reading at the moment). \nAll while avoiding the grueling \nschedules deemed necessary by the \nToms of the world.\nWhat explains this paradox? We can \nfind a compelling answer in a widely \ndisseminated article published in 2013 \nby an academic further along in her \ncareer, and far more accomplished than \nI: Radhika Nagpal, the Fred Kavli \nProfessor of Computer Science at \nHarvard University. Nagpal opens the \narticle by claiming that much of the \nstress suffered by tenure-track \nprofessors is self-imposed. “Scary\n\nmyths and scary data abound about life \nas a tenure-track faculty at an ‘R1’  \n[research-focused] university,” she \nbegins, before continuing to explain how \nshe finally decided to disregard the \nconventional wisdom and instead \n“deliberately... do specific things to \npreserve my happiness.” This deliberate \neffort led Nagpal to enjoy her pre-tenure \ntime “tremendously.”\nNagpal goes on to detail several \nexamples of these efforts, but there’s one \ntactic in particular that should sound \nfamiliar. As Nagpal admits, early in her \nacademic career she found herself trying \nto cram work into every free hour \nbetween seven a.m. and midnight\n\n(because she has kids, this time, \nespecially in the evening, was often \nseverely fractured). It didn’t take long \nbefore she decided this strategy was \nunsustainable, so she set a limit of fifty \nhours a week and worked backward to \ndetermine what rules and habits were \nneeded to satisfy this constraint. Nagpal, \nin other words, deployed fixed-schedule \nproductivity.\nWe know this strategy didn’t hurt her \nacademic career, as she ended up \nearning tenure on schedule and then \njumping to the full professor level af ter \nonly three additional years (an \nimpressive ascent). How did she pull \nthis off? According to her article, one of\n\nthe main techniques for respecting her \nhour limit was to set drastic quotas on \nthe major sources of shallow  endeavors \nin her academic life. For example, she \ndecided she would travel only five times \nper year for any purpose, as trips can \ngenerate a surprisingly large load of \nurgent shallow obligations (from making \nlodging arrangements to writing talks). \nFive trips a year may still sound like a \nlot, but for an academic it’s light. To \nemphasize this point, note that Matt \nWelsh, a former colleague of Nagpal in \nthe Harvard computer science \ndepartment (he now works for Google) \nonce wrote a blog post in which he \nclaimed it was typical for junior faculty\n\nto travel twelve to twenty-four times a \nyear. (Imagine the shallow efforts \nNagpal avoided in sidestepping an extra \nten to fifteen trips!) The travel quota is \njust one of several tactics that Nagpal \nused to control her workday (she also, \nfor example, placed limits on the number \no f papers she would review per year), \nbut what all her tactics shared was a \ncommitment to ruthlessly capping the \nshallow while protecting the deep \nefforts—that is, original research—that \nultimately determined her professional \nfate.\nReturning to my own example, it’s a \nsimilar commitment that enables me to \nsucceed with fixed scheduling. I, too, am\n\nincredibly cautious about my use of the \nmost dangerous word in one’s \nproductivity vocabulary: “yes.” It takes \na lot to convince me to agree to \nsomething that yields shallow work.

If \nyou ask for my involvement in university \nbusiness that’s not absolutely necessary, \nI might respond with a defense I learned \nfrom the department chair who hired me: \n“Talk to me after tenure.” Another tactic \nthat works well for me is to be clear in \nmy refusal but ambiguous in my \nexplanation for the refusal. The key is to \navoid providing enough specificity about \nthe excuse that the requester has the \nopportunity to defuse it. If, for example, \nI turn down a time-consuming speaking\n\ninvitation with the excuse that I have \nother trips scheduled for around the \nsame time, I don’t provide details— \nwhich might leave the requester the \nability to suggest a way to fit his or her \nevent into my existing obligations—but \ninstead just say, “Sounds interesting, but \nI can’t make it due to schedule \nconflicts.” In turning down obligations, I \nalso resist the urge to offer a consolation \nprize that ends up devouring almost as \nmuch of my schedule (e.g., “Sorry I can’t \njoin your committee, but I’m happy to \ntake a look at some of your proposals as \nthey come together and offer my \nthoughts”). A clean break is best.\nIn addition to carefully guarding my\n\nobligations, I’m incredibly conscientious \nabout managing my time. Because my \ntime is limited each day, I cannot afford \nto allow a large deadline to creep up on \nme, or a morning to be wasted on \nsomething trivial, because I didn’t take a \nmoment to craft a smart plan. The \nDamoclean cap on the workday enforced \nby fixed-schedule productivity has a \nway of keeping my organization efforts \nsharp. Without this looming cutoff, I’d \nlikely end up more lax in my habits.\nTo summarize these observations, \nNagpal and I can both succeed in \nacademia without Tom-style overload \ndue to two reasons. First, we’re \nasymmetric in the culling forced by our\n\nfixed-schedule commitment. By \nruthlessly reducing the shallow while \npreserving the deep, this strategy frees \nup our time without diminishing the \namount of new value we generate. \nIndeed, I would go so far as to argue that \nthe reduction in shallow frees up more  \nenergy for the deep alternative, allowing \nus to produce more than if we had \ndefaulted to a more typical crowded \nschedule. Second, the limits to our time \nnecessitate more careful thinking about \nour organizational habits, also leading to \nmore value produced as compared to \nlonger but less organized schedules.\nThe key claim of this strategy is that \nthese same benefits hold for most\n\nknowledge work fields. That is, even if \nyou’re not a professor, fixed-schedule \nproductivity can yield powerful benefits. \nIn most knowledge work jobs, it can be \ndifficult in the moment to turn down a \nshallow commitment that seems \nharmless in isolation—be it accepting an \ninvitation to get coffee or agreeing to \n“jump on a call.” A commitment to \nfixed-schedule productivity, however, \nshifts you into a scarcity mind-set. \nSuddenly any obligation beyond your \ndeepest efforts is suspect and seen as \npotentially disruptive. Your default \nanswer becomes no, the bar for gaining \naccess to your time and attention rises \nprecipitously, and you begin to organize\n\nthe efforts that pass these obstacles with \na ruthless efficiency. It might also lead \nyou to test assumptions about your \ncompany’s work culture that you thought \nwere ironclad but turn out to be \nmalleable. It’s common, for example, to \nreceive e-mails from your boss af ter \nhours. Fixed-schedule productivity \nwould have you ignore these messages \nuntil the next morning. Many suspect that \nthis would cause problems, as such \nresponses are expected , but in many \ncases, the fact that your boss happens to \nbe clearing her inbox at night doesn’t \nmean that she expects an immediate \nresponse—a lesson this strategy would \nsoon help you discover.\n\nFixed-schedule productivity, in other \nwords, is a meta-habit  that’s simple to \nadopt but broad in its impact. If you have \nto choose just one behavior that \nreorients your focus toward the deep, \nthis one should be high on your list of \npossibilities. If you’re still not sure, \nhowever, about the idea that artificial \nlimits on your workday can make you \nmore successful, I urge you to once again \nturn your attention to the career of fixed- \nschedule advocate Radhika Nagpal.

Resistance is futile.\nThis strategy pushes back at this \nfatalism. Just because you cannot avoid \nthis tool altogether doesn’t mean you \nhave to cede all authority over its role in \nyour mental landscape. In the following \nsections I describe three tips that will\n\nhelp you regain authority over how this \ntechnology accesses your time and \nattention, and arrest the erosion of \nautonomy identified by Freeman. \nResistance is not futile: You have more \ncontrol over your electronic \ncommunication than you might at first \nassume.\nTip #1 : Make People Who  \nSend You E-mail Do More  \nWork\nMost nonfiction authors are easy to \nreach. They include an e-mail address \non their author websites along with an\n\nopen invitation to send them any request \nor suggestion that comes to mind. Many \neven encourage this feedback as a \nnecessary commitment to the elusive but \nmuch-touted importance of “community \nbuilding” among their readers. But \nhere’s the thing: I  don '  buy it.\nIf you visit the contact page on my \nauthor website, there’s no general- \npurpose e-mail address. Instead, I list \ndifferent individuals you can contact for \nspecific purposes: my literary agent for \nrights requests, for example, or my \nspeaking agent for speaking requests. If \nyou want to reach me, I offer only a \nspecial-purpose e-mail address that \ncomes with conditions and a lowered\n\nexpectation that I’ll respond:\nI f  you have an offer, opportunity,  \nor introduction that might make  \nmy life more interesting, e-mail  \nme at interesting [at]  \ncalnewport.com .  For the\nreasons stated above, I ’ ll only  \nrespond to those proposals that  \nare a good match fo r my  \nschedule and interests.\nI call this approach a sender filter , \nas I’m asking my correspondents to filter \nthemselves before attempting to contact \nme. This filter has significantly reduced \nthe time I spend in my inbox. Before I\n\nbegan using a sender filter, I had a \nstandard general-purpose e-mail address \nlisted on my website. Not surprisingly, I \nused to receive a large volume of long e­\nmails asking for advice on specific (and \noften quite complicated) student or \ncareer questions. I like to help \nindividuals, but these requests became \noverwhelming—they didn’t take the \nsenders long to craft but they would \nrequire a lot of explanation and writing \non my part to respond. My sender filter \nhas eliminated most such \ncommunication, and in doing so, has \ndrastically reduced the number of \nmessages I encounter in my writing \ninbox. As for my own interest in helping\n\nmy readers, I now redirect this energy \ntoward settings I carefully choose to \nmaximize impact. Instead of allowing \nany student in the world to send me a \nquestion, for example, I now work \nclosely with a small number of student \ngroups where I’m quite accessible and \ncan offer more substantial and effective \nmentoring.\nAnother benefit of a sender filter is \nthat it resets expectations. The most \ncrucial line in my description is the \nfollowing: “I’ll only respond to those \nproposals that are a good match for my \nschedule and interests.” This seems \nminor, but it makes a substantial \ndifference in how my correspondents\n\nthink about their messages to me. The \ndefault social convention surrounding e­\nmail is that unless you’re famous, if \nsomeone sends you something, you owe",

For example, an editor \nof an online publication once sent me a \nguest post opportunity with the\nassumption, set by my filter, that I would \nlikely not respond.

He didn’ t have\n\nanything on his [sender filter]  \nabout wanting to guest blog, so  \nthere wouldn’ t have been any  \nhardfeelings if I ’ d never heard a  \npeep. Then, when he did respond,  \nI  was thrilled.\nMy particular sender filter is just one \nexample of this general strategy. \nConsider consultant Clay Herbert, who \nis an expert in running crowd-funding \ncampaigns for technology start-ups: a \nspecialty that attracts a lot of \ncorrespondents hoping to glean some \nhelpful advice. As a Forbes.com article \non sender filters reports, “At some point, \nthe number of people reaching out\n\nexceeded [Herbert’s] capacity, so he \ncreated filters that put the onus on the \nperson asking for help.”\nThough he started from a similar \nmotivation as me, Herbert’s filters ended \nup taking a different form. To contact \nhim, you must first consult an FAQ to \nmake sure your question has not already \nbeen answered (which was the case for \na lot of the messages Herbert was \nprocessing before his filters were in \nplace). If you make it through this FAQ \nsieve, he then asks you to fill out a \nsurvey that allows him to further screen \nfor connections that seem particularly \nrelevant to his expertise. For those who \nmake it past this step, Herbert enforces a\n\nsmall fee you must pay before \ncommunicating with him. This fee is not \nabout making extra money, but is instead \nabout selecting for individuals who are \nserious about receiving and acting on \nadvice. Herbert’s filters still enable him \nto help people and encounter interesting \nopportunities. But at the same time, they \nhave reduced his incoming \ncommunication to a level he can easily \nhandle.\nTo give another example, consider \nAntonio Centeno, who runs the popular \nReal Man Style  blog. Centeno’s sender \nfilter lays out a two-step process. If you \nhave a question, he diverts you to a \npublic location to post it. Centeno thinks\n\nit’s wasteful to answer the same \nquestions again and again in private one- \non-one conversations. If you make it past \nthis step, he then makes you commit to, \nby clicking check boxes, the following \nthree promises:\n/  I am not asking Antonio a style \nquestion I could find searching \nGoogle for 10 minutes.\n/  I am not SPAMMING Antonio \nwith a cut-and-pasting generic \nrequest to promote my unrelated \nbusiness.\n/  I will do a good deed for some \nrandom stranger if Antonio\n\nresponds within 23 hours.\nThe message box in which you can \ntype your message doesn’t appear on the \ncontact page until after you’ve clicked \nthe box by all three promises.\nTo",

The \ndefault social convention surrounding e­\nmail is that unless you’re famous, if \nsomeone sends you something, you owe \nhim or her a response. For most, \ntherefore, an inbox full of messages \ngenerates a major sense of obligation.\nBy instead resetting your \ncorrespondents’  expectations to the \nreality that you’ll probably not respond, \nthe experience is transformed. The inbox \nis now a collection of opportunities that \nyou can glance at when you have the free \ntime— seeking out those that make sense \nfor you to engage. But the pile of unread \nmessages no longer generates a sense of \nobligation. You could, if you wanted to,\n\nignore them all, and nothing bad would \nhappen. Psychologically, this can be \nfreeing.\nI worried when I first began using a \nsender filter that it would seem \npretentious—as if my time was more \nvaluable than that of my readers—and \nthat it would upset people.

I’d love to follow up on some of \nthose issues we discussed. Do you want \nto grab coffee?”\nE-mail #2 :  “We should get back to the \nresearch problem we discussed during \nmy last visit. Remind me where we are \nwith that?”\n\nE-mail #3 :  “I took a stab at that article \nwe discussed. It’s attached. Thoughts?”\nThese three examples should be \nfamiliar to most knowledge workers, as \nthey’re representative of many of the \nmessages that fill their inboxes. They’re \nalso potential productivity land mines: \nHow you respond to them will have a \nsignificant impact on how much time and \nattention the resulting conversation \nultimately consumes.\nIn particular, interrogative e-mails \nlike these generate an initial instinct to \ndash off the quickest possible response \nthat will clear the message—temporarily \n—out of your inbox. A quick response\n\nwill, in the short term, provide you with \nsome minor relief because you’re \nbouncing the responsibility implied by \nthe message off your court and back onto \nthe sender’s. This relief, however, is \nshort-lived, as this responsibility will \ncontinue to bounce back again and again, \ncontinually sapping your time and \nattention. I suggest, therefore, that the \nright strategy when faced with a question \nof this type is to pause a moment before \nreplying and take the time to answer the \nfollowing key prompt:\nWhat is the  project represented  \nby this message, and what is the  \nmost efficient (in terms o f\n\nmessages generated)  process fo r \nbringing this project to a  \nsuccessful conclusion?\nOnce you’ve answered this question \nfor yourself, replace a quick response \nwith one that takes the time to describe \nthe process you identified, points out the \ncurrent step, and emphasizes the step that \ncomes next. I call this the process­\ncentric approach  to e-mail, and it’s \ndesigned to minimize both the number of \ne-mails you receive and the amount of \nmental clutter they generate.\nTo better explain this process and \nwhy it works consider the following \nprocess-centric responses to the sample\n\ne-mails from earlier:\nProcess-Centric Response to E-mail\n#1:  “I’d love to grab coffee. Let’s meet \nat the Starbucks on campus. Below I \nlisted two days next week when I’m \nfree. For each day, I listed three times. If \nany of those day and time combinations \nwork for you, let me know. I’ll consider \nyour reply confirmation for the meeting. \nIf none of those date and time \ncombinations work, give me a call at the \nnumber below and we’ll hash out a time \nthat works. Looking forward to it.”\nProcess-Centric Response to E-mail\n#2:  “I agree that we should return to this \nproblem. Here’s what I suggest...\n\n“Sometime in the next week e-mail \nme everything you remember about our \ndiscussion on the problem. Once I \nreceive that message, I’ll start a shared \ndirectory for the project and add to it a \ndocument that summarizes what you sent \nme, combined with my own memory of \nour past discussion. In the document, I’ll \nhighlight the two or three most promising \nnext steps.\n“We can then take a crack at those \nnext steps for a few weeks",

Notice, the word \n“project” is used loosely here. It can \ncover things that are large and obviously \nprojects, such as making progress on a \nresearch problem (Example #2), but it \napplies just as easily to small logistical \nchallenges like setting up a coffee \nmeeting (Example #1). I then took a \nminute or two to think through a process \nthat gets us from the current state to a\n\ndesired outcome with a minimum of \nmessages required. The final step was to \nwrite a reply that clearly describes this \nprocess and where we stand. These \nexamples centered on an e-mail reply, \nbut it should be clear that a similar \napproach also works when writing an e­\nmail message from scratch.\nThe process-centric approach to e­\nmail can significantly mitigate the impact \nof this technology on your time and \nattention. There are two reasons for this \neffect. First, it reduces the number of e­\nmails in your inbox—sometimes \nsignificantly (something as simple as \nscheduling a coffee meeting can easily \nspiral into half a dozen or more\n\nmessages over a period of many days, if \nyou’re not careful about your replies). \nThis, in turn, reduces the time you spend \nin your inbox and reduces the \nbrainpower you must expend when you \ndo.\nSecond, to steal terminology from \nDavid Allen, a good process-centric \nmessage immediately “closes the loop” \nwith respect to the project at hand. When \na project is initiated by an e-mail that \nyou send or receive, it squats in your \nmental landscape—becoming something \nthat’s “on your plate” in the sense that it \nhas been brought to your attention and \neventually needs to be addressed. This \nmethod closes this open loop as soon as\n\nit forms. By working through the whole \nprocess, adding to your task lists and \ncalendar any relevant commitments on \nyour part, and bringing the other party up \nto speed, your mind can reclaim the \nmental real estate the project once \ndemanded. Less mental clutter means \nmore mental resources available for \ndeep thinking.\nProcess-centric e-mails might not \nseem natural at first. For one thing, they \nrequire that you spend more time \nthinking about your messages before you \ncompose them. In the moment, this might \nseem like you’re spending more  time on \ne-mail. But the important point to \nremember is that the extra two to three\n\nminutes you spend at this point will save \nyou many more minutes reading and \nresponding to unnecessary extra \nmessages later.\nThe other issue is that process­\ncentric messages can seem stilted and \noverly technical. The current social \nconventions surrounding e-mail promote \na conversational tone that clashes with \nthe more systematic schedules or \ndecision trees commonly used in \nprocess-centric communication. If this \nconcerns you, I suggest that you add a \nlonger conversational preamble to your \nmessages. You can even separate the \nprocess-centric portion of the message \nfrom the conversational opening with a\n\ndivider line, or label it “Proposed Next \nSteps,” so that its technical tone seems \nmore appropriate in context.\nIn the end, these minor hassles are \nworth it. By putting more thought up \nfront into what’s really being proposed \nby the e-mail messages that flit in and \nout of your inbox, you",

If you didn’t \nmake a convincing case and sufficiently \nminimize the effort required by the \nprofessor to respond, you didn’t get a \nresponse.\nFor example, the following e-mail \nwould likely not generate a reply with \nmany of the famous names at the\n\nInstitute:\nHi professor. I ’ d love to stop by  \nsometime to talk about <topic  \nX>. Are you available?\nResponding to this message requires \ntoo much work (“Are you available?” is \ntoo vague to be answered quickly). \nAlso, there’s no attempt to argue that this \nchat is worth the professor’s time. With \nthese critiques in mind, here’s a version \nof the same message that would be more \nlikely to generate a reply:\nHi professor. I ’ m working on a  \nproject similar to <topic X>\n\nwith my advisor, <professor Y>.\nIs it okay if I  stop by in the last  \nfifteen minutes o f your office  \nhours on Thursday to explain  \nwhat w e’ re up to in more detail  \nand see if it might complement  \nyour current project?\nUnlike the first message, this one \nmakes a clear case for why this meeting \nmakes sense and minimizes the effort \nneeded from the receiver to respond.\nThis tip asks that you replicate, to the \nextent feasible in your professional \ncontext, this professorial ambivalence to \ne-mail. To help you in this effort, try \napplying the following three rules to sort\n\nthrough which messages require a \nresponse and which do not.\nProfessorial E-mail Sorting:  Do not \nreply to an e-mail message if any of the \nfollowing applies:\n• It’s ambiguous or otherwise makes \nit hard for you to generate a \nreasonable response.\n• It’s not a question or proposal that \ninterests you.\n• Nothing really good would happen \nif you did respond and nothing \nreally bad would happen if you \ndidn’t.\n\nIn all cases, there are many obvious \nexceptions. If an ambiguous message \nabout a project you don’t care about \ncomes from your company’s CEO, for \nexample, you’ll respond. But looking \nbeyond these exceptions, this \nprofessorial approach asks you to \nbecome way more ruthless when \ndeciding whether or not to click “reply.” \nThis tip can be uncomfortable at first \nbecause it will cause you to break a key \nconvention currently surrounding e-mail: \nReplies are assumed, regardless of the \nrelevance or appropriateness of the \nmessage. There’s also no way to avoid \nthat some bad things will happen if you \ntake this approach. At the minimum,\n\nsome people might get confused or upset \n—especially if they’ve never seen \nstandard e-mail conventions questioned \nor ignored. Here’s the thing: This is \nokay. As the author Tim Ferriss once \nwrote: “Develop the habit of letting \nsmall bad things happen. If you don’t, \nyou’ll never find time for the life­\nchanging big things.” It should comfort \nyou to realize that, as the professors at \nMIT discovered, people are quick to \nadjust their expectations to the specifics \nof your communication habits. The fact \nyou didn’t respond to their hastily \nscribed messages is probably not a \ncentral event in their lives.\nOnce you get past the discomfort of\n\nthis approach, you’ll begin to experience \nits rewards. There are two common \ntropes bandied around when people \ndiscuss solutions to e-mail overload. \nOne says that sending e-mails generates \nmore e-mails, while the other says that \nwrestling with ambiguous or irrelevant \ne-mails is a major source of inbox- \nrelated stress. The approach suggested \nhere responds aggressively to both \nissues—you send fewer e-mails and \nignore those that aren’t easy to process \n—and by doing so will significantly \nweaken the grip your inbox maintains \nover your time and attention.",

If you didn’t \nmake a convincing case and sufficiently \nminimize the effort required by the \nprofessor to respond, you didn’t get a \nresponse.\nFor example, the following e-mail \nwould likely not generate a reply with \nmany of the famous names at the\n\nInstitute:\nHi professor. I ’ d love to stop by  \nsom",
