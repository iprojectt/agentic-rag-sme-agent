Once you have diagnosed the habit loop of a particular behavior, you can look for ways to supplant old vices with new routines.\nAs an example, let’s say you have a bad habit, like I did when I \nstarted researching this book, of going to the cafeteria and buying a chocolate chip cookie every afternoon. Let’s say this habit has caused you to gain a few pounds. In fact, let’s say this habit has caused you to gain exactly 8 pounds, and that your wife has made a few pointed com-ments. You’ve tried to force yourself to  stop— you even went so far as to put a  post- it on your computer that reads “NO MORE COOKIES”.\nBut every afternoon you manage to ignore that note, get up, wan-\nder towards the cafeteria, buy a cookie and, while chatting with col-leagues around the cash register, eat it. It feels good, and then it feels bad. Tomorrow, you promise yourself, you’ll muster the will-power to resist. Tomorrow will be different.\nBut tomorrow, the habit takes hold again.How do you start diagnosing and then changing this behavior? \nBy ﬁ guring out the habit loop. And the ﬁ  rst step is to identify the \nroutine. In this cookie  scenario— as with most  habits— the routine is the most obvious aspect: it’s the behavior you want to change. Your routine is that you get up from your desk in the afternoon, walk to the cafeteria, buy a chocolate chip cookie and eat it while chatting with friends. So that’s what you put into the loop:\nRoutine\nReward Cue\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.ind",

Is it hunger? Boredom? Low blood sugar? That you need a break before plunging into another task?\nAnd what’s the reward? The cookie itself? The change of scen-\nery? The temporary distraction? Socializing with colleagues? Or the burst of energy that comes from that blast of sugar?\nTo ﬁ gure this out, you’ll need to do a little experimentation.\nSTEP TWO: EXPERIMENT WITH REWARDS\nRewards are powerful because they satisfying cravings. But we’re \noften not conscious of the cravings that drive our behaviors. When the Febreze marketing team discovered that consumers desired a fresh scent at the end of a cleaning ritual, for example, they had found a craving that no one even knew existed. It was hiding in plain sight. Most cravings are like this: obvious in retrospect, but incredibly hard to see when we are under their sway.\nTo ﬁ gure out which cravings are driving particular habits, it’s \nuseful to experiment with different rewards.

Because the point of these tests \nis to determine the reward you’re craving. If, ﬁ  fteen minutes after \neating a donuts, you still feel an urge to get up and go to the cafete-\nria, then your habit isn ’t motivated by a sugar craving. If, after gos-siping at a colleague’s desk, you still want a cookie, then the need for human contact isn ’t what’s driving your behavior.\nOn the other hand, if ﬁ  fteen minutes after chatting with a friend, \nyou ﬁ  nd it easy to get back to work, then you’ve identiﬁ  ed the \n reward— temporary distraction and  socialization— that your habit sought to satisfy.\nBy experimenting with different rewards, you can isolate what \nyou are actually craving, which is essential in redesigning the habit.\nRoutine\nReward Cue\nOnce you’ve ﬁ  gured out the routine and the reward, what re-\nmains is identifying the cue.\nSTEP THREE: ISOLATE THE CUE\nAbout a decade ago, a psychologist at the University of Western On-\ntario tried to answer a question that had bewildered social scientists for years: Why do some eyewitnesses of crimes misremember what they see, while other recall events accurately?\nThe recollections of eyewitnesses, of course, are incredibly im-\nportant. And yet studies indicate that eyewitnesses often misre-\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   280 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   280 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/11   12:02 PM\nmember what they observe. They insist that the thief was a man, for \ninstance, when she was wearing a skirt; or that the crime occurred at dusk, even though police reports say it happened at 2:00 in the afternoon. Other eyewitnesses, on the other hand, can remember the crimes they’ve seen with  near- perfect recall.\nDozens of studies have examined this phenomena, trying to de-\ntermine why some people are better eyewitnesses than others. Re-searchers theorized that some people simply have better memories, or that a crime that occurs in a familiar place is easier to recall. But those theories didn ’t test  out— people with strong and weak memo-ries, or more and less familiarity with the scene of a crime, were equally liable to misremember what took place.\nThe psychologist at the University of Western Ontario took a dif-\nferent approach. She wondered if researchers were making a mis-take by focusing on what questioners and witnesses had said, rather than how they were saying it. She suspected there were subtle cues \nthat were inﬂ  uencing the questioning process.

She saw that witnesses who misremembered facts usually \nwere questioned by cops who used a gentle, friendly tone. When witnesses smiled more, or sat closer to the person asking the ques-tions, they were more likely to misremember.\nIn other words, when environmental cues said “we are friends”—a \ngentle tone, a smiling  face— the witnesses were more likely to misre-member what had occurred. Perhaps it was because, subconsciously, those friendship cues triggered a habit to please the questioner.\nBut the importance of this experiment is that those same tapes \nhad been watched by dozens of other researchers. Lots of smart peo-ple had seen the same patterns, but no one had recognized them before. Because there was too much information in each tape to see \na subtle cue.\nOnce the psychologist decided to focus on only three categories \nof behavior, however, and eliminate the extraneous information, the patterns leapt out.\nOur lives are the same way. The reason why it is so hard to iden-\ntify the cues that trigger our habits is because there is too much in-formation bombarding us as our behaviors unfold. Ask yourself, do you eat breakfast at a certain time each day because you are hungry? Or because the clock says 7:30? Or because your kids have started eating? Or because you’re dressed, and that’s when the breakfast habit kicks in?\nWhen you automatically turn your car left while driving to work, \nwhat triggers that behavior? A street sign? A particular tree? The knowledge that this is, in fact, the correct route? All of them to-gether? When you’re driving your kid to school, and you ﬁ  nd that \nyou’ve absentmindedly started taking the route to  work— rather than to the  school— what caused the mistake? What was the cue that caused the ‘drive to work’ habit to kick in, rather than the ‘drive to school’ pattern?\nTo identify a cue amid the noise, we can use the same system as \nthe psychologist: Identify categories of behaviors ahead of time to \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   282 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   282 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/11   12:02 PM\nAppendix ● 283\nscrutinize in order to see patterns.

And the habit, I now knew, was triggered between 3:00 and 4:00.\nRoutine\nReward Cue\nSTEP FOUR: HAVE A PLAN\nOnce you’ve ﬁ  gured out your habit  loop— you’ve identiﬁ  ed the re-\nward driving your behavior, the cue triggering it, and the routine  itself— you can begin to shift the behavior. You can change to a bet-ter routine by planning for the cue, and choosing a behavior that delivers the reward you are craving. What you need is a plan.\nIn the prologue, we learned that a habit is a choice that we delib-\nerately make at some point, and then stop thinking about, but con-tinue doing, often every day.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   284 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   284 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/11   12:02 PM\nAppendix ● 285\nPut another way, a habit is a formula our brain automatically fol-\nlows: When I see CUE, I will do ROUTINE in order to get a REWARD.\nTo  re- engineer that formula, we need to begin making choices \nagain. And the easiest way to do this, according to study after study, is to have a plan. Within psychology, these plans are known as ‘im-plementation intentions.’\nTake, for instance, my  cookie- in- the- afternoon habit. By using \nthis framework, I learned that my cue was roughly 3:30 in the after-noon. I knew that my routine was to go to the cafeteria, buy a cookie and chat with friends. And, through experimentation, I had learned that it wasn ’t really the cookie I  craved— rather, it was a moment of distraction and the opportunity to socialize.\nSo, I wrote a plan:\nAt 3:30, every day, I will walk to a friend’s desk \nand talk for 10 minutes.\nTo make sure I remembered to do this, I set the alarm on my \nwatch for 3:30.\nIt didn ’t work immediately. There were some days I was too busy \nand ignored the alarm, and then fell off the wagon. Other times it seemed like too much work to ﬁ  nd a friend willing to  chat— it was \neasier to get a cookie, and so I gave in to the urge. But on those day that I abided by my  plan— when my alarm went off, I forced myself to walk to a friend’s desk and chat for 10  minutes— I found that I ended the workday feeling better. I hadn ’t gone to the cafeteria, I hadn ’t eat a cookie, and I felt ﬁ  ne. Eventually, it got be automatic: \nwhen the alarm rang, I found a friend, and ended the day feeling a small, but real, sense of accomplishment. After a few weeks, I hardly thought about the routine anymore. And when I couldn ’t ﬁ  nd any-\none to chat with, I went to the cafeteria and bought tea and drank it with friends.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   285 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   285 10/17/11   12:02 PM 10/17/11   12:02 PM\nThat all happened about six months ago. I don ’t have my watch \n anymore— I lost it at some point. But at about 3:30 everyday, I ab-sentmindedly stand up, look around the newsroom for someone to talk to, spend 10 minutes gossiping about the news, and then go back to my desk. It occurs almost without me thinking about it. It has become a habit.286 ● Appendix\nRoutine\nReward Cue\nObviously, changing some habits can be more difﬁ  cult. But this \nframework is a place to start. Sometimes change takes a long time. Sometimes it requires repeated experiments and failures. But once you understand how a habit  operates— once you diagnose the cue, the routine and the  reward— you gain power over it.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   286 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   286 10/17/11   12",
