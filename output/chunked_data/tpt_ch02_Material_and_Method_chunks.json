The initial aim of tracking and later recording could simply be \nto present a report with the number of Pomodoros completed per task. In other words, you may \nwant to show the effort expended to accomplish each activity. To do so, the following boxes \ncan be used: the date, start time, type of activity, description of the activity, the actual number \nof Pomodoros, a short note on the results achieved, and possible room for improvement, or \nproblems that may have come up (fig. 2.9).

That seems like too many. Mark would \nreally like to get the same result with nine Pomodoros or less. Then he would have one or more \nPomodoros for free time for other activities. “I’d like to try to write the next article with the \nsame quality and less effort. How? What should I cut out? What activities are really useful? \nHow can I reorganize them to be more effective?” This is the type of question that enables \npeople to improve, or at least to try to improve, their work or study processes. At the end of the \nday, the activity of recording and later looking for ways to improve should not take more than \none Pomodoro. \n2.1.6  The Nature of the Pomodoro \nThe Pomodoro marks the passage of time, and so it is itself a measure of the dimension of time. \nIt becomes a measure of the dimension of effort wh en it is combined with the number of people \ninvolved in an activity. Depending on this number, we can say that a given task was \naccomplished with a certain number of Person Pomodoros or Pair Pomodoros or Team \nPomodoros, where these units measure effort. The quantities of effort relative to different \nnumbers of people are not homogeneous; they can’t  be added together or compared with one \nanother. The work of an individual, a pair or a group represents a different way of combining \nproduction factors and also diverse means of  c o m m u n i c a t i o n .  T h e r e  a r e  n o  f o r m u l a s  f o r  \nconverting Person Pomodoros to Pa ir Pomodoros or Team Pomodoros. \n \nNote   Let’s say we want to measure the cost of an activity performed by more than one person, \neither individually, in pairs, or in teams. By  applying a monetary measurement it’s clear we can \ncompare and add up the different amounts of effort. For example, let’s take an activity that’s \nachieved by the effort of 2 Person Pomodoros and 3 Pair Pomodoros. In terms of effort, these \namounts can not be directly compared or summed in any way. However, by assigning a \nmonetary value for the effort of one Pomodoro, for example €10.00, we can actually say that the \nactivity costs 2 x € 10.00+ 3 x 2 x € 10.00 = € 80.00. \n  \n \nNota   The paper Applying the Pomodoro Technique in Teams  explains how to track and record \npair or group work. \n \n2.2 Objective II: Cut Down on Interruptions \nThe length of a Pomodoro, 25 minutes, seems short enough to make it possible to resist being \ndistracted by various kinds of interruptions. But experience shows that once you’ve started \nusing the Pomodoro Technique, interruptions can become a real problem. That’s why an \neffective strategy is needed for minimizing unhandled interruptions and progressively \nincreasing the number of Pomodoros that can be accomplished consistently without \ninterruptions. There are two kinds of interruptions: internal and external. \n2.2.1  Internal Interrupti ons – We Interrupt Ourselves \nEven though a Pomodoro only lasts 25 minutes, it won’t be easy for everyone to finish the first \nfew Pomodoros without giving in to some immediate need to interrupt the activity at hand: the \nneed to stand up and get something to eat or drink, or to make a call that suddenly seems \nterribly urgent, or to look up something on the Internet this minute (it may be related or \nunrelated to the task at hand) or to check email this instant. Lastly, we might even need to \nrethink how we’ve prioritized this particular activity; we’re constantly second-guessing our \ndaily planning or our decisions. \nThese kinds of distractions, or ways to procrastinate on the activity at hand, are called \ninternal interruptions. They generally disguise our fear of not being able to finish what we’re \nworking on the way we want and when we want.

Maybe even until tomorrow!” Mark puts an apostrophe on the To Do Today Sheet next to \nthe current activity (fig. 2.10), adds an item to the Activity Inventory for unplanned activities \n(marked with a “U” – fig. 2.11) and continues with the Pomodoro.  \n \n TO DO TODAY Rome, 12 July 2006 \nMark Ross \n \nWrite article on How to Learn Music  (max 10 pps) ’  \n! \n Finetune How to Learn Music by reading it out loud   \n  Condense How to Learn Music  to 3 pps  \nFigure 2.10    To Do Today Sheet: An internal interruption.  \n \n ACTIVITY INVENTORY Mark Ross \n …   \nN Call Carol: When’s the next rock concert?  \n …   \nFigure 2.11    Activity Inventory Sheet: An unplanned activity.  \n \nThen Mark asks himself: “Does this activity have to be done by tomorrow?

But that’s \nhow Mark perceives them. The point to emphasize here is that with the Pomodoro Technique, \nlots of useful or fun things to do come up, but we make a conscious decision not to do them \nright away during the current Pomodoro. Reading through the various activities and the urgency \nwe assign to each, we can see how much our mind is moving, and how hard it is to keep it still \nand focus on the activity at hand. Often the number and variety of attempted internal \ninterruptions are symptoms of our fear of failure in completing the task at hand.  \nThe Pomodoro Technique 12 \n \n \n© Francesco Cirillo 19/10/2006 It should come as no surprise that many of these distractions later prove to be anything \nbut urgent, even to the person who wrote them down. Most likely at the end of the Pomodoro or \nthe activity or the day, several items marked urgent or absolute priority will be handled in \ndifferent ways.  \n! They’ll be moved to the Activity Inventory. Maybe we can pick out a bike tomorrow. \n! They’ll be done during longer breaks. That’s the time to look up jazz concerts in Rome in \nJuly, for example. \n! They’ll be deleted. Does Mark really want to order a pizza along with spring rolls and \nPeking duck? He might even realize he doesn’t want to order anything and he’ll eat at the \nend of the day. \nIt’s a different mind that reads over those items at the end of a Pomodoro, or a set of \nfour, or at the end of the day, and it’s some times surprising. Truly urgent tasks are always \nhighlighted on the To Do Today Sheet. The aim of the Pomodoro Technique is to ensure that \nthe current Pomodoro isn’t interrupted by these activities. Instead, the following options are \navailable:  \n! They can be done during the next Pomodoro (but still measured by a Pomodoro), in place \nof other activities. \n! They can be re-scheduled sometime during the day, in place of other activities. \n! They can be moved from Pomodoro to Pomodoro if possible till the end of the day. This \nhelps us gradually learn to recognize what’s really urgent. \nIf and when unplanned urgent activities are done during the day, the relative \nPomodoros are marked down in the proper space (fig. 2.16). In all the cases discussed so far, the \ninterruptions can be considered handled. Note that the mechanism for handling interruptions \nconsists of inverting the dependency on internal interruptions, and consequently making these \ninterruptions depend on the Pomodoros we decide to slot them into.  \n \n TO DO TODAY Rome, 12 July 2006 \nMark Ross \n \nWrite article on How to Learn Music  (max 10 pps) ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ \n!! \n Finetune How to Learn Music  by reading it out loud  \n  Condense How to Learn Music to 3 pps",

What should you do? \nExternal interruptions call for the ability to “protect” the ticking Pomodoro. Up till now \na major effort has been made to eliminate internal interruptions. Now the risk is that someone \non the outside prevents you from having the pleasure of marking an X on your To Do Today \nSheet. \nThe main difference between internal and external interruptions is that with the latter \nwe need to interact with other people: we need to communicate. The mechanism for dealing \nwith external interruptions is the same as that for internal ones: invert the dependency on \ninterruptions, and make the interruptions depend on us. \nA few examples are helpful to clarify what  w e  a c t u a l l y  n e e d  t o d o .  I n c o m i n g  p h o n e  \ncalls can always be taken by the answering machine and messages listened to later. Emails can \nkeep coming in without distracting our attention simply by deactivating acoustic signals for \nincoming messages. If a colleague or study partner comes over, you can politely say you’re \nbusy and can’t be interrupted. (Some people use the humorous expression “I’m in the middle of \na Pomodoro.”) Then tell the person that you’d rather call them back in 25 minutes, or in a few \nhours, or tomorrow, depending on how urgent and important the matter is.  \nSpeaking from experience, true emergencies that need to be dealt with instantly are rare \nin real life. A 25-minute or 2-hour delay (four  Pomodoros) is almost  always possible for \nactivities that are commonly cons idered urgent. This delay isn’t usually detrimental to the \nperson who wants to communicate with you, but gives you an enormous advantage in terms of \nmaking your mind work effectively, finishing activities the way you want to and rescheduling \nurgent tasks. With practice, you’ll come to real ize how often apparently urgent activities can \neven be postponed till the following day while still satisfying the person making the request.  \nSo, Protect the Pomodoro means: inform effectively, negotiate quickly to reschedule \nthe interruption, and call back the person who interrupted you as agreed. The Inform, Negotiate, \nCall Back Strategy enables you to control external interruptions by simply rescheduling them in \na later Pomodoro the same day or another day according to the degree of urgency. The \ndependency inversion for interruptions lies in this mechanism: We’re no longer dependent on \ninterruptions, interruptions depend on us (i.e. the Pomodoros we allocate for calling back). \nThe feedback from people who start applying the Pomodoro Technique is often the \nsame: they discover they can have up to 10 or even ",

The most natural and most \ncommon decision is to set aside one Pomodoro a day (or more if need be) to take care of urgent \ninterruptions. The dependency inversion mechanism applied to protect the current Pomodoro \nactually serves to turn interruptions into Pomodoros dedicated to forms of communication. We \nshould emphasize that Pomodoro users have the following objectives: \n! To successfully delay these Pomodoros as far as possible, downgrading the degree of \napparent urgency and incrementing the extent to which these activities can be controlled \nand scheduled \n! To gradually cut down on the number of Pomodoros used for organizing the interruptions \nthat come up throughout the day \nPeople who start applying the Pomodoro Technique are always amazed when they \nmeasure the Pomodoros spent on work and study (without unhandled interruptions) and those \nused for organizational activities (which in part come from dealing with interruptions).

    "text": ", interruptions depend on us (i.e. the Pomodoros we allocate for calling back). \nThe feedback from people who start applying the Pomodoro Technique is often the \nsame: they discover they can have up to 10 or even 15 external interruptions during a single \nPomodoro (25 minutes). If the people doing the interrupting learn that you’ll really call them \nback, and you’re not just putting them off, it won’t take long to see our habitual interrupters \nactually protecting the Pomodoro too. Many people who work with Pomodoro users say they \nhave the feeling they’re working or studying with people who know how to appreciate the value \nof their own time. In operational terms, handling this type of interruption is like dealing with \ninternal interruptions. In this case, too, we work on two fronts simultaneously: \n! Make these interruptions clearly visible. Every time someone or something tries to interrupt \na Pomodoro, put a dash (-) on the sheet where you record your Pomodoros, apply the \nInform, Negotiate, and Call Strategy.

By doing so, during the planning \nphase you can assess your ability to identify the number and type of activity that’s most \neffective in reaching a given obje ctive.

So, you can measure the unplanned \nactivities done to attain a certain objective. Clearly, you can also include the total number of \ninternal and external interruptions on the Records Sheet to observe them and try to minimize \nthem over time. \nThe Pomodoro Technique 15 \n \n \n© Francesco Cirillo 19/10/2006 2.3 Objective III: Estimate the Effort for Activities \nOnce you’ve begun to master the technique and y ou’ve reached the first two objectives, you can \nstart working on quantitative estimates. The long-term objective here is to successfully predict \nthe effort that an activity requires.  \nThe Activity Inventory lists all the activities that need to be done. These tasks come \nfrom planning, which is needed to identify ways to reach your objectives  (for example, at the \nbeginning of a project) and to deal with interruptions. Some activities lose their purpose over \ntime, so they can be deleted from the Inventory. \n A t  t h e  s t a r t  o f  e a c h  d a y ,  e s t i m a t e  h o w  m a n y  P o m o d o r o s  e a c h  a c t i v i t y  i n  t h e  I n v e n t o r y  \nwill take. Revise previous estimates, if need be. Record the estimated number of Pomodoros on \nthe relative line (fig. 2.19). The Pomodoro estimate actually represents the number of \nPomodoros needed for a certain number of people to accomplish an activity. So, this is a \nmeasure of effort. However, in the simple ex amples that follow, the number of Pomodoros \nalways refers to one person. \n \n ACTIVITY INVENTORY Lucy Banks \n …   \n Answer questions on thermodynamics in Ch 4 2 \n Repeat laws of thermodynamics out loud to Mark  3 \n S u m m a r i z e  l a w s  o f  t h e r m o d y n a m i c s  i n  w r i t i n g   3  \n Call Laura: invite her to the seminar on thermodynamics  \n C a l l  M a r k :  g i v e  m e  m y  l a p t o p  b a c k  s o o n !    \n Call Andrew: buy tickets to concert?  \n Email Nick: how do you do ex. 2, p. 24?  \n …   \nFigure 2.19    Activity Inventory Sheet: Daily estimate.  \n \nEstimates must always be based on complete  Pomodoros, so figures like 5 ½ Pomodoro \naren’t allowed. In this case, count 6 Pomodoros . If an estimate is greater than 5-7 Pomodoros, \nthis means that the activity in question is too complex. It’s better to break it down into several \nactivities; estimate these activities separately, and write them down on several lines in the \nActivity Inventory. The rule is: If It Takes More Than 5-7 Pomodoros, Break It Down. By \ndoing so, not only do single activities become less complex, but estimates are also more \naccurate. This effect is magnified when the breakdown involves incr emental activities, not \nsimply smaller activities. (Incremental activities deliver a little bit of value at a time.) \nIf the estimate is less than one Pomodoro (e.g. the time it takes to call Laura to invite \nher to the thermodynamics seminar, or to call Mark to ask him to give back the laptop), similar \nactivities should be combined till they add up to one Pomodoro of effort. The rule is: If It Takes \nLess Than One Pomodoro, Add It Up.  So, there are two options for activities estimated to last \nless than one Pom",

Clearly, you can also include the total number of \ninternal and external interruptions on the Records Sheet to observe them and try to minimize \nthem over time. \nThe Pomodoro Technique 15 \n \n \n© Francesco Cirillo 19/10/2006 2.3 Objective III: Estimate the Effort for Activities \nOnce you’ve begun to master the technique and y ou’ve reached the first two objectives, you can \nstart working on quantitative estimates. The long-term objective here is to successfully predict \nthe effort that an activity requires.  \nThe Activity Inventory lists all the activities that need to be done. These tasks come \nfrom planning, which is needed to identify ways to reach your objectives  (for example, at the \nbeginning of a project) and to deal with interruptions. Some activities lose their purpose over \ntime, so they can be deleted from the Inventory. \n A t  t h e  s t a r t  o f  e a c h  d a y ,  e s t i m a t e  h o w  m a n y  P o m o d o r o s  e a c h  a c t i v i t y ",

The next objective is to eliminate the \nsecond estimate, again keeping the overall margin of error small. The final objective is to \nreduce the margin of erro r in the first estimate. \n2.3.4  Managing Exploration \nNot every activity can be estimated. At the outs et of a new project or a study activity, it’s \nespecially beneficial to spend time on exploration: look for new sources, get an idea of the \nstructure of the texts you have to study or consult, define your objectives more clearly. To guide \nexploration, it’s worthwhile to apply the concept of time-boxing. Decide on a number of \nPomodoros for completing your exploration. When these Pomodoros are finished, set up your \nreal work plan or start in on a specific activity  or decide if you want to keep on exploring and \nwhat direction you want to take. \n2.4 Objective IV: Make the Pomodoro More Effective \nWhen you can systematically use the Pomodoro without interruptions, and you start to master \nestimating, you can evolve the Pomodoro Technique even further. \n2.4.1  The Structure of the Pomodoro \nThe first evolution has to do with the structure of the Pomodoro. The first three to five minutes \nof each Pomodoro can be used to briefly repeat what you’ve learned since the beginning of the \nactivity (not just the last Pomodoro), and then to print this in your memory. The last three to \nfive minutes of a Pomodoro can be used to quickly review what you’ve done (if possible, with \nan effect-cause procedure, starting from the last activities and going back to your initial \nmotivations).  \n \nNote    These last few minutes of the Pomodoro serve to review what you’ve done. If you want \nto check the quality and methods of your work to pinpoint potential improvement, you should \nplan one or two Pomodoros to do so. (Quicker observations are made daily during the recording \nPomodoro.) \n \nThese changes don’t require variations in the length of the 25-minute Pomodoro.  The \nenhanced awareness of time you can achieve by using the Pomodoro will enable you to \nphysiologically sense the 3-5 minute intervals mentioned above. If you have a hard time doing \nso, this may be a sign that you haven’t yet mastered the basic technique. \n2.4.2  The Structure",

A timetable sets a limit. Limits (when they’re truly understood as inviolable) help us to be \nconcrete, to do things.

A timetable delineates the separation between work time and free time; the latter is best \ndefined as time set aside for non-goal oriented or unplanned activities  ( 1 5 ) .  T h i s  l e i s u r e  \ntime is fuel for our minds. Without it, creativity, interest, and curiosity are lost, and we run \nourselves down until our energy is depleted. Without gas, the engine won’t run. (4)  \n! A timetable measures the results of the day. Once we’ve written up the To Do Today Sheet, \nour goal is to carry out the activities listed on it with the highest possible quality within the \nset timeframe. If time runs out and these activities aren’t done, we try to understand what \nwent wrong. In the meantime, we already have an invaluable piece of information: how \nmany Pomodoros we managed to work that day. \nWith the Pomodoro Technique, figuring out how much time is wasted isn’t important; \nhow many Pomodoros we’ve accomplished is. The next day, keep that number in mind when \ndeciding how many Pomodoros are available, and write down activities to fill only those \nPomodoros. \n The main risk with the timetable is in underestimating how important it is; it’s easy to \nfall in the trap of not respecting it. For example, let’s say it’s 3 PM. You’ve lost time during the \nday, and you know you haven’t produced as mu ch as you could have or as much as you \nexpected. So you tell yourself: “Today I’ll work late to make up for lost time.” A combination \nof heroism and guilt makes you breach the limit set by the timetable; as a result your \nperformance is ineffective tonight, then tomorrow night, and then the night after. The more the \ntimetable is systematically prolonged, the more overall results will diminish. Guilt intensifies. \nWhy? Isn’t playing the hero enough? Don’t the h ours sacrificed in the name of work assuage \nthe guilt? \n Actually what emerges is a dangerous vicious circle: the timetable protracts, fatigue \nincreases, productivity drops, the timetable protra cts. First and foremost, an effective timetable \nhas to be respected. Respecting a timetable means developing immunity to the Five More \nMinutes Syndrome. When your work time is up, just like when the Pomodoro rings, all activity \nstops. Secondly, an effective timetable has to allow for the free time that’s needed to recoup. \n \nNote  It may happen that an important deadline comes up and you find yourself having to work \nlonger hours. This overtime can  b e  f a c t o r e d  i n  t o  y o u r  t i m e t a b l e  t o  m o m e n t a r i l y  i n c r e a s e  \nproductivity. Typically to achieve positive results and avoid the risk of the vicious circle \nmentioned above, you shouldn’t work overtime for more than five days. Establish an ad hoc  \ntimetable for this period, and set aside a recovery  period to deal with the drop in productivity \nthat will inevitably follow. \n \n2.5.1  The Best Case Scenario \nLet’s use the following timetable as an example: 8:30-1:00 / 2:00-5:30",

In the meantime, we already have an invaluable piece of information: how \nmany Pomodoros we managed to work that day. \nWith the Pomodoro Technique, figuring out how much time is wasted isn’t important; \nhow many Pomodoros we’ve accomplished is. The next day, keep that number in mind when \ndeciding how many Pomodoros are available, and write down activities to fill only those \nPomodoros. \n The main risk with the timetable is in underestimating how important it is; it’s easy to \nfall in the trap of not respecting it. For example, let’s say it’s 3 PM. You’ve lost time during the \nday, and you know you haven’t produced as mu ch as you could have or as much as you \nexpected. So you tell yourself: “Today I’ll work late to make up for lost time.” A combination \nof heroism and guilt makes you breach the limit set by the timetable; as a result your \nperformance is ineffective tonight, then tomorrow night, and then the night after.

Despite the fact that he really wants \nto keep on working, Albert decides to take a bit more downtime in anticipation of the intense \nwork day ahead. After 20 minutes or so, he winds up a new Pomodoro. He continues for a total \nof four Pomodoros, and then checks his watch. It’s 12:53. He has just enough time to tidy up his \ndesk again, put away any papers that need fili ng and check that the To Do Today Sheet is clear \nand properly filled out, and then he goes to lunch. \nBy 2:00 Albert is at his desk again. He winds up the Pomodoro and gets back to work. \nHe doesn’t take much of a break between one Pomodoro and the next. But after four rings he \nstarts feeling tired. He still has a few more Pomodoros to go. He wants to get a good rest, and he \ntries to detach as best he can by taking a little walk. Thirty minutes later, Albert winds up a new \nPomodoro. It rings, X, break. Albert sets aside the last Pomodoro to look over what he got done \nduring the day, fill in the Records Sheet, jot down some comments on potential room for \nimprovement, makes notes on the To Do Today Sheet for the next day, and tidies up his desk. \nThe Pomodoro rings.

W i t h  \neight hours of work/study, two Pomodoros are earmarked for organizational activities (one \nhour) and twelve (six hours) for operational activities. \n! The time that goes by is always a secondary factor with the Pomodoro Technique. If there \nare no unhandled interruptions, the end of the morning or afternoon will be determined \nsimply by the succession of Pomodoros. The timetable is reinforced by sets of Pomodoros. \nIt doesn’t matter what time it is, because our guide is the sequence of Pomodoros with \nrespective breaks. In terms of the timetable in our example, we have [1 +3],[4]:[4],[1+1 ]. \n2.5.2  A Scenario With Interruptions \nLet’s say it’s the second Pomodoro in the second set of the scenario above.  \n A l b e r t  g e t s  i n t e r r u p t e d  a n d  c a n ’ t  d e a l  w i t h  t h e  i n t e r r u p t i o n .

In fact, he decides to \ntake a bit more time to try to find his focus. When he feels ready, Albert winds up the \nPomodoro and starts with the second Pomodoro in the set.

The operational Pomodoros never coincide with  t h e  n u m b e r  o f  w o r k / s t u d y  h o u r s .  W i t h  \neight hours of work/study, two Pomodoros are earmarked for organizational activities (one \nhour) and twelve (six hours) for operational activities. \n! The time that goes by is always a secondary factor with the Pomodoro Technique. If there \nare no unhandled interruptions, the end of the morning or afternoon will be determined \nsimply by the succession of Pomodoros. The timetable is reinforced by sets of Pomodoros. \nIt doesn’t matter what time it",

Optimizing your work schedule is the result of a continual process of observation and \nfeedback. The objective is to reinforce the concept of a regular succession of  activity as much as \npossible. \nFor people who have an entire day to study, an initial timetable might be: 8:30-12:30, \n1:30-5:30. Two sets made up of four and three Pomodoros respectively in the morning, and two \nsets consisting of four and three Pomodoros resp ectively in the afternoon: [4],[3]:[4],[3]. The \nsets determine when to take breaks. \nThe Pomodoros within each set can be organized even further. For example, you could \nearmark the first Pomodoro in the first session for planning your day, and the following three \nfor studying new topics, along with the next two Pomodoros from the second set. The last \nPomodoro in the second group is set aside for checking and answering emails, listening to voice \nmail, and calling classmates, if need be. This is a way to respond effectively to possible \ninterruptions intercepted during the morning. The first Pomodoro of the third set is for looking \nover what you did in the morning. The next three Pomodoros are to spend on studying. The first \ntwo Pomodoros of the fourth set are used to revise what you’ve learned today and in the past \nfew days. The last Pomodoro of the day is destined for tracking and analyzing data. So, your \ntimetable looks something like this: [1 +3],[2+1]:[1+3],[2+1 ]. \nThe basic assumptions with this study schedule are that usually people are more \nproductive in the morning, and more importantly the afternoon hours just after lunch are not \nvery effective. Clearly, these assumptions ar e subjective. Why do we refer to an initial \ntimetable? Because by gathering information on how you work/how you’re working, in other \nwords by tracking metrics of Pomodoros completed and other indicators every day, students can \nlearn to pinpoint which set of Pomodoros is most productive for studying,  revising, or being \ncreative. Knowing this, they can consciously modify their study  schedule, starting earlier or \nlater, extending certain sets and reducing others, learning to know themselves better. \nHere’s the key to organizing a timetable: make conscious decisions on how to set it up. \nUp to this point, sets of four Pomodoros ha ve been used because this amount is usually \nconsidered most effective. But you can also use longer or shorter sets lasting, say, three or five \nPomodoros. At the end of the set comes a 15-30 minute break.

Until now, by simple \ntracking and recording activities, and with very little processing, we’ve come up with useful \nreports on effort per activity, and on errors in qu alitative or quantitative es timates. Clearly, if we \nwant to improve, the reporting objectives will chan ge over time.
