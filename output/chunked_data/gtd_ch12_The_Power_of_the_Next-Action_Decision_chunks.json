Most people have many things just l ike that on \ntheir lists. \nWhy Bright People Procrastinate the Most \nIt's really the smartest people who have the highes t number of \nundecided things in their lives and on their lists.  Why is that? \nThink of how our bodies respond to the images we ho ld in our \nminds. It appears that the nervous system can't tel l the difference \nbetween a well-imagined thought and reality. \nTo prove this to yourself, picture yourself walking  into a \nsupermarket and going over to the brightly lit frui t-and-vegetable \nsection. Are you there? OK, now go to the citrus bi ns—oranges, \ngrapefruits, lemons. Now see the big pile of yellow  lemons. \nThere's a cutting board and a knife next to them. T ake one of \nthose big yellow lemons and cut it in half. Smell t hat citrus smell! \nIt's really juicy, and there's lemon juice tricklin g onto \nthe board. Now take a half lemon and cut that in half, \nso you have a quarter lemon wedge in your hands. \nOK, now—remember how you did this as a kid?—\nput that quarter of a lemon in your mouth and bite \ninto it! Scrunch! \nIf you played along with me, you probably \nnoticed that  the  saliva  content  in your  mouth \nincreased at least a bit. Your body was actually tr ying to process \ncitric acid! And it was just in your mind. \n240 Bright people have \nthe capability of \nfreaking out faster \nand more \ndramatically than \nanyone else. \nCHAPTER 12  I THE POWER OF THE NEXT-ACTION DECISION \nIf your body responds to the pictures you give it, how are you \nlikely to feel physically when you think about, say , doing your \ntaxes? Are you sending yourself \"easy,\" \"let's go,\"  completion, suc- \ncess, and \"I'm a winner!\" pictures? Probably not. F or just that rea- \nson, what kinds of people would logically be the mo st resistant to \nbeing reminded about a project like that—that is, w ho would pro- \ncrastinate the most? Of course, it would be the mos t creative, \nsensitive, and intelligent people!

There \nalways seem to be hobgoblin thoughts lurking inside  them—\n\"If \nwe don't look at or think about the projects, maybe\nthey'll stay quiet!\" \nSo what's the solution? There's always having a \ndrink. Numb it out. Dumb it down. Notice what \nhappens to many people when they get a little alco-\nhol on the brain. It should drop their energy imme-\ndiately, because it's a depressant; often, though, the energy lifts, at \nleast initially. Why? The alcohol is depressing something—it's \nshutting down the negative self-talk and uncomforta ble visions \nthat are going on in these folks' minds. Of course my energy will \nincrease if I stop depressing myself with overwhelm ing pictures of \nnot handling something successfully. But the numb-o ut solutions \nare temporary at best. The \"stuff\" doesn't go away.  And unfortu- \nnately, when we numb ourselves out, we can't do it selectively—\nthe source of inspiration and enthusiasm and person al energy also \nseems to get numbed. \nIntelligent Dumbing Down \nThere is another solution: intelligently dumbing do wn your brain \nby figuring out the next action. You'll invariably feel a relieving of \npressure about anything you have a commitment to ch ange or do, \nwhen you decide on the very next physical action re quired to \nmove it forward. Nothing, essentially, will change in \nthe world. But shifting your focus to something tha t \nyour mind perceives as a doable, completeable task \nwill create a real increase in positive energy, dir ection, \nand motivation. If you truly captured all the thing s \nthat have your attention during the mind-sweep, go \nthrough the list again now and decide on the single\nvery next action to take on every one of them. Noti ce \nwhat happens to your energy. \nYou are either attracted or repelled by the things \non your lists; there isn't any neutral territory. Y ou are \n242 Ceasing negative \nimaging will always \ncause your energy \nto increase. \nNo matter how big \nand tough a \nproblem may be, \nget rid of confusion \nby taking one little \nstep toward \nsolution. Do \nsomething. \n—George \nF. \nCHAPTER 12  I  THE POWER OF THE NEXT-ACTION DECISION \neither positively drawn toward completing the actio n or reluctant \nto think about what it is and resistant to getting involved in it. \nOften it's simply the next-action decision that mak es the differ- \nence between the two extremes. \nIn following up with people who have taken my \nseminars or been coached by my colleagues or me, \nI've discovered that one of the subtler ways many o f \nthem fall off the wagon is in letting their action lists \ngrow back into lists of tasks or subprojects instea d of \ndiscrete next actions. They're still ahead of most peo- \nple because they're actually writing things down, b ut \nthey often find themselves stuck, and procrastinat-\ning, because they've allowed their action lists to har- \nbor items like: \n\"Meeting with the banquet committee\" \n\"Johnny's birthday\" \n\"Receptionist\" \n\"Slide presentation\" \nIn other words, things have morphed back into \"stuf f-ness \ninstead of staying at the action level. There are n o clear next \nactions here, and anyone keeping a list filled with  items like this \nwould send his or her brain into overload every tim e he/she \nlooked at it. \nIs this extra work? Is figuring out the next \naction on your commitments additional effort to \nexpend that you don't need to? No, of course not.

It changed their culture perman ently and \nsignificantly for the better. \nWhy?

I've learned the \nhard way that no matter where we are in the convers ation, twenty \nminutes before the agreed end-time of the discussio n I must force \nthe question: \"So what's the next action here?\" In my experience, \nthere is usually twenty minutes' worth of clarifyin g (and some- \ntimes tough decisions) still required to come up wi th an answer. \nThis is radical common sense—radical because it oft en \ncom- \npels discussion at deeper levels than people are co mfortable with. \n\"Are we serious about this?\" \"Do we really know wha t we're doing \nhere?\" \"Are we really ready to allocate precious ti me and resources \nto this?\" It's very easy to avoid these more releva nt levels of think- \ning. What prevents those issues from slipping away into amor- \nphous \"stuff\" is forcing the decision about the nex t action. Some \nfurther conversation, exploration, deliberation, an d negotiation \nare often needed to put the topic to rest. The worl d is too unpre- \ndictable these days to permit assumptions about out - \ncomes: we need to take responsibility for moving \nthings to clarity. \nYou have to have some experience of this to \nreally know what I mean here.

But in the world of knowledge \nwork, all the computers and telecom improvements \nand leadership seminars on the planet will make no \ndifference in this regard unless the individuals in volved increase \ntheir operational responsiveness. And that requires  thinking \nabout something that lands in your world before you have to. \nOne of the biggest productivity leaks I have seen i n some \norganizations is the lack of next actions determine d for \"long- \nterm\" projects. \"Long-term\" does not mean \"Someday/ Maybe.\" \n246 There are risks and \ncosts to a program \nof action, but they \nare far less than \nthe long-range '\nrisks and costs of \ncomfortable \ninaction. \n—John \nF. \nCHAPTER 12  I  THE POWER OF THE NEXT-ACTION DECISION \nThose projects with distant goal lines are still to  be \ndone as soon as possible; \"long-term\" simply means,\n\"more action steps until it's done,\" not \"no need t o \ndecide next actions because the day of reckoning is  so \nfar away.\" When every project and open loop in an \norganization is being monitored, it's a whole new b all \ngame. \nEmpowerment \nPerhaps the greatest benefit of adopting the next- \naction approach is that it dramatically increases y our \nability to make things happen, with a concomitant r ise in your \nself-esteem and constructive outlook. \nPeople are constantly doing things, but usually onl y when \nthey have to, under fire from themselves or others.  They get no \nsense of winning, or of being in control, or of coo perating among \nthemselves and with their world. People are starvin g for those \nexperiences. \nThe daily behaviors that define the things that are  incom- \nplete and the moves that are needed to complete the m must \nchange. Getting things going of your own accord, be fore you're \nforced to by external pressure and internal stress,  builds a firm \nfoundation of self-worth that will spread into ever y aspect of your \nlife. You are the captain of your own ship; the mor e you act from \nthat perspective, the better things will go for you . \nAsking \"What's the next action?\" undermines the vic tim \nmentality. It presupposes that there is a possibili ty of change, and \nthat there is something you can do to make it happe n. That is the \nassumed affirmation in the behavior. And these kind s of \"assumed \naffirmations\" often work more fundamentally to buil d a positive \nself-image than can repeating \"I am a powerful, eff ective person, \nmaking things happen in my life!\" a thousand times.\nIs there too much complaining in your culture? The next \ntime someone moans about something, try asking, \"So  what's the \nnext action?\" People will complain only about somet hing that \n247 Productivity will\nimprove only when \nindividuals increase \ntheir operational\nresponsiveness.\nAnd in knowledge \nwork, that means \nclarifying actions on \nthe front end \ninstead of the back.\nTHE POWER OF THE KEY PRINCIPLES |  PART THREE \nthey assume could be better than it currently is.
