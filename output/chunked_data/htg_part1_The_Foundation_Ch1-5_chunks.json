TQ waste \nyour time is to waste your life, but to master your time is to \nmaster your life and make the most of it. \nAs a Time Planning and Life Goals Consultant, I have \ncreated a new system which is helping millions of people \nright now to determine the best use of their time—and so \ngain control of their lives. \nI'm not a \"time and motion\" organizer, trying to get every­\nthing done in the shortest time with the fewest wasted mo­\ntions. That kind of efficiency means taking the thinking out \nof an activity and reducing it to a series of mechanical \nroutines.

If you follow my suggestions, you'll proba­\nbly find yourself thinking more about how you really want to \nuse your time, working less hard, doing more of the things \nyou've always wanted to do, and enjoying your life a lot \nmore. \nSo please don't call me an efficiency expert.

At the same time, I will help \nyou to eliminate procrastination and maintain the momentum \nyou need to get the job done. \nIn this book you'll learn about the experiences of my \nclients, my family and myself in applying my techniques. And \nyou'll see that my system is not inflexible, mechanical or bur­\ndensome. Far from it! It's fun to learn and fun to experiment \nwith. The benefits come immediately, and then continue to \ngrow. \nMy system for effective time use has worked successfully \nfor such corporate clients as A.T. & T., Bank of America, \nI.B.M., Lever Brothers, and Standard Oil Company of Cali­\nfornia; for numerous local and federal agencies; for such \nbusy people as recording star Neil Diamond; feminist and \nwriter Gloria Steinem; designer Milton Glaser; Mike \nMcCloskey, Executive Director of the Sierra Club; William \nBall, General Director of the American Conservatory The­\natre; Mike Murphy, Esalen Institute president; Michael But­\nler, producer of \"Hair;\" and for thousands of executives, pro­\nfessionals, entrepreneurs, homemakers, students, and others \nwho consult me during my seminars or on an individual basis. \nI feel strongly about the value of my system because it has \ngiven me control of my own life. The system can also work \nsuccessfully for your life and what you want to get out of it. \nI'm not necessarily trying to show you how to become pres­\nident of your company or how to juggle simultaneous careers \nas office worker and mother. With my system, you can \nachieve such goals—if they really are your goals. But you \ncan also become a more effective college student, chess \nplayer, candlemaker or international playboy. It's entirely up \nto you. \nAnd please remember: There is no such thing as lack of \ntime. We all have plenty of time to do everything we really \nwant to do. If, like so many people, you're \"too busy\" to get \nthings done, keep in mind that there are plenty of people \nwho are even busier than you are who manage to get more \ndone than you do. They don't have more time than you have. \nThey just use their time to better advantage! Effective time \nuse—like driving a car—is a skill that can be acquired, and \nin this book I have assembled all the tools you'll need.

If you hold the fist tight for \neven a few minutes, your hand will ache with the effort. Such \na tensed, strained fist has few (peaceful) uses. \nNext drop your hand to your side. Keep all your muscles \nas loose as possible. You can't get much productive work out \nof your hand in that position, either. \nNow raise your hand slowly in front of you and make it \ncome alive. Gradually move the fingers and feel the muscles \nrespond with good tone and control. Here is a hand that can \nget something done! \nThe kind of control I am recommending is in many ways \nanalogous to good muscle tone. It is the sort of control over \nyour time (and your life) that is neither too tight (i.e., com­\npulsive, restrained, obsessive) nor too loose (i.e., apathetic, \nindifferent, lazy). This kind of control will help you get \nthings done and also allows you to be flexible and spontane­\nous. \nThe ideal is balance. \nBeware the Time Not \nThe purpose of this book is emphatically not to turn you \ninto a compulsive clockwatcher, or into someone who is con­\nstantly busy or aggressively efficient. To be more specific, \nhere are three notorious characters that neither I nor any­\nbody else enjoys having around: \nThe overorganized person is always making lists, updating \nlists, losing lists. When asked to do something, he tends to \n14 \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 15 \nspend much time considering every possibility, planning every \ndetail, making sure that he has every base covered. He \ndoesn't move without first planning the smallest detail, and \nconsequently he often doesn't even get around to doing many \nthings he should. He is more interested in feeling organized in \nhis head than in accomplishing anything. If he doesn't get \naround to doing what he planned today—well, he'll just make \na better plan tomorrow. He's so intent on being well-orga­\nnized that he's often blind to changes, new opportunities, and \nthe needs of others. \nThe overdoer is so busy doing things that he has no time \nto assess their true value. He is a hard person to approach, \neven with a time-saving idea. He's generally disliked because \nhe tells everyone else what to do. He lacks spontaneity and \nflexibility. He's terribly efficient, but as often as not is eagerly \nclambering up the wrong tree. With every minute of his time, \nboth at home and at work, filled with activity, he never has a \nmoment to relax. \nThe time nut is overwhelmingly preoccupied with time. He \nmakes himself and everyone else nervous with his concern \nabout never wasting a minute. He's always rushing around to \nmeet an impossible schedule. If a meeting starts even a min­\nute late, he frets and fumes. He keeps careful records in \ngreat detail of what he does every day. He knows how to \nsave eleven seconds eating his cereal! Not an easy person to \nwork or live with. \nIf you think that trying to \"get control\" of your time and \nyour life means becoming super-organized, super-busy, or \npreoccupied with every moment as it slips by, let me assure \nyou that this is not the case. Each of the three types sketched \nabove has taken a potentially valuable trait and turned it into \na liability. Each is as badly off as the person who's totally \ndisorganized, never does what he says he is going to do, \nnever plans ahead, or goes through life from one crisis to an­\nother. \nNeither extreme is desirable. Too much organization is as \nineffective as too little. But there is no right answer. Different \npeople require varying degrees of structure and spontaneity \n",

After \nfourteen years in the auto industry, Mr. Williams was con­\nsidering changing careers. His advancement had been good, \nbut not as good as he had hoped. He found his job as pro­\nduction manager for a Kalamazoo assembly plant only mod­\nerately interesting. He was bored with Kalamazoo, and \nthought that living in Chicago would be more exciting. \nMr. Williams was tempted to make a change. But which? \nShould he use his production-management experience to \nchange industries? Should he seek a production job in Chi­\ncago or some other large city? Should he move first, then find \na new job? How should he go about looking? Or should he \nforget all about production and study to become a real-estate \nsalesman? With so many different options, his final decision is \nnot at all clear-cut. \nLike Ms. Kay and Mr. Williams, you and everybody else \nare faced with all kinds of decisions, some hard and some \neasy, some large and some small—every day. \nWho Can Do It All? \nWould you like to be a doctor, lawyer, Indian chief, musi­\ncian, architect, artisan, baseball player? Would you like to \n18 \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LD7E 19 \ntravel to Europe, South America, Nigeria, Timbuktu? It's not \njust a matter of talent and money. Even an Einstein or an \nOnassis can't do everything there is to do and see everything \nthere is to see in the world. Decisions, decisions, decisions \nsurround us all, clamoring for attention. \nHow about today? Will you work, go to a show, read a \nbook, visit friends, sleep late, play bridge? Your time is lim­\nited, but your imagination isn't.

Face it. Sometimes \nyou've got to do what others want you to do. But not always 1 \nDoing What You Want To Do \nIn discussing her son's future with friends, Mrs. Reed was \nquite emphatic about the best use of her son's time. After \nJack graduated from high school he would go to college at \nhis parents' alma mater. Jack had other ideas. He was tired \nof school, had doubts about the usefulness of formal educa­\ntion, and felt that the best use of his time would be to travel \nfor a year or two. \nWhat is the best use of Jack's time? The answer isn't clear, \nalthough certainly Mrs. Reed and Jack each have rather \nstrong opinions on the subject. \nWho is the decisionmaker? Jack is. Mrs. Reed may claim \nto have the right to decide, but even if Jack does go on to \ncollege (if only to please his mother), he has decided. \nSituations in which you feel other people are making your \ndecisions for you are not uncommon. A parent, a child, a \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 21 \nspouse, a boss, a friend may seem to have as much say about \nhow you spend your time as you yourself do—and sometimes \nmore. \nThat feeling may be understandable, but the fact is other­\nwise. Ultimately, another person can only recommend what \nyou ought to do—you and you alone make the final decision. \nYou either accept or reject the recommendation. Of course, \nsome decisions involve painful consequences. Your boss wants \nyou to work on a certain project but you have your own \nideas about what you should be doing with your time. If you \ncontinue to press your position, you may find yourself with­\nout a job. But in many situations the element of free choice \nis quite large indeed. \nTrue enough, it may sometimes seem that you have little \nfree choice. It is foolish to deny that age, education, back­\nground, economic status, sex, and race impose real limits on \nus all. So let's recognize at the outset that in everyone's situa­\ntion there are uncontrollable elements. It saves a great deal \nof time to make a realistic assessment of what these are, and \nthen accept them.

Rational, emotional, and physical \nneeds must all be satisfied, but cannot always be satisfied at \nthe same time. Sometimes they have to fight it out. Work or \nplay golf? Read your book or play with your child? Have a \nsecond cup of coffee at lunch or go back to the office? How \nto decide? \nMr. Smith knew that the use of a dictating machine would \nsave him time, but he hated talking to a blank wall. Should \nhe listen to his rational part and save time, or to his emo­\ntional part and dictate to his secretary? Mr. Smith thought he \nhad solved the problem by putting a picture of his secretary \non his desk when he dictated. This gave him the feeling he \nwas talking to a real person who would transcribe his dicta­\ntion. Everything worked fine until one day his wife visited his \noffice to pick him up for dinner and discovered his secretary's \npicture on his desk. You can imagine the price Mr. Smith \nhad to pay when he picked himself and the broken picture up \noff the floor. Perhaps Mr. Smith would have done better to \nput a picture of his wife and family on his desk to remind \nhim where the money he earned went. \nAnother kind of conflict makes it hard to choose: long-\nterm vs. short-term goals. Should you cook tonight's dinner \nor get ready for a weekend dinner party? Water the lawn or \nread your gardening books? \nMr. Martin had a large backlog of work. To catch up he \nneeded at least a month, yet management demanded there be \nno more than a week's backlog. Mr. Martin had figured out a \nTO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 23 \nprocedure that would cut the processing time of each Hem in \nhalf, but his new system would take at least two months to \nimplement. \nShould Mr. Martin tell everyone who knocked on his door \nfor their order to come back in two months? This would give \nhim the time he needed to implement the new procedure. But \nthe back-order situation would be approaching chaos. \nOr should Mr. Martin keep struggling to get out the work \nas best he can, keeping at least some people happy as their \nfinished work comes off the production line each day? True, \nit would take him longer to fill each back order, but that was \nthe way it had always been done. And he would be showing \ndaily progress on the backlog, something he couldn't do if he \ndevoted his energies to instituting the new procedure. \nShould Mr. Martin emphasize the short term, and keep \nsome work coming out daily—or the long term, and revise \nthe procedure? Whatever he does, he's going to make some \npeople unhappy. If he takes the short-term route, he loses \nlong-term benefits. If he chooses the long-term route, he \ngives up short-term value. In a situation like this he might \nput the decision up to his boss; or decide to take either ex­\ntreme; or devise some middle-of-the-road compromise, get­\nting out some work daily but also moving the new procedure \nahead a little each day.

You suddenly decide you want to \ngo to a show that evening, phone the Andersons to join you, \nbut find they are already engaged, so you settle for going \nwith another couple you don't like nearly as well. \n5) Default. You wait for other couples to invite you out, \nand therefore spend most of your time either at home or \namong people you might not prefer. \n6) Conscious Decision. You sit down with your husband, \nlay out a program of inviting over new acquaintances with \nwhom you have a lot in common and old friends you haven't \nseen often enough lately. \nSpur of the moment decisions can be fine. Nor is there \nanything \"wrong\" with decisions that come about by default, \nthe demands of others, escapism or habit. But if you are not \nsatisfied with the payoff from those decisions, more conscious \nefforts are called for. How tempting it is in difficult situations \nto drift, dream or drown. But is that really what you want to \ndo? There is an alternative. You can drift, dream or \ndrown—or you can decide. \n4. CONTROL STARTS \nWITH PLANNING \n\"I feel like I waste so much of my time doing things \nthat are not really important to me, while my life is \nslipping away.\" \nMI have so much to do; there's just not enough time for \nme to do it all.\" \n\"I'm harassed, overworked, tired, tense. I seem to be \nforever pushing myself, and can't ever relax com­\npletely.\" \nTHIS IS WHAT I often hear from people who talk with me \nabout their time problems. Behind each statement is a wish \nthat things could somehow be different: \"If only I could get \non top of the situation.\" \"If only I could be more like so-and-\nso, who seems to have time to do everything and still man­\nages to be relaxed and happy.\" \"If only I could do what I \nreally want to do.\" \"If only I were in controll\" \nControl starts with planning. \nPlanning is bringing the future into the present so that you \ncan do something about it now. \nEveryone makes plans: what movie to see tomorrow night, \nwhich friends to visit next weekend, where to vacation next \nsummer, big plans and little plans, realistic plans and far­\nfetched plans, playful plans and serious plans. \nMost people plan rather haphazardly. They usually do it \nonly when they feel forced to. Perhaps you feel overwhelmed \nby the work you have to do and this forces you to plan your \nday. Or you have a large block of uncommitted vacation \ntime and you want to use it in a satisfying way. This kind of \noccasional, special-purpose planning is a valuable tool indeed, \nbut it does have limitations. If you only plan this way you \nrun the risk of not planning when you really most need to. \nI have never known anyone who was hurt by too much of \nthe kind of planning I am going to recommend. I have \n25 \n26 ALAN LAKEIN \nknown many people who have suffered from failure to plan \nadequately. \nLearning From Professionals \nConsider the difference between an amateur and a profes­\nsional photographer. The person who uses his camera occa­\nsionally to capture a birthday party, a scenic view, or a \nfamily outing will snap a few pictures of the cherished mo­\nment, eagerly await the outcome, then, often as not, feel dis­\nappointed with the results. Out of a dozen or so pictures, \nseveral will come out blurred, one will include only a part of \nsomeone's head, another will capture a frown rather than a \nsmile. He will rightly conclude he is not a good photogra­\npher. \nThe professional photographer proceeds quite differently. \nHe shoots several rolls of film. When these are developed he \nstudies the results, and discovers more bad shots than our \namateur did. But because he has taken so many shots, he sees \nsome that he is quite pleased with. \nThen he goes into the darkroom and considers what he can \ndo to improve the good shots.

What begins as a fuzzy, ill-\ndefined jungle of conflicts gradually comes into focus. A wild \nshot that does not really represent a desired goal gets weeded \nout. The more important aspects of the plan are refined and \nelaborated on so that more and more meaning is built into \nthem. \nHe checks as the days go by to see how he is following \nthrough on his plans. He looks for problems, false assump­\ntions, hang-ups, and difficulties, and makes corrections where \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 27 \nhe has to. Like our professional photographer, he makes \nsome readjustments and becomes better and better at what \nhe does. \nA banker I know has his work time under control and now \nspends more time with his family on his boat. By planning his \ntime carefully he's found it easier to take on new projects \nand adapt his day-to-day routine to fit his long-term plans. \nHe is a good time planner not because he started out that \nway but because he put time and effort into refining his plan. \nDo You Know How You \nSet Yoor Priorities Now? \nPlanning and making choices are often hard work. They \ninvolve careful thinking and decision-making. They also force \nyou to recognize what criteria you use in setting priorities. \nThe wife of a very talented filmmaker said during our con­\nsulting session that she felt she was wasting her time. Her cri­\nteria in setting time priorities, it turned out, revolved around \nher family's needs, when what she really wanted to do was \nstructure her time in terms of her own needs. She came to \nrealize that once she took care of her own time needs she \nwould feel more comfortable coping with the needs of her \nfamily. \nDifferent criteria may result in different priorities and \ncause a conflict of interests. However, if you're aware of this, \nas the filmmaker's wife was after our consultation, you'll be \nbetter equipped to deal with the conflict. For instance, a \nteacher may be studying for an advanced degree at night. \nShe cares about her students, but she also wants to better her \nprofessional standing. When she comes home from her own \nclasses at the university, should she work on grading her \nthird-graders' compositions or drag out that Comparative Lit \npaper she's been writing? If her criterion is her own students' \nneeds, then she grades the compositions, but if her criterion is \nher own advancement, then a better use of her time is to \nwork on that Comparative Lit. paper. Her choice depends on \nher priorities; whatever she decides, proper planning will en­\nable her to recognize that she should settle the conflict be­\ntween her own needs and those of her students. \nMany people seem to have difficulty planning because they \nregard it only as \"thinking\"—which aU too often translates \n28 ALAN LAKE IN \ninto either \"staring into space\" or \"daydreaming.\" They need \na way to make a more concrete task out of planning. From \nexperience with thousands of people I have concluded that it \nis much better to conceive of planning as \"writing\" than as \n\"thinking.\" \nThe following chapters contain a number of exercises, and \nI'll ask you to write the answers to some questions. Writing \nthe answers down will reduce your tendency to daydream, \nand also help you make better decisions. I call the time when \nyou plan \"Decision Time,\" because that's what planning is all \nabout—making decisions as to what and when and, if neces­\nsary, how. \nIn all planning, long-range, middle-range, or short-range, \nyou (1) make a list, and (2) set priorities. All the items on a \nlist are not of equal value. Once you have made a list, set \npriorities based on what is important to you now. In my \nopinion, no list is complete until it shows priorities. Whenever \nyou make a list, finish the list by setting priorities. \nIt's as Basic as ABC \nUse the ABC Priority System: write a capital letter \"A\" to \nthe left of those items on the list that have a high value; a \n\"B\" for those with medium value; and a \"C\" for those with \nlow value. As you do this, you know that to some extent \nyou're guessing. You're not sure you'll be right on the value. \nBut comparing the items to one",

You're not sure you'll be right on the value. \nBut comparing the items to one another will help you come \nup with the ABC priority choices for every entry on the list. \nItems marked A should be those that yield the most value. \nYou get the most out of your time by doing the A's first, and \nsaving the B's and C's for later. Taking account of the time \nof day and the urgency of the items, you can break them \ndown further so that A-items become A-l, A-2, A-3, A-4. \nABC's are relative, depending on your point of view \n(remember, you are the decisionmaker). A task might be an \nA-priority while you're thinking of all the rewards that come \nwhen it is done. But halfway through, when the going gets \nrough and you don't like the discomfort involved in sticking \nto it, you drop it in the middle. Was it an A or not? Even so, \nif you doubt your judgment, whose is better? I say you are \nthe best judge of your own priorities, and if you are not satis-\nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 2* \nfied with the way things come out you need to improve your \nability to focus on what you really consider important. \nThe ABC's are also relative depending on what's on your \nlist. The A's generally stand out clearly in contrast to the less \nimportant B's and Cs. In a work of art, attention-getters in­\ncluding vivid colors and foreground details stand out from \nthe background and catch the eye first Your A-items should \nbe the attention-getters on your list. \nABC's may change over time. Today's A may become to­\nmorrow's C, while today's C becomes tomorrow's A. You \nneed to set priorities continually, considering the best use of \nyour time right now. \nABC's may further vary depending on the amount of time \nyou decide to invest in a particular project. You could proba­\nbly satisfy the boss with about two hours' work on the report \nhe wanted (you feel it's a C), impress him with about four \nhours (now it's a B), and make a lot of points if you \nbroadened the question under study and devoted ten hours to \nsolving the more general case (you've made it an A). \nA few minutes worrying about Bobby's poor grades might \nhelp you come up with some good ideas to improve them, \nbut it would be a waste of time to spend too long on it with­\nout getting some feedback from Bobby and perhaps his \nteacher. \nWhile spending an hour a day playing with your youngster \nmay be an A, spending six hours to the neglect of your hus­\nband and house can at best be a B, and spending every min­\nute of the waking day amusing him so that neither the \nyoungster nor you sees anyone else is certainly a C. \nObviously, it's not worthwhile to make a big effort for a \ntask of little value. On the other hand, a project with high \nvalue can be worth a great deal of effort. Only good planning \nwill let you reap maximum benefits from minimum time in \nvestments. \n5. WHAT DO YOU REALLY \nWANT FROM LIFE? \nWhat are your lifetimes goals? \nHow would you like to spend the next three years? \nIf you knew now you would be struck by lightning six \nmonths from today, how would you live until then? \nIT MAY SEEM TRITE to say so, but perhaps you've never \nstopped to take stock. The basic resource that each person \nstarts with is his lifetime—all the minutes, hours, days, and \nyears that he is alive. It's only within this total framework \nthat good time planning is possible. Which is why I recom­\nmend you start by defining your lifetime goals. \nI'll soon get down to your minute-by-minute problems of \ntoday. But right now a written Lifetime Goals Statement will \nhelp you discover what you really want to do, help motivate \nyou to do it and give meaning to the way you spend your \ntime. It will give a direction to your life. It will help you feel \nin control of your destiny. And it will provide a measuring \nstick against which to gauge alternate activities as they come \nalong. You'll be better able to balance the many aspects of \nyour life. And you'll reduce unnecessary conflict over how to \nuse your time. \nA Lifetime Goals Statement is neither magic nor a cosmic \nexercise in clairvoyance. There's really very little involved in \ngetting one down on paper. Some people do feel a bit uneasy",

There's really very little involved in \ngetting one down on paper. Some people do feel a bit uneasy \nabout it. They feel it's overwhelming. They claim it's embar­\nrassing. Or they feel that a written plan will permit their op­\ntions and take some of the creativity and spontaneity and fun \nout of their lives. Let me assure you nothing could be further \nfrom the truth. Over 15,000 people in my seminars and con­\nsultations have composed Lifetime Goals Statements and I \nbelieve each one has come away with a clearer picture of \njust what he wanted to do with his life. Few of them had \n30 \nTO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 31 \n'tten down their lifetime goals before they came to my sem-\nSo let me put the question to you: What are your lifetime \nals? \nIn one way or another, whether you have been explicitly \naware of it or not, you have been thinking about your life­\ntime goals almost as long as you have been alive. However, \nthinking about your goals is usually quite a different experi­\nence from writing them down. Unwritten goals often remain \nvague or Utopian dreams, such as \"travel,\" or \"becoming a \nmillionaire.\" Writing goals down tends to make them more \nconcrete and specific and helps you probe below the surface \nof the same old cliches you've been telling yourself for years. \nYou can gain a valuable new perspective by seeing your \nlong-familiar thoughts committed to paper, because you can \nthen examine them more closely. Once they have an indepen­\ndent identity, you can scrutinize them better. They can be an­\nalyzed, refined, changed, updated, and pondered. \nAlso, you most likely will discover goals that are important \nto you even though you never verbalized them or took them \nseriously before. This happens because writing requires you \nto be more specific; aims get narrowed down, because you \ncan't write very many words compared to the millions you \nhave thought in your lifetime. In fact, your selection of what \nyou write down indicates priorities that might surprise you. \nIf you have never tried writing down your lifetime goals, \nthe following exercise will help you get started. If you have a \ngoals list already, you may find it helpful to update your \nthoughts using this exercise. \nYour Lifetime Goals Exercise \nGet several pieces of paper, a pencil or pen, and a watch \nor clock with a second hand, and set aside about fifteen min­\nutes. Write at the__top of a sheet of paper the question, What \nare my lifetime goals? \n(In identifying lifetime goals you should recognize that you \nwould get different answers at ages five, twenty-five, and \nsixty-five. So you should interpret your lifetime goals as the \ngoals that represent the way you see your life starting from \nright now and from the perspective you have today.) \n32 ALAN LAKE IN \nNow, take exactly two minutes to list answers to the ques­\ntion on your paper. Of necessity, you will have to stay very \ngeneral and abstract, but you should still have time to take \naccount of personal, family, social, career, financial, commu­\nnity, and spiritual goals. Try to make your list as all-inclusive \nas you can. Try to get as many words down in the two \nminutes as possible. During this listing stage you are not \ncommitted to any of the goals that you write down, so \nrecord whatever comes into your head. \nDon't be afraid to include such far-out wishes as climbing \nthe Matterhorn, going to a group-sex party, eating a whole \ncheesecake, taking the year off, building a retirement home in \nItaly, chartering a yacht, adopting triplets, losing forty \npounds by jogging an hour a day. There's nothing wrong with \nuncensored fantasies. \nAfter the first two minutes are up, give yourself an addi­\ntional two minutes to make any changes necessary for you to \nfeel satisfied with your statement of goals at this early gen­\neral level. \nYou might identify one or two additional lifetime goals by \nlooking for implicit trends in your current pattern of living. \nFor example, if you diligently read books while commuting \non the bus, you may have an unspoken goal of continuing \nyour education. Regular reading of the newspaper may sug­\ngest goals of keeping informed and entertained. You'll have a \nchance to decide later whether or not these are really signifi­\ncant lifetime goals. \nThe Second Lifetime Question \nWhen you list lifetime goals quickly and without much re­\nflection, you probably include a number of generalities",

You can pin-point your \ngoals better by now asking a second question How would I \nlike to spend the next three years? (If you are over thirty, \nchange the \"three\" to \"five\" years.) Again list your answers \nas quickly as you can for two minutes, then take another two \nminutes to include whatever you may have missed the first \ntime around on this question. \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 33 \nThe Third Lifetime Question \nNow, for a different perspective, write down this third \nquestion: // / knew now I would be struck dead by lightning \nsix months from today, how would I live until then? (This \nmeans that you'd have only six months to live and would \nhave to squeeze whatever you consider important into your \ndramatically reduced time on earth. Before you start listing, \nassume that everything relating to your death has been attend­\ned to. You have completed your will, bought a cemetery \nplot, and the like. Your answer to the question should con­\ncern itself with how you would live these last six months.) \nThe purpose of this question is to find out whether there \nare things that are important to you that you're not doing \nnow or which deserve more of your attention in the next six \nmonths. You might continue to live as you do now; or, if you \nhad the money, you might want to quit your job and live it \nup for the last six months. What would you do? Write your \nanswers as quickly as possible for two minutes, then go back \nand improve them for an additional two minutes. (Don't get \nlost in thinking about this question—just write.) \nIf you have read to this point without writing answers to \nthe three lifetime goals questions, I urge you to go back and \ndo it now. This is an important exercise, and doing it will re­\nally benefit you. % \nWorking Further On All Three Questions \nNow spend an additional two minutes minimum reviewing \nand improving your goals statements in answering all three \nquestions. You may spend longer if you wish. \nIn looking over all three sets of answers you may have \nfound that the answers to question 2 were an extension of \nquestion 1, and this is desirable. Some people also find ques­\ntion 3 (the six-months question) a continuation of the previ­\nous two, but others are jarred into sharp departures from \ntheir previous plans because of the sudden realization that \ntheir time is limited. \nFor instance, I probably wouldn't quit my work and travel \n34 ALAN LAKE IN \naround the world. I would try to do as much time-manage­\nment consulting as I could, and I'd definitely take off more \ntime, but basically I wouldn't change very much because I'm \nhappy in what I'm doing. \nSomeone else may say, \"OK, I'm going to stop where I am \nand I'm going to eat, drink, and be merry because I'm going \nto die in six months. I'll travel around the world, I'll use up \nall my money, I'll do all the things I've always wanted to \ndo.\" There's no one \"right\" answer. The choice is up to the \nindividual. \nFor those who are happy doing what they are doing, the \nsix-months question represents an affirmation; they'll con­\ntinue along as they are. \nFor those who come up with a completely different set of \nthings to do, some real changes may well be in order. They \nshouldn't put in good time after bad. The six-months question \nwill help identify some things they would do if forced by cir­\ncumstance to take stock of their lives. The point is: With \nproper time management, there's no real reason why they \nshouldn't start doing most of their preferred activities today. \nNow you have a list of goals. But you have probably \nthought of more to do than there is time to do it in. This \nlack of time creates goal conflicts. \nConflicts among various goals on your list need not neces­\nsarily be disturbing. A goal to spend more time advancing \nyour career may conflict with a goal to spend more time with \nyour family. This competition for your attention can stimu­\nlate you to increase the quality of the time you spend on \neach. If, on the other hand, these goal conflicts cause you to \nfeel frustrated, then a",

If, on the other hand, these goal conflicts cause you to \nfeel frustrated, then a good use of your time would be to try \nto resolve such conflicts. \nHow to Resolve Goal Conflicts \nGoal conflicts are resolved by setting priorities. You must \ndecide which goals are most important to you at this time. \nSome conflicts will seem to take care of themselves when \nthey are put down on paper. If an individual finds that he \ndoesn't assign a high value to what he had long thought he \nmost wanted to do, then chances are he really knew all along \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 35 \nthat other goals had higher priority. He simply hadn't faced \nthe reality before. \nOther conflicts are much more difficult to resolve. If you \nare faced with a painful choice between two opposing goals, \nkeep in mind that priorities can later be adjusted and re­\nadjusted ad infinitum. Your goals are written on paper—not \ncarved on marble tablets. \nIf you are reluctant to set a higher priority for one goal \n(say, going back to school) and hence a lower priority for \nanother (family time), you could consider each equally im­\nportant. If you then allocate more hours to one than to the \nother, you can still tell yourself that they are equally impor­\ntant. Even if they are mutually contradictory, or need to be \ndone-in the same time period, you can console yourself by \ntelling yourself that you're giving up one—but only for right \nnow. Next week or next year you will give the other goal its \nturn. \nThere is no other way. You must face up to the challenge \nof deciding what is important to you now by setting priori­\nties. Here is how to sort things out, using the three lists you \nhave already prepared. \nHow to Set Lifetime Priorities \nTake your Lifetime Goals list in hand and spend one min­\nute selecting your top three goals. Label the most important \nof these A-l. The second most important is A-2. The third is \nA-3. Do the same for your three-years list, and your six-\nmonths list. \nAt this point you have nine goals culled from the three \nlists. To pick out the three most important long-term goals of \nthe nine, write on a fresh piece of paper, \"My three most im­\nportant long-term goals are. . . .\" Then write them in order: \nA-l, A-2, A-3. You have now finished a preliminary Lifetime \nGoals Statement. You have zeroed in on just what it is you \nwant to do with your life as you see it at this time. \nWhen I work with individual clients I spend a lot of time \nhelping them refine their Lifetime Goals Statements. We \nmight go through six or seven drafts over a period of two \nweeks before we come up with a statement that represents \n36 ALAN LAKE IN \nthe client's true preferences. You too will find it helpful to at­\ntempt refinements of the statement several times. \nJust as a photographer may shoot and reshoot the same \nscene to get the desired effect, your Lifetime Goals Statement \nwill benefit from successive \"shots.\" So tomorrow repeat the \nGoals exercise and compare the results. You won't get pre­\ncisely the same answers, and the odds are you'll come up \nwith additional information that you didn't include the first \ntime around. That's just the way the human mind works. \nSince the Lifetime Goals Statement is not static, it should \nbe revised periodically. A good time every year to reevaluate \nyour statement is on your birthday. Even if you snapped the \nperfect picture last year, this year you are different and last \nyear's picture is not an adequate representation of how you \nsee things. Your lifetime goals statement should grow as you \ngrow.",

If, on the other hand, these goal conflicts cause you to \nfeel frustrated, then a good use of your time would be to try \nto resolve such conflicts. \nHow to Resolve Goal Conflicts \nGoal conflicts are resolved by setting priorities. You must \ndecide which goals are most important to you at this time. \nSome conflicts will seem to take care of themselves when \nthey are put down on paper. If an individual finds that he \ndoesn't assign a high value to what he had long thought he \nmost wanted to do, then chances are he really knew all along \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 35 \nthat other goals had higher priority. He simply hadn't faced \nthe reality before. \nOther conflicts are much more difficult to resolve. If you \nare faced with a painful choice between two opposing goals, \nkeep in mind that priorities can later be adjusted and re­\nadjusted ad infinitum. Your goals are written on paper—not \ncarved on marble tablets. \nIf you are reluctant to set a higher priority for one goal \n(say, going",

If you then allocate more hours to one than to the \nother, you can still tell yourself that they are equally impor­\ntant.
