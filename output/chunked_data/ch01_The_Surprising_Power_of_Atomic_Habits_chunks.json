The\norganization, which was the governing body for\nprofessional cycling in Great Britain, had recently hired\nDave Brailsford as its new performance director . At the\ntime, professional cyclists in Great Britain had endured\nnearly one hundred years of mediocrity . Since 1908, British\nriders had won just a single gold medal at the Olympic\nGames, and they had fared even worse in cycling’s biggest\nrace, the T our de France. In 110 years, no British cyclist\nhad ever won the event.\nIn fact, the performance of British riders had been so\nunderwhelming that one of the top bike manufacturers in\nEurope refused to sell bikes to the team because they were\nafraid that it would hurt sales if other professionals saw the\nBrits using their gear .\nBrailsford had been hired to put British Cycling on a new\ntrajectory . What made him diﬀerent from previous coaches\nwas his relentless commitment to a strategy that he\nreferred to as “the aggregation of marginal gains,” which\nwas the philosophy of searching for a tiny margin of\nimprovement in everything you do . Brailsford said, “ The\nwhole principle came from the idea that if you broke down\neverything you could think of that goes into riding a bike,\nand then improve it by 1 percent, you will get a signiﬁcant\nincrease when you put them all together .”\nBrailsford and his coaches began by making small\nadjustments you might expect from a professional cycling\nteam. They redesigned the bike seats to make them more\ncomfortable and rubbed alcohol on the tires for a better\ngrip. They asked riders to wear electrically heated\novershorts to maintain ideal muscle temperature while\nriding and used biofeedback sensors to monitor how each\nathlete responded to a particular workout. The team tested\nvarious fabrics in a wind tunnel and had their outdoor\nriders switch to indoor racing suits, which proved to be\nlighter and more aerodynamic.\nBut they didn’t stop there. Brailsford and his team\ncontinued to ﬁnd 1 percent improvements in overlooked\nand unexpected areas. They tested diﬀerent types of\nmassage gels to see which one led to the fastest muscle\nrecovery . They hired a surgeon to teach each rider the best\nway to wash their hands to reduce the chances of catching\na cold. They determined the type of pillow and mattress\nthat led to the best night’s sleep for each rider . They even\npainted the inside of the team truck white, which helped\nthem spot little bits of dust that would normally slip by\nunnoticed but could degrade the performance of the ﬁnely\ntuned bikes.\nAs these and hundreds of other small improvements\naccumulated, the results came faster than anyone could\nhave imagined.\nJust ﬁve years after Brailsford took over , the British\nCycling team dominated the road and track cycling events\nat the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, where they won an\nastounding 60 percent of the gold medals available. F our\nyears later , when the Olympic Games came to London, the\nBrits raised the bar as they set nine Olympic records and\nseven world records.\nThat same year , Bradley W iggins became the ﬁrst British\ncyclist to win the T our de France. The next year , his\nteammate Chris Froome won the race, and he would go on\nto win again in 2015, 2016, and 2017, giving the British\nteam ﬁve T our de France victories in six years.\nDuring the ten-year span from 2007 to 2017, British\ncyclists won 178 world championships and sixty-six\nOlympic or P aralympic gold medals and captured ﬁve T our\nde France victories in what is widely regarded as the most\nsuccessful run in cycling history .*\nHow does this happen? How does a team of previously\nordinary athletes transform into world champions with tiny\nchanges that, at ﬁrst glance, would seem to make a modest\ndiﬀerence at best? Why do small improvements accumulate\ninto such remarkable results, and how can you replicate\nthis approach in your own life?\nWHY SMALL HABITS MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE\nIt is so easy to overestimate the importance of one deﬁning\nmoment and underestimate the value of making small\nimprovements on a daily basis. T oo often, we convince\nourselves that massive success requires massive action.\nWhether it is losing weight, building a business, writing a\nbook, winning a championship, or achieving any other goal,\nwe put pressure on ourselves to make some earth-\nshattering improvement that",

The\ndiﬀerence a tiny improvement can make over time is\nastounding. Here’s how the math works out: if you can get\n1 percent better each day for one year , you’ll end up thirty-\nseven times better by the time you’re done. Conversely , if\nyou get 1 percent worse each day for one year , you’ll\ndecline nearly down to zero . What starts as a small win or a\nminor setback accumulates into something much more.\n1% BET TER EVER Y DAY\n1% worse every day for one year . 0.99365 = 00.03\n1% better every day for one year . 1.01365 = 37.78\nFIGURE 1:  The eﬀects of small habits compound over time. F or\nexample, if you can get just 1 per cent better each day, you’ll\nend up with r esults that ar e nearly 37 times better af ter one\nyear.\nHabits are the compound interest of self -improvement.\nThe same way that money multiplies through compound\ninterest, the eﬀects of your habits multiply as you repeat\nthem. They seem to make little diﬀerence on any given day\nand yet the impact they deliver over the months and years\ncan be enormous. It is only when looking back two, ﬁve, or\nperhaps ten years later that the value of good habits and\nthe cost of bad ones becomes strikingly apparent.\nThis can be a diﬀicult concept to appreciate in daily life.\nWe often dismiss small changes because they don’t seem to\nmatter very much in the moment. If you save a little money\nnow, you’re still not a millionaire. If you go to the gym three\ndays in a row , you’re still out of shape. If you study\nMandarin for an hour tonight, you still haven’t learned the\nlanguage. W e make a few changes, but the results never\nseem to come quickly and so we slide back into our\nprevious routines.\nUnfortunately , the slow pace of transformation also\nmakes it easy to let a bad habit slide. If you eat an\nunhealthy meal today , the scale doesn’t move much. If you\nwork late tonight and ignore your family , they will forgive\nyou. If you procrastinate and put your project oﬀ until\ntomorrow , there will usually be time to ﬁnish it later . A\nsingle decision is easy to dismiss.\nBut when we repeat 1 percent errors, day after day , by\nreplicating poor decisions, duplicating tiny mistakes, and\nrationalizing little excuses, our small choices compound\ninto toxic results. It’s the accumulation of many missteps—\na 1 percent decline here and there—that eventually leads to\na problem.\nThe impact created by a change in your habits is similar\nto the eﬀect of shifting the route of an airplane by just a\nfew degrees. Imagine you are ﬂying from Los Angeles to\nNew Y ork City . If a pilot leaving from LAX adjusts the\nheading just 3.5 degrees south, you will land in\nWashington, D .C., instead of New Y ork. Such a small\nchange is barely noticeable at takeoﬀ—the nose of the\nairplane moves just a few feet—but when magniﬁed across\nthe entire United States, you end up hundreds of miles\napart. *\nSimilarly , a slight change in your daily habits can guide\nyour life to a very diﬀerent destination. Making a choice\nthat is 1 percent better or 1 percent worse seems\ninsigniﬁcant in the moment, but over the span of moments\nthat make up a lifetime these choices determine the\ndiﬀerence between who you are and who you could be.\nSuccess is the product of daily habits—not once-in-a-\nlifetime transformations.\nThat said, it doesn’t matter how successful or\nunsuccessful you are right now . What matters is whether\nyour habits are putting you on the path toward success. Y ou\nshould be far more concerned with your current trajectory\nthan with your current results. If you’re a millionaire but\nyou spend more than you earn each month, then you’re on\na bad trajectory . If your spending habits don’t change, it’s\nnot going",

Conversely , if you’re broke, but you\nsave a little bit every month, then you’re on the path\ntoward ﬁnancial freedom—even if you’re moving slower\nthan you’d like.\nYour outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits.\nYour net worth is a lagging measure of your ﬁnancial\nhabits. Y our weight is a lagging measure of your eating\nhabits. Y our knowledge is a lagging measure of your\nlearning habits. Y our clutter is a lagging measure of your\ncleaning habits. Y ou get what you repeat.\nIf you want to predict where you’ll end up in life, all you\nhave to do is follow the curve of tiny gains or tiny losses,\nand see how your daily choices will compound ten or\ntwenty years down the line. Are you spending less than you\nearn each month? Are you making it into the gym each\nweek? Are you reading books and learning something new\neach day? Tiny battles like these are the ones that will\ndeﬁne your future self .\nTime magniﬁes the margin between success and failure.\nIt will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time\nyour ally . Bad habits make time your enemy .\nHabits are a double-edged sword. Bad habits can cut you\ndown just as easily as good habits can build you up, which\nis why understanding the details is crucial. Y ou need to\nknow how habits work and how to design them to your\nliking, so you can avoid the dangerous half of the blade.\nYOUR HABITS CAN COMPOUND FOR Y OU OR AGAINST Y OU\nPositive Compounding\nProductivity compounds. Accomplishing one e xtra task is a small feat on\nany given day, but it counts for a lot over an entir e car eer. The eﬀect of\nautomating an old task or mastering a new skill can be even gr eater . The mor e\ntasks you can handle without thinking, the mor e your brain is fr ee to focus on\nother ar eas.\nKnowledge compounds. Learning one new idea won’t mak e you a genius,\nbut a commitment to lifelong lear ning can be transfor mative. F urther more,\neach book you r ead not only teaches you something new but also opens up\ndiﬀer ent ways of thinking about old ideas. As W arren Buﬀett says, “That’s how\nknowledge works. It builds up, lik e compound inter est.”\nRelationships compound. People r eﬂect your behavior back to you. The\nmore you help others, the mor e others want to help you. Being a little bit nicer\nin each interaction can r esult in a network of br oad and str ong connections\nover time.\nNegative Compounding\nStress compounds.  The frustration of a traﬃc jam. The weight of par enting\nresponsibilities. The wor ry of making ends meet. The strain of slightly high\nblood pr essur e. By themselves, these common causes of str ess ar e\nmanageable. But when they persist for years, little str esses compound into\nserious health issues.\nNegative thoughts compound. The mor e you think of yourself as worthless,\nstupid, or ugly, the mor e you condition yourself to interpr et life that way . You\nget trapped in a thought loop. The same is true for how you think about others.\nOnce you fall into the habit of seeing people as angry, unjust, or selﬁsh, you\nsee those kind of people everywher e.\nOutrage compounds. Riots, pr otests, and mass movements ar e rarely the\nresult of a single event. Instead, a long series of micr oaggr essions and daily\naggravations slowly multiply until one event tips the scales and outrage\nspreads lik e wildﬁr e.\nWHA T PROGRES S IS REALL Y LIKE\nImagine that you have an ice cube sitting on the table in\nfront of you. The room is cold and you can see your breath.\nIt is currently twenty-ﬁve degrees. Ever so slowly , the room\nbegins to heat up.\nTwenty-six degrees.\nTwenty-seven.\nTwenty-eight.\nThe ice cube is still sitting on the table in front of you.\nTwenty-nine degrees.\nThirty .\nThirty-one.\nStill, nothing has happened.\nThen, thirty-two degrees. The ice begins to melt. A one-\ndegree shift, seemingly no diﬀerent from the temperature\nincreases before it, has unlocked a huge change.\nBreakthrough moments",

A one-\ndegree shift, seemingly no diﬀerent from the temperature\nincreases before it, has unlocked a huge change.\nBreakthrough moments are often the result of many\nprevious actions, which build up the potential required to\nunleash a major change. This pattern shows up\neverywhere. Cancer spends 80 percent of its life\nundetectable, then takes over the body in months. Bamboo\ncan barely be seen for the ﬁrst ﬁve years as it builds\nextensive root systems underground before exploding\nninety feet into the air within six weeks.\nSimilarly , habits often appear to make no diﬀerence until\nyou cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of\nperformance. In the early and middle stages of any quest,\nthere is often a V alley of Disappointment. Y ou expect to\nmake progress in a linear fashion and it’s frustrating how\nineﬀective changes can seem during the ﬁrst days, weeks,\nand even months. It doesn’t feel like you are going\nanywhere. It’s a hallmark of any compounding process: the\nmost powerful outcomes are delayed.\nThis is one of the core reasons why it is so hard to build\nhabits that last. P eople make a few small changes, fail to\nsee a tangible result, and decide to stop. Y ou think, “I’ve\nbeen running every day for a month, so why can’t I see any\nchange in my body?” Once this kind of thinking takes over ,\nit’s easy to let good habits fall by the wayside. But in order\nto make a meaningful diﬀerence, habits need to persist\nlong enough to break through this plateau—what I call the\nPlateau of Latent P otential .\nIf you ﬁnd yourself struggling to build a good habit or\nbreak a bad one, it is not because you have lost your ability\nto improve. It is often because you have not yet crossed the\nPlateau of Latent P otential. Complaining about not\nachieving success despite working hard is like complaining\nabout an ice cube not melting when you heated it from\ntwenty-ﬁve to thirty-one degrees. Y our work was not\nwasted; it is just being stored. All the action happens at\nthirty-two degrees.\nWhen you ﬁnally break through the Plateau of Latent\nPotential, people will call it an overnight success. The\noutside world only sees the most dramatic event rather\nthan all that preceded it. But you know that it’s the work\nyou did long ago—when it seemed that you weren’t making\nany progress—that makes the jump today possible.\nIt is the human equivalent of geological pressure. T wo\ntectonic plates can grind against one another for millions of\nyears, the tension slowly building all the while. Then, one\nday, they rub each other once again, in the same fashion\nthey have for ages, but this time the tension is too great. An\nearthquake erupts. Change can take years—before it\nhappens all at once.\nMastery requires patience. The San Antonio Spurs, one\nof the most successful teams in NBA history , have a quote\nfrom social reformer Jacob Riis hanging in their locker\nroom: “ When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a\nstonecutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps a\nhundred times without as much as a crack showing in it.\nYet at the hundred and ﬁrst blow it will split in two, and I\nknow it was not that last blow that did it—but all that had\ngone before.”\nTHE PLA TEAU OF LA TENT POTENTIAL\nFIGURE 2:  We often e xpect pr ogress to be linear . At the very\nleast, we hope it will come quickly . In reality, the r esults of our\neﬀorts ar e often delayed. It is not until months or years later\nthat we r ealize the true value of the pr evious work we have\ndone. This can r esult in a “ valley of disappointment” wher e\npeople feel discouraged af ter putting in weeks or months of har d\nwork without e xperiencing any r esults. However, this work was\nnot wasted. It was simply being stor ed. It is not until much later\nthat the full value of pr evious eﬀorts is r evealed.\nAll big things come from small beginnings. The seed of\nevery habit is a single, tiny decision. But as that decision is\nrepeated, a habit sprouts and grows stronger . Roots\nentrench themselves and branches grow . The task of\nbreaking a bad habit is like uprooting a",

Each one was a goal to be reached. I set goals for the\ngrades I wanted to get in school, for the weights I wanted\nto lift in the gym, for the proﬁts I wanted to earn in\nbusiness. I succeeded at a few , but I failed at a lot of them.\nEventually , I began to realize that my results had very little\nto do with the goals I set and nearly everything to do with\nthe systems I followed.\nWhat’s the diﬀerence between systems and goals? It’s a\ndistinction I ﬁrst learned from Scott Adams, the cartoonist\nbehind the Dilbert  comic. Goals are about the results you\nwant to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead\nto those results.\nIf you’re a coach, your goal might be to win a\nchampionship. Y our system is the way you recruit\nplayers, manage your assistant coaches, and conduct\npractice.\nIf you’re an entrepreneur , your goal might be to build a\nmillion-dollar business. Y our system is how you test\nproduct ideas, hire employees, and run marketing\ncampaigns.\nIf you’re a musician, your goal might be to play a new\npiece. Y our system is how often you practice, how you\nbreak down and tackle diﬀicult measures, and your\nmethod for receiving feedback from your instructor .\nNow for the interesting question: If you completely\nignored your goals and focused only on your system, would\nyou still succeed? F or example, if you were a basketball\ncoach and you ignored your goal to win a championship\nand focused only on what your team does at practice each\nday, would you still get results?\nI think you would.\nThe goal in any sport is to ﬁnish with the best score, but\nit would be ridiculous to spend the whole game staring at\nthe scoreboard. The only way to actually win is to get\nbetter each day . In the words of three-time Super Bowl\nwinner Bill W alsh, “The score takes care of itself .” The\nsame is true for other areas of life. If you want better\nresults, then forget about setting goals. F ocus on your\nsystem instead.\nWhat do I mean by this? Are goals completely useless?\nOf course not. Goals are good for setting a direction, but\nsystems are best for making progress. A handful of\nproblems arise when you spend too much time thinking\nabout your goals and not enough time designing your\nsystems.\nProblem #1: W inners and losers have the same goals.\nGoal setting suﬀers from a serious case of survivorship\nbias. W e concentrate on the people who end up winning—\nthe survivors—and mistakenly assume that ambitious goals\nled to their success while overlooking all of the people who\nhad the same objective but didn’t succeed.\nEvery Olympian wants to win a gold medal. Every\ncandidate wants to get the job. And if successful and\nunsuccessful people share the same goals, then the goal\ncannot be what diﬀerentiates the winners from the losers.\nIt wasn’t the goal of winning the T our de France that\npropelled the British cyclists to the top of the sport.\nPresumably , they had wanted to win the race every year\nbefore—just like every other professional team. The goal\nhad always been there. It was only when they implemented\na system  of continuous small improvements that they\nachieved a diﬀerent outcome.\nProblem #2: A chieving a goal is only a momentary change.\nImagine you have a messy room and you set a goal to clean\nit. If you summon the energy to tidy up, then you will have\na clean room—for now . But if you maintain the same sloppy ,\npack -rat",

When\nyou fall in love with the process rather than the product,\nyou don’t have to wait to give yourself permission to be\nhappy . You can be satisﬁed anytime your system is running.\nAnd a system can be successful in many diﬀerent forms,\nnot just the one you ﬁrst envision.\nProblem #4: Goals ar e at odds with long-ter m progress.\nFinally , a goal-oriented mind-set can create a “yo-yo” eﬀect.\nMany runners work hard for months, but as soon as they\ncross the ﬁnish line, they stop training. The race is no\nlonger there to motivate them. When all of your hard work\nis focused on a particular goal, what is left to push you\nforward after you achieve it? This is why many people ﬁnd\nthemselves reverting to their old habits after accomplishing\na goal.\nThe purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The\npurpose of building systems is to continue playing the\ngame. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not\nabout any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of\nendless reﬁnement and continuous improvement.\nUltimately , it is your commitment to the process  that will\ndetermine your progress .\nA SYSTEM OF A TOMIC HABITS\nIf you’re having trouble changing your habits, the problem\nisn’t you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat\nthemselves again and again not because you don’t want to\nchange, but because you have the wrong system for\nchange.\nYou do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the\nlevel of your systems.\nFocusing on the overall system, rather than a single goal,\nis one of the core themes of this book. It is also one of the\ndeeper meanings behind the word atomic . By now , you’ve\nprobably realized that an atomic habit refers to a tiny\nchange, a marginal gain, a 1 percent improvement. But\natomic habits are not just any old habits, however small.\nThey are little habits that are part of a larger system. Just\nas atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic\nhabits are the building blocks of remarkable results.\nHabits are like the atoms of our lives. Each one is a\nfundamental unit that contributes to your overall\nimprovement. A t ﬁrst, these tiny routines seem\ninsigniﬁcant, but soon they build on each other and fuel\nbigger wins that multiply to a degree that far outweighs the\ncost of their initial investment. They are both small and\nmighty .",
