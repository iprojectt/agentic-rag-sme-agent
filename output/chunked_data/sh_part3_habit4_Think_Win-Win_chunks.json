I know if \nthey would cooperate, we could produce so much mo re.  Can you help us develop a human-relations \nprogram that will solve the problem?\"    \"Is your problem the people or the paradigm?\" I asked.    \"Look for yourself,\" he replied.    So I did.  And I found that there was a real se lfishness, and unwillingness to cooperate, a resistance \nto authority, defensive communication.  I could see that overdrawn Emotional Bank Accounts had \ncreated a culture of low trust.  But I pressed the question.    \"Let's look at it deeper,\" I suggested.  \"Why don't your people cooperate? What is the reward for \nnot cooperating?\"    \"There's no reward for not cooperating,\" he assu red me.  \"The rewards are much greater if they do \ncooperate.    \"Are they?\" I asked.  Behind a curtain on one wall of this man's office was a chart.  On the chart \nwere a number of racehorses all lined up on a track.  Superimposed on  the face of each horse was the \nface of one of his managers.

And the habit of effect ive interpersonal leadership is Think Win-Win. \n Six Paradigms of Human Interaction     Win-win is not a technique; it 's a total philosophy of human interac tion.  In fact, it is one of six \nparadigms of interaction.  The alternative paradig ms are win-lose, lose-win, lose-lose, win, and \nWin-Win or No Deal TM  Win-Win     Win-win is a frame of mind and heart that consta ntly seeks mutual benefit in all human interactions.  \nWin-win means that agreements or solutions are mu tually beneficial, mutually satisfying.  With a \nwin-win solution, all parties feel good about the de cision and feel committed to the action plan.  \nWin-win sees life as a cooperative, not a competitiv e arena.  Most people tend to think in terms of \ndichotomies: strong or weak, hardball or softball,  w i n  o r  l o s e .   B u t  t h a t  k i n d  o f  t h i n k i n g  i f  \nfundamentally flawed.  It's based on power and posi tion rather than on princi ple.  Win-win is based \non the paradigm that there is plenty for everybody, that one person's success is not achieved at the \nexpense or exclusion of the success of others.    Win-win is a belief in the Third Alternative.  It's  not your way or my way; it's a better way, a higher \nway.  Win-Lose     One alternative to win-win is win-lose, the paradig m of the race to Bermuda.  It says \"If I win, you \nlose.    In leadership style, win-lose is the authoritari an approach: \"I get my way; you don't get yours.\"  \nWin-lose people are prone to use position, power, cr edentials, possessions, or personality to get their \nway.    Most people have been deeply scripted in th e win-lose mentality since birth.  First and most \nimportant of the powerful forces at work is the family.  When one child is  compared with another -- \nwhen patience, understanding or love is given or wi thdrawn on the basis of such comparisons -- people \nare into win-lose thinking.  Whenever love is give n on a conditional basis, when someone has to earn \nlove, what's being communicated to them is that they  are not intrinsically valuable or lovable.  Value \ndoes not lie inside them, it lies outside.  It's in comparison with somebody else or against some \nexpectation.  \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n   And what happens to a youn g mind and heart, highly vulnerab le, highly dependent upon the \nsupport and emotional affirmation of the parents, in the face of conditional love?

I must not be as valuable.\" \n   Another powerful scripting agen cy is the peer group.  A child first wants acceptance from his \nparents and then from his peers, whether they be siblings or friends.  And we all know how cruel \npeers sometimes can be.  They often accept or reje ct totally on the basis of conformity to their  \nexpectations and norms, providing additional scripting toward win-lose.

The \"normal distribution curve\" basically says \nthat you got an \"A\" because someone else got a \"C.\"  It interprets an indivi dual's value by comparing \nhim or her to everyone else.  No recognition is gi ven to intrinsic value; everyone is extrinsically \ndefined.    \"Oh, how nice to see you here at our PTA meeting.   You ought to be really proud of your daughter, \nCaroline.  She's in the upper 10 percent.\"    \"That makes me feel good.\"    \"But your son, Johnny, is in trouble.  He's in the lower quartile.\"    \"Really? Oh, that's terrible! What can we do about it?\"    What this kind of comparative information does n't tell you is that perhap s Johnny is going on all \neight cylinders while Caroline is coas ting on four of her eight.  But people are not graded against their \npotential or against the full use of their present capaci ty.  They are graded in relation to other people.  \nAnd grades are carriers of social value; they op en doors of opportunity or they close them.  \nCompetition, not cooperation, lies at the core of the educational process.  Cooperation, in fact, is usually associated with cheating.    Another powerful programming ag ent is athletics, particularly for young men in their high school or \ncollege years.  Often they develop the basic paradig m that life is a big game , a zero sum game where \nsome win and some lose.  \"Winning\" is \"beating\" in the athletic arena.    Another agent is law.  We live in a litigious so ciety.  The first thing many people think about when \nthey get into trouble is suing someone, taking him to  court, \"winning\" at someone else's expense.  But \ndefensive minds are neither creative nor cooperative.    Certainly we need law or else society will deterio rate.  It provides survival, but it doesn't create \nsynergy.

They love their weaknesses \n-- they take advantage of them.  Such weaknesses complement their strengths.    But the problem is that lose-win people bury a lot of feelings.  And unexpressed feelings never die; \nthey're buried alive and come fo rth in uglier ways.  Psychosomatic illnesses, particularly of the \nrespiratory, nervous, and circulatory systems ofte n are the reincarnation of cumulative resentment, \ndeep disappointment, and disillusionment repressed by  the lose-win mentality.  Disproportionate rage \nor anger, overreaction to minor provocation, an d cynicism are other embodiments of suppressed \nemotion.    People who are constantly repressing, not transcend ing, feelings towards a higher meaning find that \nit affects the quality of their self-esteem and eventu ally the quality of their relationships with others. \n   Both win-lose and lose-win are weak positions, based in personal insecurities.  In the short run, \nwin-lose will produce more results because it draws on the often considerable strengths and talents of \nthe people at the top.  Lose-win is weak and chaotic from the outset. \n   Many executives, managers, and parents swing back  and forth, as if on a pendulum, from win-lose \ninconsideration to lose-win indulg ence.  When they can't stand co nfusion and lack of structure, \ndirection, expectation, and discipline any longer, they  swing back to win-lose -- until guilt undermines \ntheir resolve and drives them back to lose-win -- until anger and frust ration drive them back to win-lose \nagain.  Lose-Lose     When two win-lose people get together -- that  is, when two determined , stubborn, ego-invested \nindividuals interact -- the result will be lose-lose.  Both will lose.  Both will become vindictive and \nwant to \"get back\" or \"get even,\" blind to the fact that murder is suicide, that revenge is a two-edged \nsword.    I know of a divorce in which the husband was dire cted by the judge to sell the assets and turn over \nhalf the proceeds to his ex-wife.  In compliance, he sold a car worth over $10,000 for $50 and gave $25 \nto the wife.  When the wife protested, the court cl erk checked on the situation and discovered that the \nhusband was proceeding in the same manner sy stematically through all of the assets. \n   Some people become so centered on an enemy,  so totally obsessed with the behavior of another \nperson that they become blind to everything except thei r desire for that person to  lose, even if it means \nlosing themselves.  Lose-lose is the philosophy  of adversarial conflict, the philosophy of war. \n   Lose-lose is also the philosophy of the highly  dependent person without inner direction who is \nmiserable and thinks everyone else should be, too.  \"If nobody ever wins, perh aps being a loser isn't so \nbad.

If you value a relationship and the issue isn't rea lly that important, you may want to go for lose-win \nin some circumstances to genuinely affirm the other person.  \"What I want isn't as important to me as \nmy relationship with you.  Let's do it your way this  time.\"  You might also go for lose-win if you feel \nthe expense of time and effort to achieve a win of any kind would violate other higher values.  Maybe \nit just isn't worth it.    There are circumstances in which you would want  to win, and you wouldn 't be highly concerned \nwith the relationship of that win to others.  If yo ur child's life were in danger, for example, you might \nbe peripherally concerned about other people and circumstances.  But saving that life would be \nsupremely important.    The best choice, then, depends on reality.  The ch allenge is to read that reality accurately and not to \ntranslate win-lose or other scripting into every situation.    Most situations, in fact, are part of an interdep endent reality, and then wi n-win is really the only \nviable alternative of the five.    Win-lose is not viable because, although I appe ar to win in a confrontation with you, your feelings, \nyour attitudes toward me and our relationship have b een affected.  If I am a supplier to your company, \nfor example, and I win on my terms in a particular negotiation, I may get what I want now.  But will \nyou come to me again?  My short-term win will real ly be a long-term lose if I don't get your repeat \nbusiness.  So an interdependent win-lose  is really lose-lose in the long run. \n   If we come up with a lose-win, you may appe ar to get what you want for the moment.  But how \nwill that affect my attitude about working with you,  about fulfilling the contrac t?  I may not feel as \nanxious to please you.  I may carry battle scars wi th me into any future negotiations.  My attitude \nabout you and your company may be spread as I associ ate with others in the in dustry.  So we're into \nlose-lose again.  Lose-lose obviou sly isn't viable in any context. \n   And if I focus on my own win and don't even co nsider your point of view,  there's no basis for any \nkind of productive relationship.    In the long run, if it isn't a win for both of us , we both lose.  That's why win-win is the only real \nalternative in interdependent realities.    I worked with a client once, the president of a large chain of retail stores, who said, \"Stephen, this \nwin-win idea sounds good, but it is so idealistic.  The tough, realistic business world isn't like that.  \nThere's win-lose everywhere, and if you're not out there playing the game, you just can't make it.\" \n   \"All right,\" I said, \"try going for win-lose  with your customers.  Is that realistic?\" \n   \"Well, no,\" he replied.    \"Why not?\" \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n   \"I'd lose my customers.\" \n   \"Then, go for lose-win -- give the store away.  Is that realistic?\"    \"No.  No margin, no mission.\"    As we considered the various alternatives, win-win appeared to be the only truly realistic approach.    \"I guess that's true with customers, \" he admitted, \"but not with suppliers.\" \n   \"You are the customer of the supplier,\" I said.  \"Why doesn't the same principle apply?\" \n   \"Well, we recently renegotiated our lease agreem ents with the mall operators and owners,\" he said.  \n\"We went in with a win-win attitude.  We were op en, reasonable, conciliatory.  But they saw that \nposition as being soft and weak, an d they took us to the cleaners.\" \n   \"Well, why did you go for lose-win?\" I asked.    \"We didn't.

And as \nwe examined the long-term impact of  that lose-win, the suppressed f eelings, the trampled values, the \nresentment that seethed under the surface of the relati onship, we agreed that it was really a loss for both \nparties in the end.    If this man had had a real win-win attitude, he would have stayed longer in the communication \nprocess, listened to the mall owner more, then expre ssed his point of view with more courage.  He \nwould have continued in the win-win spirit until a so lution was reached and they both felt good about \nit.  And that solution, that Third Alternative, would have b een synergistic -- probably something \nneither of them had thought of on his own.  Win-Win or No Deal TM     If these individuals had not come up with a syne rgistic solution -- one that  was agreeable to both -- \nthey could have gone for an even higher ex pression of win-win, Win-Win or No Deal. \n   No deal basically means that if we can't find a solution that would benefit us both, we agree to \ndisagree agreeably -- no deal.  No expectations have been created, no performance contracts established.  I don't hire you or we don't take on a particular assignment together because it's obvious \nthat our values or our goals are going in opposite di rections.  It is so much better to realize this up \nfront instead of downstream when expectations have been created and bo th parties have been \ndisillusioned.    When you have no deal as an option in your mind, you feel liberated beca use you have no need to \nmanipulate people, to push your own agenda, to drive for what you want.  You can be open.  You can \nreally try to understand the deeper issues underlying the positions.    With no deal as an option, you can honestly say, \"I only want to go for win-win.  I want to win, and I want you to win.  I wouldn't want to get my way and have you not feel good about it, because \ndownstream it would eventually surface and create  a withdrawal.  On the other hand, I don't think \nyou would feel good if you got your way and I gave in.  So let's work for a win-win.  Let's really \nhammer it out.  And if we can't find it, then let's agree that we won't ma ke a deal at all.  It would be \nbetter not to deal than to live with a decision that wasn't right for us both.  Then maybe another time \nwe might be able to get together.\" \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n   Some time after learning the concept of Win-Win or No Deal, th e president of a small computer \nsoftware company shared with me the following experience: \n   \"We had developed new software which we sold on a five-year contract to a particular bank.  The \nbank president was excited about it, but his people weren't really behind the decision.    \"About a month later, that bank  changed presidents.  The new presid ent came to me and said, 'I am \nuncomfortable with these software conversions.  I have a mess on my hands.  My people are all \nsaying that they can't go through this and I really feel I just can't push it at this point in time.' \n   \"My own company was in deep financial trouble.  I knew I had every legal right to enforce the contract.  But I had become convinced of the value of the principle of win-win.    \"So I told him 'We have a contract.  Your bank has secured our products and our services to convert \nyou to this program.  But we understand that you're not happy about it.  So what we'd like to do is \ngive you back the contract, give you back your depo sit, and if  you are ever looking for a software \nsolution in the future, come back and see us.' \n   \"I literally walked away from an $",

The cost of the impact  needs to be carefully considered.  If  you can't \nreach a true win-win, you're very often better off to go for no deal.    Win-Win or No Deal provides tremendous emotio nal freedom in the family relationship.  If family \nmembers can't agree on a video that everyone will enjoy,  they can simply decide to do something else -- \nno deal -- rather than having some enjo y the evening at the expense of others. \n   I have a friend whose family has been involved  in singing together for several years.  When they \nwere young, she arranged the music, made the costumes, accompanied th em on the piano, and directed \nthe performances.    As the children grew older, their taste in music be gan to change and they wanted to have more say \nin what they performed and what they wore.  They became less responsive to direction. \n   Because she had years of experience in performing  herself and felt closer to the needs of the older \npeople at the rest homes where they planned to perf orm, she didn't feel that  many of the ideas they \nwere suggesting would be appropriate.  At the sa me time, however, she recognized their need to \nexpress themselves and to be part of the decision-making process.    So she set up a Win-Win or No Deal.  She told  them she wanted to arrive at an agreement that \neveryone felt good about -- or they would simply fi nd other ways to enjoy their talents.  As a result, \neveryone felt free to express his or her feelings  and ideas as they worked to set up a Win-Win \nAgreement, knowing that whether or not they could agree, there would be no emotional strings. \n   The Win-Win or No Deal approach is most realis tic at the beginning of a business relationship or \nenterprise.  In a continuing business relationship, no  deal may not be a viable option, which can create \nserious problems, especially for family businesses or businesses that are begun initially on the basis of \nfriendship.    In an effort to preserve th e relationship, people sometimes go on for years making one compromise \nafter another, thinking win-lose or lose-win even wh ile talking win-win.  This creates serious problems \nfor the people and for the business, particularly if the competition operates on win-win and synergy. \n   Without no deal, many such businesses simply dete riorate and either fail or have to be turned over \nto professional managers.  Experience shows that it is often better in setting up a family business or a \nbusiness between friends to acknowle dge the possibility of no deal downstream and to establish some \nkind of buy/sell agreement so that the busine ss can prosper without permanently damaging the \nrelationship. \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n   Of course there are some relationships where no deal is not viable.  I wouldn't abandon my child or \nmy spouse and go for no deal (it would be better, if  necessary, to go for compromise -- a low form of \nwin-win).  But in many cases, it is possible to go  into negotiation with a full Win-Win or No Deal \nattitude.  And the freedom in the attitude is incredible.  Five Dimensions of Win-Win     Think Win-Win is the habit of interpersonal lead ership.  It involves the exercise of each of the \nunique human endowments -- self-awareness, imaginat ion, conscience, and independent will -- in our \nrelationships with others.  It involves mutual  learning, mutual influence, mutual benefits. \n   It takes great courage as well as consideration to  create these mutual bene fits, particularly if we're \ninteracting with others who are deeply scripted in win-los.    That is why this habit involves",

That is why this habit involves principles of  interpersonal leadership.  Effective interpersonal \nleadership requires the vision, the proactive initia tive, and the security, guidance, wisdom, and power \nthat come from principle-ce ntered personal leadership. \n   The principle of win-win is fundamental to succe ss in all our interactions, and  it embraces five \ninterdependent dimensions of life.  It begins wi th character and moves toward relationships, out of \nwhich flow agreements.  It is nurtured in an en vironment where structure and systems are based on \nwin-win.  And it involves process; we cannot achiev e win-win ends with win-lose or lose-win means. \n   The following diagram shows how these five dimensions relate to each other. \n   Now let's consider each of the five dimensions in turn.  Character     Character is the foundation of win-win, and ever ything else builds on that foundation.  There are \nthree character traits essential to the win-win paradigm.    INTEGRITY.  We've already defined integrity as the value we place on ourselves.  Habits 1, 2, and \n3 help us develop and maintain integrity.  As we cl early identify our values and proactively organize \nand execute around those values on a daily basis, we develop self-awareness and independent will by \nmaking and keeping meaningful promises and commitments.    There's no way to go for a win in our own liv es if we don't even know, in a deep sense, what \nconstitutes a win -- what is, in fact, harmonious wi th our innermost values.  And if we can't make and \nkeep commitments to ourselves as well as to others , our commitments become meaningless.  We know \nit; others know it.  They sense duplicity and beco me guarded.  There's no foundation of trust and \nwin-win becomes an ineffective superficial technique.   Integrity is the cornerstone in the foundation. \n   MATURITY.  Maturity is the balance between cou rage and consideration.  If a person can express \nhis feelings and convictions with courage balanced with consideration for the feelings and convictions \nof another person, he is mature , particularly if the issue is ve ry important to both parties. \n   If you examine many of the psychological tests used for hiring, promoting, and training purposes, \nyou will find that they are designed to evaluate th is kind of maturity.  Whether it's called the ego \nstrength/empathy balance, the self confidence /respect for others balance, the concern for \npeople/concern for tasks balance, \"I'm okay, you're okay\" in transact ional analysis language, or 9.1, 1.9, \n5.5, 9.9, in management grid language -- the quality soug ht for is the balance of what I call courage and \nconsideration.    Respect for this quality is deeply ingrained in the theory of human in teraction, management, and \nleadership.  It is a deep embodiment of the P/PC Balance.  While courage may focus on getting the \ngolden egg, consideration deals with the long-term we lfare of the other stakeholders.  The basic task of \nleadership is to increase the standard of living and the quali ty of life for all stakeholders. \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n   Many people think in dichotomies, in either/or terms.  They think if you're nice, you're not tough.  \nBut win-win is nice...and tough.  It's twice as tough as win-lose.  To go for win-win, you not only have \nto be nice, you have to be courageous.  You not only  have to be empathic, you have to be confident.  \nYou not only have to be considerate and sensitive, yo u have to be brave.  To do that, to achieve that \nbalance between courage and consideration, is the essence of real maturity and is fundamental to \nwin-win.    If I'm high on courage and low on consideratio n, how will I think?  Win-lose.  I'll be strong and \nego bound.  I'll have the courage of my convictions, but I won't be very considerate of yours.    To compensate for my lack of internal matu rity and emotional strength, I might borrow strength \nfrom my position and power, or from my",

That is why this habit involves principles of  interpersonal leadership.  Effective interpersonal \nleadership requires the vision, the proactive initia tive, and the security, guidance, wisdom, and power \nthat come from principle-ce ntered personal leadership. \n   The principle of win-win is fundamental to succe ss in all our interactions, and  it embraces five \ninterdependent dimensions of life.  It begins wi th character and moves toward relationships, out of \nwhich flow agreements.  It is nurtured in an en vironment where structure and systems are based on \nwin-win.  And it involves process; we cannot achiev e win-win ends with win-lose or lose-win means. \n   The following diagram shows how these five dimensions relate to each other. \n   Now let's consider each of the five dimensions in turn.

They see life as having only \nso much, as though there were only one pie out ther e.  And if someone were to get a big piece of the \npie, it would mean less for everybody else.  The Sc arcity Mentality is the zero-sum paradigm of life. \n   People with a Scarcity Mentality have a very diffi cult time sharing recognition and credit, power or \nprofit -- even with those who help in the production.  They also have a very hard time being genuinely \nhappy for the successes of other people -- even, and sometimes especially, members of their own family \nor close friends and associates.  It's almost as if  something is being taken from them when someone \nelse receives special recognition or windfall ga in or has remarkable success or achievement. \n   Although they might verbally express happiness for others' success, inwardly they are eating their \nhearts out.  Their sense of worth comes from being compared, and someone else's success, to some degree, means their failure.  Only so many people  can be \"A\" students; only one person can be \n\"number one.\" To \"win\" simply means to \"beat.\"    Often, people with a Scarcity Mentality harbor secret hopes that others might suffer misfortune -- \nnot terrible misfortune, but acceptable misfortune that would keep them \"in their place.\"  They're \nalways comparing, always competing.  They give thei r energies to possessing things or other people in \norder to increase their sense of worth.    They want other people to be the way they want  them to be.  They often want to clone them, and \nthey surround themselves with \"yes\" people -- pe ople who won't challenge them, people who are \nweaker than they.    It's difficult for people with a Scarcity Menta lity to be members of a complementary team.  They \nlook on differences as signs of  insubordination and disloyalty. \n   The Abundance Mentality, on the other hand, flow s out of a deep inner sense of personal worth and \nsecurity.  It is the paradigm that there is plenty out there and enough to spare for everybody.  It \nresults in sharing of prestige, of recognition, of profits, of decision making.  It opens possibilities, \noptions, alternatives, and creativity.    The Abundance Mentality takes the personal joy,  satisfaction, and fulfillment of Habits 1, 2, and 3 \nand turns it outward, appreciating the uniqueness, the inner direction, the proactive nature of others.  \nIt recognizes the unlimited possibilities for positive  interactive growth and de velopment, creating new \nThird Alternatives.    Public Victory does not mean victory over other people.  It means success in effective interaction \nthat brings mutually beneficial results to everyone  involved.  Public Victory means working together, \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \ncommunicating together, making things happen togeth er that even the same people couldn't make \nhappen by working independently.  And Public Vict ory is an outgrowth of the Abundance Mentality \nparadigm.    A character rich in integrity, maturity, and the Abundance Mentality has a genuineness that goes far \nbeyond technique, or lack of it, in human interaction.

The Sc arcity Mentality is the zero-sum paradigm of life. \n   People with a Scarcity Mentality have a very diffi cult time sharing recognition and credit, power or \nprofit -- even with those who help in the production.

S o  I  \nrecommend reading literature, such as the inspiring biography of Anwar Sadat, In Search of Identity, \nand seeing movies like Chariots of Fire or plays like Les Miserables that expose you to models of \nwin-win.    But remember: If we search deeply enough with in ourselves -- beyond the scripting, beyond the \nlearned attitudes and behaviors -- the real validation of  win-win, as well as every other correct principle, \nis in our own lives.  Relationships     From the foundation of character, we build and maintain win-win relationships.  The trust, the \nEmotional Bank Account, is the esse nce of win-win.  Without trust, the best we can do is compromise; \nwithout trust, we lack the credibility for open, mutu al learning and communication and real creativity. \n   But if our Emotional Bank Account is high, credib ility is no longer an issue.  Enough deposits have \nbeen made so that you know and I know that we deeply respect each other.  We're focused on the \nissues, not on personalities or positions.    Because we trust each other, we're open.  We put our cards on the table.  Even though we see \nthings differently, I know that you're willing to liste n with respect while I describe the young woman to \nyou, and you know that I'll treat your description of  the old woman with the same respect.  We're both \ncommitted to try to understand each other's point of  view deeply and to work together for the Third \nAlternative, the synergistic solution, that will be a better answer for both of us. \n   A relationship where bank accounts are high and both parties are deeply committed to win-win is \nthe ideal springboard for tremendous synergy (Habit 6).  That relationship neither makes  the issues \nany less real or important, nor elim inates the differences in perspect ive.  But it does eliminate the \nnegative energy normally focused on differences in  personality and position and creates a positive, \ncooperative energy focused on thoroughly understand ing the issue and resolving them in a mutually \nbeneficial way.    But what if that kind of relationship isn't ther e?  What if you have to work out an agreement with \nsomeone who hasn't even heard of win-win and is  deeply scripted in win-lose or some other \nphilosophy?    Dealing with win-lose is the real test of wi n-win.  Rarely is win-win easily achieved in any \ncircumstance.  Deep issues and fundamental differences  have to be dealt with.  But it is much easier \nwhen both parties are aware of and committed to it and where there is a high Emotional Bank Account \nin the relationship.    When you're dealing with a person who is coming  from a paradigm of win-lose, the relationship is \nstill the key.  The place to focus is on your Circle of Influence.  You make deposits into the Emotional \nBank Account through genuine courtesy, respect, an d appreciation for that person and for the other \npoint of view.  You stay longer in the communicat ion process.  You listen more, you listen in greater \ndepth.  You express yourself with greater courage.   You aren't reactive.  You go deeper inside \nyourself for strength of character to be proactive.  You keep hammering it out until the other person \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \nbegins to realize that you genuinely want the resoluti on to be a real win for both of you.  That very \nprocess is a tremendous deposit in the Emotional Bank Account. \n    And the stronger you are -- the more genuine yo ur character, the higher your level of proactivity, \nthe more committed you really are to win-win -- the more powerful your influence will be with that \nother person.  This is the real test of interpersonal leadership.  It goes beyond  transactional leadership \ninto transformational leadership, transforming the individuals involved as well as the relationship. \n   Because win-win is a principle people can validat e in their own lives, you will be able to bring",

It's important to realize that not all decisions need to be win-win, even  when the Emotional Bank \nAccount is high.  Again, the key is the relationship .  If you and I worked to gether, for example, and \nyou were to come to me and say, \"Stephen, I know yo u won't like this decision.

But \nwill you support it?\"    If you had a positive Emotional Bank Account wi th me, of course I'd support it.  I'd hope you were \nright and I was wrong.  I'd work to make your decision work.    But if the Emotional Bank Account weren't there, an d if I were reactive, I wouldn't really support it.  \nI might say I would to your face, but behind your ba ck I wouldn't be very enthusiastic.  I wouldn't \nmake the investment necessary to make it succeed.  \"It didn't work,\" I'd say.  \"So what do you want \nme to do now?\"    If I were overreactive, I might even torpedo your decision and do wh at I could to make sure others \ndid too.  Or I might become \"maliciously obedient \" and do exactly and only what you tell me to do, \naccepting no responsibility for results.    During the five years I lived in Great Britain, I saw that country brought twice to its knees because the train conductors were maliciously obedient in following all the rules and procedures written on \npaper.    An agreement means very little in letter without the character and relationship  base to sustain it in \nspirit.  So we need to approach win-win from a genuin e desire to invest in the relationships that make \nit possible.  Agreements     From relationships flow the agreements that gi ve definition and direction to win-win.  They are \nsometimes called performance agreements or partne rship agreements, or shifting the paradigm of \nproductive interaction from vertical to horizontal, from hovering supervision to self-supervision, from \npositioning to being partners in success.    Win-Win Agreements cover a wide scope of interdependent interaction.  We discussed one \nimportant application when we talked about delegation in the \"Green and Clean\" story in Habit 3.  The \nsame five elements we listed there provide the st ructure for Win-Win Agreements between employers \nand employees, between independent people working to gether on projects, bet ween groups of people \ncooperatively focused on a common objective, bet ween companies and suppliers  -- between any people \nwho need to interact to accomplish.  They create an  effective way to clarify and manage expectations \nbetween people involved in any .interdependent endeavor. \n   Desired results (not methods) iden tify what is to be done and when. \n \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n   Guidelines specify the parameters (principles,  policies, etc.) within which results are to be \naccomplished    Resources identify the human, financial, technical, or organizational support available to help accomplish the results.    Accountability sets up the standards of performance and the time of evaluation.    Consequences specify -- good and bad, natural an d logical -- what does and will happen as a result \nof the evaluation.    These five elements give Win-Win Agreements a life of their own.  A clear mutual understanding \nand agreement up front in these areas creates a st andard against which people can measure their own \nsuccess.    Traditional authoritarian supervision is a win-lose  paradigm.  It's also the result of an overdrawn \nEmotional Bank Account.  If you don't have trust or common vision of desire d results, you tend to \nhover over, check up on, and direct.  Trust isn't there,  so you feel as though you have to control people. \n  ",

Win-Win Management Training     Several years ago, I was indirectly involved in a consulting project with a very large banking \ninstitution that had scores of branches.  They wa nted us to evaluate and improve their management \ntraining program, which was supported by an annual budget of $750,000.  The program involved \nselecting college graduates and putting them th rough twelve two-week assignments in various \ndepartments over a six-month period of time so that  they could get a general sense of the industry.  \nThey spent two week in commercial loans, two weeks in  industrial loans, two weeks in marketing, two \nweek in operations, and so forth.  At the end of th e six-month period, they were assigned as assistant \nmanagers in the various branch banks.    Our assignment was to evaluate the six-month formal training period.  As we began, we discovered \nthat the most difficult part  of the assignment was to get a clear pi cture of the desired results.  We asked \nthe top executives the key hard question: \"What should these people be able to do when they finish the \nprogram?\" And the answers we got were vague and often contradictory.    The training program dealt with methods, not re sults; so we suggested that they set up a pilot \ntraining program based on a different paradigm call ed \"learner-controlled instruction.\"  This was a \nWin-Win Agreement that involved identifying specific  objectives and criteria that would demonstrate \ntheir accomplishment and identifying the guidelines, resources, accoun tability, and consequences that \nwould result when the objectives wer e met.  The consequences in this case were promotion to assistant \nmanager, where they would receive the on-the-job part  of their training, and a significant increase in \nsalary.    We had to really press to get the objectives hammered out.  \"What is it you want them to understand about accounting?  Wh at about marketing?  What abou t real estate loans?\"  And we \nwent down the list.  They finally came up with over 100 objectives, which we simplified, reduced, and \nconsolidated until we came down to 39 specific behavioral objectives with criteria attached to them.    The trainees were highly moti vated by both the oppo rtunity and the increase d salary to meet the \ncriteria as soon as possible.  There was a big win in it for them, and there was also a big win for the \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \ncompany because they would have assistant branch ma nagers who met results-oriented criteria instead \nof just showing up for 12 different activity traps.    So we explained the difference between lear ner-controlled instruction and system-controlled \ninstruction to the trainees.  We ba sically said, \"Here are the objectives  and the criteria.  Here are the \nresources, including learning from each other.  So go to it.  As soon as you meet the criteria, you will \nbe promoted to assistant managers.    They were finished in thr ee and a half weeks.  Shifting th e training paradigm had released \nunbelievable motivation and creativity    As with many Paradigm Shifts, there was resist ance.  Almost all of the top executives simply \nwouldn't believe it.  When they were shown the eviden ce that the criteria had been met, they basically \nsaid, \"These trainees don't have the experience.  Th ey lack the seasoning necessary to give them the \nkind of judgment we want them to have as assistant branch managers.\"    In talking with them later, we found that what  many of them were really saying was, \"We went \nthrough goat week; how come these guys don't have to?\"  But of course they couldn't put it",

In addition, for obvious reasons (including  the $750,000 budget for a six-month program), the \npersonnel department was upset.    So we responded, \"Fair enough.  Let's develop so me more objectives and attach criteria to them.  \nBut let's stay with the paradigm of learner-contr olled instruction.\"  We hammered out eight more \nobjectives with very tough criteria in order to gi ve the executives the assu rance that the people were \nadequately prepared to be assistant branch managers and continue the on-the-job part of the training \nprogram.  After participating in some of the session s where these criteria were developed, several of \nthe executives remarked that if the trainees coul d meet these tough criter ia, they would be better \nprepared than almost any who had gone through the six-month program.    We had prepared the trainees to expect resistance .  We took the additional objectives and criteria \nback to them and said, \"Just as we expected, management wants you to accomplish some additional objectives with even tougher criteria than before.  Th ey have assured us this time that if you meet these \ncriteria, they will make you assistant managers.\"    They went to work in unbelievable ways.

I was able to pass three of them off with \nskills I gained in college; I was able  to get another one out of a book; I learned the fifth one from Tom, \nthe fellow you trained last week.  I only have one criterion left to meet, and I wonder if you or \nsomeone else in the department might be able to spend a few hours with me to show me how.\"  So \nthey spent a half a day in a de partment instead of two weeks. \n   These trainees cooperated with each other, b rainstormed with each other, and they accomplished \nthe additional objectives in a week and a half.  Th e six-month program was reduced to five weeks, and \nthe results were significantly increased.    This kind of thinking can similarly affect every area of organizational life if  people have the courage \nto explore their paradigms and to concentrate on wi n-win.  I am always amazed at the results that \nhappen, both to individuals and to organizations , when responsible, proactive, self-directing \nindividuals are turned loose on a task.  Win-Win Performance Agreements   \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n   Creating Win-Win Performance Agreements requires  vital Paradigm Shifts.  The focus is on results; \nnot methods.  Most of us tend to supervise method s.  We use the gofer delegation discussed in Habit \n3, the methods management I used with Sandra when I asked her to take pictures of our son as he was \nwaterskiing.  But Win-Win Agreements focus on results, releasing tremendous individual human \npotential and creating greater synergy, building PC in  the process instead of focusing exclusively on P \n   With win-win accountability, people evaluate th emselves.  The traditional evaluation games people \nplay are awkward and emotionally exhausting.  In win-win, people  evaluate themselves, using the \ncriteria that they themselves helped to create up fr ont.  And if you set it up correctly, people can do \nthat.  With a Win-Win Delegation Agreement, even  a seven-year-old boy can tell for himself how well \nhe's keeping the yard \"green and clean.\"    My best experiences in teaching university cla sses have come when I have created a win-win shared \nunderstanding of the goal up front.  \"This is what  we're trying to accomplish.  Here are the basic \nrequirements for an A, B, or C grad e.  My goal is to help every on e of you get an A.  Now you take \nwhat we've talked about and analyze it and come up  with your own understanding of what you want \nto accomplish that is unique to you.

Then let's ge t together and agree on th e grade you wa nt and what \nyou plan to do to get it.\"    Management philosopher and consultant Peter Dr ucker recommends the use of a \"manager's letter\" \nto capture the essence of perfor mance agreements between managers and their employees.  Following \na deep and thorough discussion of expectations, guid elines, and resources to make sure they are in \nharmony with organizational goals,  the employee writes a letter to the manager that summarizes the \ndiscussion and indicates when the next performa nce plan or review discussion will take place. \n   Developing such a Win-Win Agreement is the ce ntral activity of management.  With an agreement \nin place, employees can manage themselves within  the framework of that agreement.  The manager \nthen can serve like a pace car in a race.  He can get things going and then get out of the way.  His job \nfrom then on is to remove the oil spills.    When a boss becomes the first a ssistant to each of his subordinates , he can greatly increase his span \nof control.  Entire levels of administrations and ov erhead are eliminated.  Instead of supervising six or \neight, such a manager can supervise twenty, thirty, fifty, or more.    In Win-Win Agreements, consequences become th e natural or logical results of performance rather \nthan a reward or punishment arbitrarily handed out by the person in charge. \n   There are basically four kinds of consequences (rewards and penalties) that management or parents \ncan control -- financial, psychic, opportunity, and responsibility.  Financial consequences include such \nthings as income, stock options, allowances, or pe nalties.  Psychic or psychological consequences \ninclude recognition, approval, respect, credibility, or  the loss of them.  Unless people are in a survival \nmode, psychic compensation is often more motiva ting than financial compensation.  Opportunity \nincludes training, development, perks, and other be nefits.  Responsibility has to do with scope and \nauthority, either of which can be enlarged or di minished.  Win-Win Agreements specify consequences \nin one or more of those areas and the people involved  know it up front.  So you don't play games.  \nEverything is clear from the beginning.    In addition to these logical, personal consequenc es, it is also important to  clearly identify what the \nnatural organizational consequences are.  For example, what will happen if I'm la te to work, if I refuse \nto cooperate with others, if I don't develop good Wi n-Win Agreements with my subordinates, if I don't \nhold them accountable for desired results, or if I don't promote their professional growth and career \ndevelopment.    When my daughter turned 16, we set up a Win- Win Agreement regarding use of the family car.  \nWe agreed that she would obey the laws of the land  and that she would keep the car clean and properly \nmaintained.  We agreed that she would use the car only for responsi ble purposes and would serve as a \ncab driver for her mother and me within reason.  And we also agreed that sh e would do all her other \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \njobs cheerfully without being reminded.  These were our wins. \n   We also agreed that I would provide some re sources -- the car, gas, and insurance.  And we agreed \nthat she would meet weekly with me, usually on Sunday afternoon, to evaluate how she was doing \nbased on our agreement.  The consequences were clear.  As long as she kept he r part of the agreement, \nshe could use the car.  If she didn't keep it, sh e would lose the privilege until she decided to. \n   This Win-Win Agreement set up clear expectations  from the beginning on both our parts.  It was a \nwin for her -- she got to use the car -- and it was certainly a win for Sandra and me.  Now she could \nhandle her own transportation needs and even so me of ours.  We didn't have to worry about \nmaintaining the car or keeping it clean.  And we had a built-in acco untability, which meant I didn't \nhave to hover over her to manage her methods.  Her integrity, her conscience, her power of discernment and our high Emotional Bank Account ma naged her infinitely better.  We didn't have to",

There was no doubt that \nthose 40 people had won; but there was also the underlying awareness that 760 people had lost.    We immediately began educational and organizat ional development work to align the systems and \nstructures of the organization toward the win-win paradigm.  We involved people at a grass-roots \nlevel to develop the kinds of systems that would motivate them.  We also encouraged them to \ncooperate and synergize with each other so that as many as possible could achieve the desired results of \ntheir individually tailored performance agreements.    At the next rally one year later, there were over  1,000 sales associates present, and about 800 of them \nreceived awards.  There were a few individual winners based on comparisons, but the program \nprimarily focused on people achieving self-selecte d performance objectives and on groups achieving \nteam objectives.  There was no need to bring in the high school bands to artificially contrive the fanfare, \nthe cheerleading, and the psych up.

There was no doubt that \nthose 40 people had won; but there was also the underlying awareness that 760 people had lost.    We immediately began educational and organizat ional development work to align the systems and \nstructures of the organization toward the win-win paradigm.  We involved people at a grass-roots \nlevel to develop the kinds of systems that would motivate them.  We also encouraged them to \ncooperate and synergize with each other so that as many as possible could achieve the desired results of \ntheir individually tailored performance agreements.    At the next rally one year later, there were over  1,000 sales associates present, and about 800 of them \nreceived awards.  There were a few individual winners based on comparisons, but the program \nprimarily focused on people achieving self-selecte d performance objectives and on groups achieving \nteam objectives.  There was no need to bring in the high school bands to artificially contrive the fanfare, \nthe cheerleading, and the psych up.  There was trem endous natural interest and excitement because \npeople could share in each others' happiness, and te a",

I did some consulting for another company that wa nted training for their people in human relations.  \nThe underlying assumption was th at the problem was the people. \n   The president said, \"Go into any store you want  and see how they treat you.  They're just order \ntakers.  They don't understand how to get close to the customers.

And he was righ t.  But that still didn't answer the question in my \nmind: What caused the attitude?    \"Look, we're on top of the problem,\" the pres ident said.  \"We have department heads out there \nsetting a great example.  We've told them their job is two-thirds selling and one-third management, \nand they're outselling everybody.

Because of the job definition and the \ncompensation system, the managers were \"creaming. \"  They'd stand behind the cash register and \ncream all the business durin\ng the slow times.  Half the time in retail is slow and the other half is frantic.  \nSo the managers would give all the dirty jobs -- in ventory control, stock work, and cleaning -- to the \nsalespeople.  And they would stand behind the re gisters and cream.  That's why the department \nheads were top in sales.    So we changed one system -- the compensation system -- and the problem was corrected overnight.  \nWe set up a system whereby the managers only made money when their salespeople made money.  \nWe overlapped the needs and goals of the managers wi th the needs and goals of the salespeople.  And \nthe need for human-relations training suddenly disappeared.  The key was developing a true win-win reward system.    In another instance, I worked with a manage r in a company that required formal performance \nevaluation.  He was frustrated over the evaluation  rating he had given a particular manager.  \"He \ndeserved a three,\" he said, \"but I had to give him a one\" (which meant superior, promotable). \n   \"What did you give him a one for?\" I asked.    \"He gets the numbers,\" was his reply.    \"So why do you think he deserves a three?\"    \"It's the way he gets them.  He neglects pe ople; he runs over them.  He's a troublemaker.\" \n   \"It sounds like he's totally focused on P -- on pr oduction.  And that's what he's being rewarded for.  \nBut what would happen if you talk ed with him about the problem, if you helped him understand the \nimportance of PC?\"    He said he had done so, with no effect.  \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n   \"Then what if you set up a win-win contract with  him where you both agreed  that two-thirds of his \ncompensation would come from P -- from numbers -- and the other one-thir d would come from PC -- \nhow other people perceive him, what kind of leader, people builder, team builder he is?\" \n   \"Now that would get his attention,\" he replied.    So often the problem is in the system, not in th e people.  If you put good people in bad systems, \nyou get bad results.  You have to water the flowers you want to grow.    As people really learn to Think Win-Win, they can set up the systems to create and reinforce it.  \nThey can transform unnecessarily competitive situatio ns to cooperative ones and can powerfully impact \ntheir effectiveness by building both P and PC.    In business, executives can align their systems to  create teams of highly productive people working \ntogether to compete against external standards of performance.  In education",

He was frustrated over the evaluation  rating he had given a particular manager.  \"He \ndeserved a three,\" he said, \"but I had to give him a one\" (which meant superior, promotable). \n   \"What did you give him a one for?\" I asked.    \"He gets the numbers,\" was his reply.    \"So why do you think he deserves a three?\"    \"It's the way he gets them.  He neglects pe ople; he runs over them.  He's a troublemaker.\" \n   \"It sounds like he's totally focused on P -- on pr oduction.  And that's what he's being rewarded for.  \nBut what would happen if you talk ed with him about",
