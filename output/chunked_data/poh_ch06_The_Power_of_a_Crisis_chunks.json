A few years later, a surgeon was preparing for a routine abdominal operation when a nurse called for a  “time- out.” Such pauses are standard procedure at most hospitals, a way for doctors and staff to make sure mistakes are avoided. The nursing staff at Rhode Island Hospital was insistent on  time- outs, particularly since a surgeon had accidentally removed the tonsils of a girl who was supposed to have eye surgery.  Time- outs were supposed to catch such errors before they occurred.\nAt the abdominal surgery, when the OR nurse asked the team to \ngather around the patient for a  time- out and to discuss their plan, the doctor headed for the doors.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   155 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   155 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n156 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\n“Why don ’t you lead this?” the surgeon told the nurse. “I’m going \nto step outside for a call.

She never contradicted a physician again, and never said anything when other safety policies were ignored.\n“Some doctors were ﬁ  ne, and some were monsters,” one nurse \nwho worked at Rhode Island Hospital in the mid-2000s told me. “We called it the glass factory, because it felt like everything could crash down at any minute.”\nTo deal with these tensions, the staff had developed informal \n rules— habits unique to the  institution— that helped avert the most obvious conﬂ  icts. Nurses, for instance, always  double- checked \nthe orders of  error- prone physicians and quietly made sure that correct doses were entered; they took extra time to write clearly on patients’ charts, lest a hasty surgeon make the wrong cut. One nurse told me they developed a system of color codes to warn one another. “We put doctors’ names in different colors on the white-boards,” she said. “Blue meant ‘nice,’ red meant ‘jerk,’ and black meant, ‘whatever you do, don ’t contradict them or they’ll take your head off.’”\nRhode Island Hospital was a place ﬁ  lled with a corrosive culture. \nUnlike at Alcoa, where carefully designed keystone habits surround-ing worker safety had created larger and larger successes, inside Rhode Island Hospital, habits emerged on the ﬂ  y among nurses \nseeking to offset physician arrogance.

We’ve got to relieve the pressure.”\n“What if we ﬁ  nd the family?” the nurse asked.\n“If that’s what you want, then call the fucking ER and ﬁ  nd the \nfamily! In the meantime, I’m going to save his life.” The surgeon grabbed the paperwork, scribbled “right” on the consent form, and initialed it.\n“There,” he said. “We have to operate immediately.”The nurse had worked at Rhode Island Hospital for a year. He \nunderstood the hospital’s culture. This surgeon ’s name, the nurse knew, was often scribbled in black on the large whiteboard in the hallway, signaling that nurses should beware. The unwritten rules in this scenario were clear: The surgeon always wins.\nThe nurse put down the chart and stood aside as the doctor posi-\ntioned the elderly man ’s head in a cradle that provided access to the right side of his skull and shaved and applied antiseptic to his head. The plan was to open the skull and suction out the blood pooling on top of his brain. The surgeon sliced away a ﬂ  ap of scalp, exposed the \nskull, and put a drill against the white bone. He began pushing until the bit broke through with a soft pop. He made two more holes and used a saw to cut out a triangular piece of the man ’s skull. Under-neath was the dura, the translucent sheath surrounding the brain.\n“Oh my God,” someone said.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   158 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   158 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Power of a Crisis ● 159\nThere was no hematoma. They were operating on the wrong side \nof the head.\n“We need him turned!” the surgeon yelled.The triangle of bone was reattached with small metal plates and \nscrews, and the patient’s scalp sewed up. His head was shifted to the other side and then, once again, shaved, cleansed, cut, and drilled until a triangle of skull could be removed. This time, the hematoma was immediately visible, a dark bulge that spilled like thick syrup when the dura was pierced. The surgeon vacuumed the blood and the pressure inside the old man ’s skull fell immediately. The sur-gery, which should have taken about an hour, had run almost twice as long.\nAfterward, the patient was taken to the intensive care unit, but he \nnever regained full consciousness. Two weeks later, he died.\nA subsequent investigation said it was impossible to determine \nthe precise cause of death, but the patient’s family argued that the trauma of the medical error had overwhelmed his already fragile body, that the stress of removing two pieces of skull, the additional time in surgery, and the delay in evacuating the hematoma had pushed him over the edge. If not for the mistake, they claimed, he might still be alive.

Sometimes, in the heat of a crisis, the right habits emerge.\nII.\nWhen An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change  was ﬁ  rst pub-\nlished in 1982, very few people outside of academia noticed. The book’s bland cover and daunting ﬁ  rst sentence—“In this volume we \ndevelop an evolutionary theory of the capabilities and behavior of business ﬁ  rms operating in a market environment, and construct \nand analyze a number of models consistent with that theory”—almost seemed designed to ward off readers. The authors, Yale pro-fessors Richard Nelson and Sidney Winter, were best known for a series of intensely analytic papers exploring Schumpeterian theory that even most PhD candidates didn ’t pretend to understand.\nWithin the world of business strategy and organizational theory, \nhowever, the book went off like a bombshell. It was soon hailed as one of the most important texts of the century. Economics profes-sors started talking about it to their colleagues at business schools, who started talking to CEOs at conferences, and soon executives were quoting Nelson and Winter inside corporations as different as General Electric, Pﬁ  zer, and Starwood Hotels.\nNelson and Winter had spent more than a decade examining \nhow companies work, trudging through swamps of data before arriv ing at their central conclusion: “Much of ﬁ  rm behavior,” they \nwrote, is best “understood as a reﬂ  ection of general habits and stra-\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   160 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   160 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Power of a Crisis ● 161\ntegic orientations coming from the ﬁ  rm ’s past,” rather than “the re-\nsult of a detailed survey of the remote twigs of the decision tree.”\nOr, put in language that people use outside of theoretical eco-\nnomics, it may seem like most organizations make rational choices \nbased on deliberate decision making, but that’s not really how com-panies operate at all. Instead, ﬁ  rms are guided by  long- held organi-\nzational habits, patterns that often emerge from thousands of employees’ independent decisions. And these habits have more pro-found impacts than anyone previously understood.\nFor instance, it might seem like the chief executive of a clothing \ncompany made the decision last year to feature a red cardigan on the catalog’s cover by carefully reviewing sales and marketing data. But, in fact, what really happened was that his vice president con-stantly trolls websites devoted to Japanese fashion trends (where red was hip last spring), and the ﬁ  rm ’s marketers routinely ask their \nfriends which colors are “in,” and the company’s executives, back from their annual trip to the Paris runway shows, reported hearing that designers at rival ﬁ  rms were using new magenta pigments. All \nthese small inputs, the result of uncoordinated patterns among ex-ecutives gossiping about competitors and talking to their friends, got mixed into the company’s more formal research and develop-ment routines until a consensus emerged: Red will be popular this year. No one made a solitary, deliberate decision. Rather, dozens of habits, processes, and behaviors converged until it seemed like red was the inevitable choice.\nThese organizational  habits— or “routines,” as Nelson and Win-\nter called  them— are enormously important, because without them, most companies would never get any work done. Routines provide the hundreds of unwritten rules that companies need to operate. They allow workers to experiment with new ideas without having to ask for permission at every step. They provide a kind of “organiza-tional memory,” so that managers don ’t have to reinvent the sales \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   161 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   161 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n162 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nprocess every six months or panic each time a VP quits. Routines \nreduce  uncertainty— a study of recovery efforts after earthquakes in Mexico and Los Angeles, for instance, found that the habits of relief workers (which they carried from disaster to disaster, and which included things such as establishing communication networks by hiring children to carry messages between neighborhoods) were ab-solutely critical, “because without them, policy formulation and implementation would be lost in a jungle of detail.”\nBut among the most important beneﬁ  ts of routines is that they \ncreate truces between potentially warring groups or individuals within an",

A salesperson, for example, knows she can boost her bonus by giving favored customers hefty discounts in exchange for larger orders. But she also knows that if every salesperson gives \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   162 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   162 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Power of a Crisis ● 163\naway hefty discounts, the ﬁ  rm will go bankrupt and there won ’t be \nany bonuses to hand out. So a routine emerges: The salespeople all get together every January and agree to limit how many discounts they offer in order to protect the company’s proﬁ  ts, and at the end of \nthe year everyone gets a raise.\nOr take a young executive gunning for vice president who, with \none quiet phone call to a major customer, could kill a sale and sabo-tage a colleague’s division, taking him out of the running for the promotion. The problem with sabotage is that even if it’s good for you, it’s usually bad for the ﬁ  rm. So at most companies, an unspo-\nken compact emerges: It’s okay to be ambitious, but if you play too \nrough, your peers will unite against you. On the other hand, if you focus on boosting your own department, rather than undermining your rival, you’ll probably get taken care of over time.\nRoutines and truces offer a type of rough organizational justice, \nand because of them, Nelson and Winter wrote, conﬂ  ict within com-\npanies usually “follows largely predictable paths and stays within predictable bounds that are consistent with the ongoing rou-tine. . . . The usual amount of work gets done, reprimands and com-pliments are delivered with the usual frequency. . . . Nobody is trying to steer the organizational ship into a sharp turn in the hope of throwing a rival overboard.”Routine\nReward CueRoutine\nReward Cue\nROUTINES CREATE TRUCES \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   163 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   163 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n164 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nMost of the time, routines and truces work perfectly. Rivalries \nstill exist, of course, but because of institutional habits, they’re kept within bounds and the business thrives.\nHowever, sometimes even a truce proves insufﬁ  cient. Some-\ntimes, as Rhode Island Hospital discovered, an unstable peace can be as destructive as any civil war.\n● ● ●\nSomewhere in your ofﬁ  ce, buried in a desk drawer, there’s probably \na handbook you received on your ﬁ  rst day of work. It contains ex-\npense forms and rules about vacations, insurance options, and the company’s organizational chart. It has brightly colored graphs de-scribing different health care plans, a list of relevant phone num-bers, and instructions on how to access your email or enroll in the 401(k).\nNow, imagine what you would tell a new colleague who asked for \n",

The ones who have formed the right truces and found the right alliances. Truces are so important that new fashion labels usually succeed only if they are headed by people who left other fashion \ncompanies on good terms.\nSome might think Nelson and Winter were writing a book on dry \neconomic theory. But what they really produced was a guide to sur-viving in corporate America.\nWhat’s more, Nelson and Winter’s theories also explain why \nthings went so wrong at Rhode Island Hospital. The hospital had routines that created an uneasy peace between nurses and  doctors— the whiteboards, for instance, and the warnings nurses whispered to one another were habits that established a baseline truce. These delicate pacts allowed the organization to function most of the time. But truces are only durable when they create real justice. If a truce is  unbalanced— if the peace isn ’t  real— then the routines often fail when they are needed most.\nThe critical issue at Rhode Island Hospital was that the nurses \nwere the only ones giving up power to strike a truce. It was the nurses who  double- checked patients’ medications and made extra efforts to write clearly on charts; the nurses who absorbed abuse from  stressed- out doctors; the nurses who helped separate kind physicians from the despots, so the rest of the staff knew who toler-ated  operating- room suggestions and who would explode if you \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   165 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   165 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n166 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nopened your mouth. The doctors often didn ’t bother to learn the \nnurses’ names. “The doctors were in charge, and we were under-lings,” one nurse told me. “We tucked our tails and survived.”\nThe truces at Rhode Island Hospital were  one- sided. So at those \ncrucial  moments— when, for instance, a surgeon was about to make a hasty incision and a nurse tried to  intervene— the routines that could have prevented the accident crumbled, and the wrong side of an  eighty- six- year- old man ’s head was opened up.\nSome might suggest that the solution is more equitable truces. \nThat if the hospital’s leadership did a better job of allocating author-ity",

He didn ’t try to ﬁ  gure out why \nthe tissue was burning or if it might have ﬂ  own off of a larger ﬁ  re \nsomewhere else within the station. He didn ’t mention the incident to another employee or call the ﬁ  re department. A separate depart-\nment handled ﬁ  re safety, and Brickell, in keeping with the strict divi-\nsions that ruled the Underground, knew better than to step on anyone’s toes. Besides, even if he had investigated the possibility of \na ﬁ re, he wouldn ’t have known what to do with any information he \nlearned. The tightly prescribed chain of command at the Under-ground prohibited him from contacting another department with-out a superior’s direct authorization. And the Underground’s  routines— handed down from employee to  employee— told him that he should never, under any circumstances, refer out loud to anything  inside a station as a “ﬁ  re,” lest commuters become pan-\nicked. It wasn ’t how things were done.\nThe Underground was governed by a sort of theoretical rule book \nthat no one had ever seen or  read— and that didn ’t, in fact, exist ex-cept in the unwritten rules that shaped every employee’s life. For decades, the Underground had been run by the “Four Barons”—the chiefs of civil, signal, electrical, and mechanical  engineering— and within each of their departments, there were bosses and subbosses who all jealously guarded their authority. The trains ran on time because all nineteen thousand Underground employees cooperated in a delicate system that passed passengers and trains among  dozens— sometimes  hundreds— of hands all day long.

The policeman who had noticed the haze, however, ﬁ  gured he should contact headquarters. \nHis radio didn ’t work underground, so he walked up a long staircase into the outdoors and called his superiors, who eventually passed word to the ﬁ  re department. At 7:36 \nP.M.— twenty- two minutes after \nBrickell was alerted to the ﬂ  aming  tissue— the ﬁ  re brigade received \na call: “Small ﬁ  re at King’s Cross.” Commuters were pushing past \nthe policeman as he stood outside, speaking on his radio. They were rushing into the station, down into the tunnels, focused on getting home for dinner.\nWithin minutes, many of them would be dead.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   169 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   169 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n170 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\n● ● ●\nAt 7:36, an Underground worker roped off entry to the Piccadilly \nescalator and another started diverting people to a different stair-way.

More than two dozen studies and reprimands had said that the Underground was unprepared for ﬁ  res, and that staff \nneeded to be trained in how to use sprinklers and ﬁ  re extinguishers, \nwhich were positioned on every train platform.

There was a line of people standing at the ticket machines and hundreds of people milling about the room, walking to platforms or leaving the station. Hayes found a policeman.\n“We’ve got to stop the trains and get everyone out of here,” he \ntold him. “The ﬁ  re is out of control. It’s going everywhere.”\nAt 7:42— almost a half hour after the burning  tissue— the ﬁ  rst \nﬁ reman arrived at King’s Cross. As he entered the ticketing hall he \nsaw dense black smoke starting to snake along the ceiling. The esca-lator’s rubber handrails had begun to burn. As the acrid smell of burning rubber spread, commuters in the ticketing hall began to recognize that something was wrong. They moved toward the exits as ﬁ remen waded through the crowd, ﬁ  ghting against the tide.\nBelow, the ﬁ  re was spreading. The entire escalator was now \naﬂ ame, producing a superheated gas that rose to the top of the shaft, \nenclosing the escalator, where it was trapped against the tunnel’s ceiling, which was covered with about twenty layers of old paint. A few years earlier, the Underground’s director of operations had sug-gested that all this paint might pose a ﬁ  re hazard. Perhaps, he said, \nthe old layers should be removed before a new one is applied?\nPainting protocols were not in his purview, however. Paint re-\nsponsibility resided with the maintenance department, whose chief politely thanked his colleague for the recommendation, and then noted that if he wanted to interfere with other departments, the favor would be swiftly returned.\nThe director of operations withdrew his recommendation.As the superheated gases pooled along the ceiling of the escala-\ntor shaft, all those old layers of paint began absorbing the warmth. As each new train arrived, it pushed a fresh gust of oxygen into the station, feeding the ﬁ  re like a bellows.\nAt 7:43 \nP.M., a train arrived and a salesman named Mark Silver \nexited. He knew immediately that something was wrong. The air \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   171 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   171 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n172 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nwas hazy, the platform packed with people. Smoke wafted around \nwhere he was standing, curling around the train cars as they sat on the tracks. He turned to reenter the train, but the doors had closed. He hammered on the windows, but there was an unofﬁ  cial policy to \navoid tardiness: Once the doors were sealed, they did not open again. Up and down the platform, Silver and other passengers screamed at the driver to open the doors. The signal light changed to green, and the train pulled away. One woman jumped on the tracks, running after the train as it moved into the tunnel. “Let me in!” she screamed.\nSilver walked down the platform,",

Unlike at Rhode Island Hospital, each truce cre-ated a genuine balance of power.

How do nurses and doctors share authority while still making it clear who is in charge?

It’s the same op-\nportunity Howard Schultz exploited when he returned to a ﬂ  agging \nStarbucks in 2007. All those leaders seized the possibilities created by a crisis. During turmoil, organizational habits become malleable enough to both assign responsibility and create a more equitable balance of power. Crises are so valuable, in fact, that sometimes it’s worth stirring up a sense of looming catastrophe rather than letting it die down.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   175 Duhi_978",

How can an or-\nganization implement habits that balance authority and, at the same time, choose a person or goal that rises above everyone else? How do nurses and doctors share authority while still making it clear who is in charge? How does a subway system avoid becoming bogged down in turf battles while making sure safety is still a prior-ity, even if that means lines of authority must be redrawn?\nThe answer lies in seizing the same advantage that Tony Dungy \nencountered when he took over the woeful Bucs and Paul O’Neill discovered when he became CEO of ﬂ  ailing Alcoa.

Sometimes people need a jolt, and all the bad publicity was a serious  \njolt. It gave us a chance to reexamine everything.”\nRhode Island Hospital shut down all elective surgery units for an \nentire  day— a huge  expense— and put the entire staff through an in-tensive training program that emphasized teamwork and stressed the importance of empowering nurses and medical staff. The chief of neurosurgery resigned and a new leader was selected. The hospi-tal invited the Center for Transforming  Healthcare— a coalition of leading medical  institutions— to help redesign its surgical safe-guards. Administrators installed video cameras in operating rooms to make sure  time- outs occurred and checklists were mandated for every surgery. A computerized system allowed any hospital employee to anonymously report problems that endangered patient health.\nSome of those initiatives had been proposed at Rhode Island \nHospital in previous years, but they had always been struck down. Doctors and nurses didn ’t want people recording their surgeries or other hospitals telling them how to do their jobs.\nBut once a sense of crisis gripped Rhode Island Hospital",
