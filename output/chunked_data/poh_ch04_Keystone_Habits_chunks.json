They were there to meet the new CEO of the Alu-minum Company of  America— or Alcoa, as it was  known— a corpo-ration that, for nearly a century, had manufactured everything from the foil that wraps Hershey’s Kisses and the metal in  Coca- Cola cans to the bolts that hold satellites together.\nAlcoa’s founder had invented the process for smelting alumi-\nnum a century earlier, and since then the company had become one of the largest on earth. Many of the people in the audience had in-vested millions in Alcoa stock and had enjoyed a steady return. In the past year, however, investor grumblings started. Alcoa’s man-agement had made misstep after misstep, unwisely trying to expand into new product lines while competitors stole customers and prof-its away.\nSo there had been a palpable sense of relief when Alcoa’s board \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   97 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   97 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n98 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nannounced it was time for new leadership. That relief, though, \nturned to unease when the choice was announced: the new CEO would be a former government bureaucrat named Paul O’Neill. Many on Wall Street had never heard of him. When Alcoa sched-uled this meet and greet at the Manhattan ballroom, every major investor asked for an invitation.\nA few minutes before noon, O’Neill took the stage. He was \n ﬁ fty- one years old, trim, and dressed in gray pinstripes and a red \npower tie. His hair was white and his posture military straight. He bounced up the steps and smiled warmly. He looked digniﬁ  ed, solid, \nconﬁ dent. Like a chief executive.\nThen he opened his mouth.“I want to talk to you about worker safety,” he said. “Every year, \nnumerous Alcoa workers are injured so badly that they miss a day of work. Our safety record is better than the general American work-force, especially considering that our employees work with metals that are 1500 degrees and machines that can rip a man ’s arm off. But it’s not good enough. I intend to make Alcoa the safest company in America. I intend to go for zero injuries.”\nThe audience was confused. These meetings usually followed a \npredictable script: A new CEO would start with an introduction, make a faux  self- deprecating  joke— something about how he slept his way through Harvard Business  School— then promise to boost proﬁ ts and lower costs. Next would come an excoriation of taxes, \nbusiness regulations, and sometimes, with a fervor that suggested ﬁ rsthand experience in divorce court, lawyers. Finally, the speech \nwould end with a blizzard of buzzwords—“synergy,” “rightsizing,” and  “co- opetition ”—at which point everyone could return to their ofﬁ ces, reassured that capitalism was safe for another day.\nO’Neill hadn ’t said anything about proﬁ  ts. He didn ’t mention \ntaxes. There was no talk of “using alignment to achieve a  win- win synergistic market advantage.” For all anyone in the audience knew, \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   98 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   98 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nKeystone Habits, or The Ballad of Paul O’Neill  ● 99\ngiven his talk of worker safety, O’Neill might be   pro- regulation.

Safety? Fire exits? Was this a joke? One investor in the audi-ence knew that O’Neill had been in Washington, D.C., during the sixties. Guy must have done a lot of drugs,  he thought.\nEventually, someone raised a hand and asked about inventories \nin the aerospace division. Another asked about the company’s capi-tal ratios.\n“I’m not certain you heard me,” O’Neill said. “If you want to un-\nderstand how Alcoa is doing, you need to look at our workplace safety ﬁ  gures. If we bring our injury rates down, it won ’t be because \nof cheerleading or the nonsense you sometimes hear from other CEOs. It will be because the individuals at this company have agreed to become part of something important: They’ve devoted themselves to creating a habit of excellence. Safety will be an indicator that we’re making progress in changing our habits across the entire institu-tion. That’s how we should be judged.”\nThe investors in the room almost stampeded out the doors when \nthe presentation ended.

By the time O’Neill retired in 2000, the company’s annual net income was ﬁ  ve times larger than before he arrived, and its mar-\nket capitalization had risen by $27 billion. Someone who invested a million dollars in Alcoa on the day O’Neill was hired would have earned another million dollars in dividends while he headed the company, and the value of their stock would be ﬁ  ve times bigger \nwhen he left.\nWhat’s more, all that growth occurred while Alcoa became one of \nthe safest companies in the world. Before O’Neill’s arrival, almost every Alcoa plant had at least one accident per week. Once his safety plan was implemented, some facilities would go years without a single employee losing a workday due to an accident. The compa-ny’s worker injury rate fell to  one- twentieth the U.S. average.\nSo how did O’Neill make one of the largest, stodgiest, and most \npotentially dangerous companies into a proﬁ  t machine and a bas-\ntion of safety?\nBy attacking one habit and then watching the changes ripple \nthrough the organization.\n“I knew I had to transform Alcoa,” O’Neill told me. “But you \ncan ’t order people to change. That’s not how the brain works. So I \ndecided I was going to start by focusing on one thing. If I could start disrupting the habits around one thing, it would spread throughout the entire company.”\nO’Neill believed that some habits have the power to start a chain \nreaction, changing other habits as they move through an organiza-tion. Some habits, in other words, matter more than others in re-making businesses and lives. These are “keystone habits,” and they can inﬂ  uence how people work, eat, play, live, spend, and commu-\nnicate.

This book’s ﬁ  rst sec-\ntion explained how habits work, how they can be created and changed. However, where should a  would- be habit master start? Understanding keystone habits holds the answer to that question: The habits that matter most are the ones that, when they start to shift, dislodge and remake other patterns.\nKeystone habits explain how Michael Phelps became an Olympic \nchampion and why some college students outperform their peers. They describe why some people, after years of trying, suddenly lose forty pounds while becoming more productive at work and still get-ting home in time for dinner with their kids. And keystone habits explain how Alcoa became one of the best performing stocks in the Dow Jones index, while also becoming one of the safest places on earth.\n● ● ●\nWhen Alcoa ﬁ  rst approached O’Neill about becoming CEO, he \nwasn ’t sure he wanted the job. He’d already earned plenty of money, and his wife liked Connecticut, where they lived. They didn ’t know anything about Pittsburgh, where Alcoa was headquartered. But be-fore turning down the offer, O’Neill asked for some time to think it over. To help himself make the decision, he started working on a list of what would be his biggest priorities if he accepted the post.\nO’Neill had always been a big believer in lists. Lists were how he \norganized his life. In college at Fresno  State— where he ﬁ  nished his \ncourses in a bit over three years, while also working thirty hours a  week— O’Neill had drafted a list of everything he hoped to accom-plish during his lifetime, including, near the top, “Make a Differ-ence.” After graduating in 1960, at a friend’s encouragement, O’Neill picked up an application for a federal internship and, along with \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   101 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   101 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n102 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nthree hundred thousand others, took the government employment \nexam. Three thousand people were chosen for interviews. Three hundred of them were offered jobs. O’Neill was one.\nHe started as a middle manager at the Veterans Administration \nand was told to learn about computer systems. All the while, O’Neill kept writing his lists, recording why some projects were more suc-cessful than others, which contractors delivered on time and which didn ’t. He was promoted each year. And as he rose through the VA’s ranks, he made a name for himself as someone whose lists always seemed to include a bullet point that got a problem solved.\nBy the mid-1960s, such skills were in high demand in Washing-\nton, D.C.

The \ntowns where the new hospitals were located didn ’t necessarily need \nmore patient beds, but that didn ’t matter. What mattered was erect-ing a big structure that a politician could point to while stumping for votes.\nFederal workers would “spend months debating blue or yellow \ncurtains, ﬁ  guring out if patient rooms should contain one or two \ntelevisions, designing nurses’ stations, real pointless stuff,” O’Neill told me. “Most of the time, no one ever asked if the town wanted a hospital. The bureaucrats had gotten into a habit of solving every medical problem by building something so that a congressman could say, ‘Here’s what I did!’ It didn ’t make any sense, but every-body did the same thing again and again.”\nResearchers have found institutional habits in almost every orga-\nnization or company they’ve scrutinized. “Individuals have habits; groups have routines,” wrote the academic Geoffrey Hodgson, who spent a career examining organizational patterns. “Routines are the organizational analogue of habits.”\nTo O’Neill, these kinds of habits seemed dangerous. “We were \nbasically ceding decision making to a process that occurred without actually thinking,” O’Neill said. But at other agencies, where change was in the air, good organizational habits were creating success.\nSome departments at NASA, for instance, were overhauling \nthemselves by deliberately instituting organizational routines that Routine  \nCRAVING FOR \nCAREER \nADVANCEMENTReward Cue\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   103 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   103 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n104 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nencouraged engineers to take more risks. When unmanned rockets \nexploded on takeoff, department heads would applaud, so that ev-eryone would know their division had tried and failed, but at least they had tried. Eventually, mission control ﬁ  lled with applause every \ntime something expensive blew up. It became an organizational habit. Or take the Environmental Protection Agency, which was cre-ated in 1970. The EPA’s ﬁ  rst administrator, William Ruckelshaus, \nconsciously engineered organizational habits that encouraged his regulators to be aggressive on enforcement. When lawyers asked for permission to ﬁ  le a lawsuit or enforcement action, it went through \na process for approval. The default was authorization to go ahead. The message was clear: At the EPA, aggression gets rewarded. By 1975, the EPA was issuing more than ﬁ  fteen hundred new environ-\nmental rules a year.\n“Every time I looked at a different part of the government, I \nfound these habits that seemed to explain why things were either succeeding or failing,” O’Neill told me. “The best agencies under-stood the importance of routines. The worst agencies were headed by people who never thought about it, and then wondered why no one followed their orders.”\nIn 1977, after sixteen years in Washington, D.C., O’Neill decided \nit was time to leave. He was working ﬁ  fteen hours a day, seven days \na week, and his wife was tired of raising four children on her own. O’Neill resigned and landed a job with International Paper, the world’s largest pulp and paper company. He eventually became its president.\nBy then, some of his old government friends were on Alcoa’s \nboard. When the company needed a new chief executive, they thought of him, which is how he ended up writing a list of his pri-orities if he decided to take the job.\nAt the time, Alcoa was struggling. Critics said the company’s \nworkers weren ’t nimble enough and the quality of its products was poor. But at the top of O’Neill’s list he didn ’t write “quality” or “efﬁ  -\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   104 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   104 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nKeystone Habits, or The Ballad of Paul O’Neill  ● 105\nciency” as his biggest priorities.

You shouldn ’t be scared that feeding your family is going to kill you. That’s what I decided to focus on: changing everyone’s safety habits.”\nAt the top of O’Neill’s list he wrote down “SAFETY” and set an \naudacious goal: zero injuries. Not zero factory injuries. Zero inju-ries, period. That would be his commitment no matter how much it cost.\nO’Neill decided to take the job.\n● ● ●\n“I’m really glad to be here,” O’Neill told a room full of workers at a smelting plant in Tennessee a few months after he was hired. Not everything had gone smoothly. Wall Street was still panicked. The unions were concerned. Some of Alcoa’s vice presidents were miffed at being passed over for the top job. And O’Neill kept talking about worker safety.\n“I’m happy to negotiate with you about anything,” O’Neill said. \nHe was on a tour of Alcoa’s American plants, after which he was \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   105 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   105 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n106 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\ngoing to visit the company’s facilities in  thirty- one other countries. \n“But there’s one thing I’m never going to negotiate with you, and that’s safety. I don ’t ever want you to say that we haven ’t taken every step to make sure people don ’t get hurt. If you want to argue with me about that, you’re going to lose.”\nThe brilliance of this approach was that no one, of course, wanted \nto argue with O’Neill about worker safety. Unions had been ﬁ  ghting \nfor better safety rules for years. Managers didn ’t want to argue about it, either, since injuries meant lost productivity and low morale.\nWhat most people didn ’t realize, however, was that O’Neill’s plan \nfor getting to zero injuries entailed the most radical realignment in Alcoa’s history. The key to protecting Alcoa employees, O’Neill be-lieved, was understanding why injuries happened in the ﬁ  rst place. \nAnd to understand why injuries happened, you had to study how the \nmanufacturing process was going wrong. To understand how things \nwere going wrong, you had to bring in people who could educate workers about quality control and the most efﬁ  cient work processes, \nso that it would be easier to do everything right, since correct work is also safer work.\nIn other words, to protect workers, Alcoa needed to become the \nbest, most streamlined aluminum company on earth.\nO’Neill’s safety plan, in effect, was modeled on the habit loop. He \nidentiﬁ  ed a simple cue: an employee injury. He instituted an auto-\nmatic routine: Any time someone was injured, the unit president had to report it to O’Neill within  twenty- four hours and present a plan for making sure the injury never happened again. And there was a reward: The only people who got promoted were those who embraced the system.\nUnit presidents were busy people. To contact O’Neill within \n twenty- four hours of an injury, they needed to hear about an acci-dent from their vice presidents as soon as it happened. So vice pres-idents needed to be in constant communication with ﬂ  oor managers. \nAnd ﬂ  oor managers needed to get workers to raise warnings as soon \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   106 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all",

One of them was standing on top of the \nbridge’s guardrail, while the other held on to his belt. They weren ’t using safety harnesses or ropes. “They worked for some company that has nothing to do with us, but without thinking about it, I got out of my chair, went down ﬁ  ve ﬂ ights of stairs, walked over the \nbridge and told these guys, hey, you’re risking your life, you have to use your harness and safety gear.” The men explained their supervi-sor had forgotten to bring the equipment. So Shockey called the local Occupational Safety and Health Administration ofﬁ  ce and \nturned the supervisor in.\n“ Another executive told me that one day, he stopped at a street \nexcavation near his house because they didn ’t have a trench box, and gave everyone a lecture on the importance of proper procedures. It was the weekend, and he stopped his car, with his kids in the back, to lecture city workers about trench safety. That isn ’t natural, but that’s kind of the point. We do this stuff without thinking about it now.”\nO’Neill never promised that his focus on worker safety would \nincrease Alcoa’s proﬁ  ts. However, as his new routines moved \nthrough the organization, costs came down, quality went up, and productivity skyrocketed. If molten metal was injuring workers when it splashed, then the pouring system was redesigned, which led to fewer injuries. It also saved money because Alcoa lost fewer raw materials in spills. If a machine kept breaking down, it was re-placed, which meant there was less risk of a broken gear snagging an employee’s arm. It also meant higher quality products because, as Alcoa discovered, equipment malfunctions were a chief cause of subpar aluminum.\nResearchers have found similar dynamics in dozens of other set-\ntings, including individuals’ lives.\nTake, for instance, studies from the past decade examining the \nimpacts of exercise on daily routines.

He \nhad already won three gold medals earlier that  week— giving him nine in his  career— and had two races that day. By 7 \nA.M., he was in \nthe cafeteria, eating his regular  race- day menu of eggs, oatmeal, and four energy shakes, the ﬁ  rst of more than six thousand calories he \nwould consume over the next sixteen hours.\nPhelps’s ﬁ  rst  race— the 200-meter butterﬂ  y, his strongest \n event— was scheduled for ten o’clock. Two hours before the starting gun ﬁ  red, he began his usual stretching regime, starting with his \narms, then his back, then working down to his ankles, which were so ﬂ exible they could extend more than ninety degrees, farther than \na ballerina’s en pointe . At  eight- thirty, he slipped into the pool and \nbegan his ﬁ  rst  warm- up lap, 800 meters of mixed styles, followed by \n600 meters of kicking, 400 meters pulling a buoy between his legs, 200 meters of stroke drills, and a series of 25-meter sprints to ele-vate his heart rate. The workout took precisely  forty- ﬁ ve minutes.\nAt  nine- ﬁ  fteen, he exited the pool and started squeezing into his \nLZR Racer, a bodysuit so tight it required twenty minutes of tugging to put it on. Then he clamped headphones over his ears, cranked up the  hip- hop mix he played before every race, and waited.\nPhelps had started swimming when he was seven years old to \nburn off some of the energy that was driving his mom and teachers crazy. When a local swimming coach named Bob Bowman saw Phelps’s long torso, big hands, and relatively short legs (which of-fered less drag in the water), he knew Phelps could become a cham-pion. But Phelps was emotional. He had trouble calming down before races. His parents were divorcing, and he had problems cop-ing with the stress. Bowman purchased a book of relaxation exer-cises and asked Phelps’s mom to read them aloud every night. The book contained a script—“Tighten your right hand into a ﬁ  st and \nrelease it. Imagine the tension melting away”—that tens",

It’s not that a family meal or a tidy bed causes better grades \nor less frivolous spending. But somehow those initial shifts start chain reactions that help other good habits take hold.\nIf you focus on changing or cultivating keystone habits, you can \ncause widespread shifts. However, identifying keystone habits is tricky. To ﬁ  nd them, you have to know where to look. Detecting key-\nstone habits means searching out certain characteristics. Keystone habits offer what is known within academic literature as “small wins.” They help other habits to ﬂ  ourish by creating new structures, \nand they establish cultures where change becomes contagious.\nBut as O’Neill and countless others have found, crossing the gap \nbetween understanding those principles and using them requires a bit of ingenuity.\nII.\nWhen Michael Phelps’s alarm clock went off at 6:30 A.M. on the \nmorning of August 13, 2008, he crawled out of bed in the Olympic Village in Beijing and fell right into his routine.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j",

Bowman could also see that Phelps, even at a young age, had a capacity for obsessiveness that made him an ideal athlete. Then again, all elite performers are ob-sessives.\nWhat Bowman could give Phelps,  however— what would set him \napart from other  competitors— were habits that would make him the strongest mental swimmer in the pool. He didn ’t need to control every aspect of Phelps’s life. All he needed to do was target a few speciﬁ  c habits that had nothing to do with swimming and every-\nthing to do with creating the right mind-set. He designed a series of behaviors that Phelps could use to become calm and focused before each race, to ﬁ  nd those tiny advantages that, in a sport where victory \ncan come in milliseconds, would make all the difference.\nWhen Phelps was a teenager, for instance, at the end of each \npractice, Bowman would tell him to go home and “watch the video-tape. Watch it before you go to sleep and when you wake up.”\nThe videotape wasn ’t real. Rather, it was a mental visualization of \nthe perfect race. Each night before falling asleep and each morning after waking up, Phelps would imagine himself jumping off the blocks and, in slow motion, swimming ﬂ  awlessly. He would visual-\nize his strokes, the walls of the pool, his turns, and the ﬁ  nish. He \nwould imagine the wake behind his body, the water dripping off his lips as his mouth cleared the surface, what it would feel like to rip off his cap at the end. He would lie in bed with his eyes shut and watch the entire competition, the smallest details, again and again, until he knew each second by heart.\nDuring practices, when Bowman ordered Phelps to swim at race \nspeed, he would shout, “Put in the videotape!” and Phelps would push himself, as hard as he could. It almost felt anticlimactic as he cut through the water. He had done this so many times in his head that, by now, it felt rote. But it worked. He got faster and faster. Even-\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   111 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   111 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n112 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\ntually, all Bowman had to do before a race was whisper, “Get the \nvideotape ready,” and Phelps would settle down and crush the com-petition.\nAnd once Bowman established a few core routines in Phelps’s \nlife, all the other  habits— his diet and practice schedules, the stretch-ing and sleep  routines— seemed to fall into place on their own. At the core of why those habits were so effective, why they acted as keystone habits, was something known within academic literature as a “small win.”\n● ● ●\nSmall wins are exactly what they sound like, and are part of how keystone habits create widespread changes. A huge body of research has shown that small wins have enormous power, an inﬂ  uence dis-\nproportionate to the accomplishments of the victories themselves. “Small wins are a steady application of a small advantage,” one Cor-nell professor wrote in 1984. “Once a small win has been accom-plished, forces are set in motion that favor another small win.” Small wins fuel transformative changes by leveraging tiny advan-tages into patterns that convince people that bigger achievements are within reach.\nFor example, when gay rights organizations started campaigning \nagainst homophobia in the late 1960s, their initial efforts yielded only a string of failures. They pushed to repeal laws used to prose-cute gays and were roundly defeated in state legislatures. Teachers tried to create curriculums to counsel gay",

Watch it before you go to sleep and when you wake up.”\nThe videotape wasn ’t real. Rather, it was a mental visualization of \nthe perfect race.

When \nBob Bowman started working with Phelps and his mother on the keystone habits of visualization and relaxation, neither Bowman nor Phelps had any idea what they were doing. “We’d experiment, try dif-ferent things until we found stuff that worked,” Bowman told me. “Eventually we ﬁ  gured out it was best to concentrate on these tiny \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   113 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   113 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n114 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nmoments of success and build them into mental triggers. We worked \nthem into a routine. There’s a series of things we do before every race that are designed to give Michael a sense of building victory.\n“If you were to ask Michael what’s going on in his head before \ncompetition, he would say he’s not really thinking about anything. He’s just following the program. But that’s not right. It’s more like his habits have taken over. When the race arrives, he’s more than halfway through his plan and he’s been victorious at every step. All the stretches went like he planned. The  warm- up laps were just like he visualized. His headphones are playing exactly what he expected. The actual race is just another step in a pattern that started earlier that day and has been nothing but victories. Winning is a natural extension.”\nBack in Beijing, it was 9:56 \nA.M.—four minutes before the race’s \n start— and Phelps stood behind his starting block, bouncing slightly on his toes. When the announcer said his name, Phelps stepped onto the block, as he always did before a race, and then stepped down, as he always did. He swung his arms three times, as he had before every race since he was twelve years old. He stepped up on the blocks again, got into his stance, and, when the gun sounded, le",

At eighteen strokes, he started anticipating the wall. He could hear the crowd roaring, but since he was blind, he had no idea if they were cheering for him or someone else. Nine-teen strokes, then twenty. It felt like he needed one more. That’s what the videotape in his head said. He made a  twenty- ﬁ  rst, huge \nstroke, glided with his arm outstretched, and touched the wall. He had timed it perfectly. When he ripped off his goggles and looked up at the scoreboard, it said “WR”—world  record— next to his name. He’d won another gold.\nAfter the race, a reporter asked what it had felt like to swim blind.“It felt like I imagined it would,” Phelps said. It was one addi-\ntional victory in a lifetime full of small wins.\n● ● ●\nSix months after Paul O’Neill became CEO of Alcoa, he got a tele-phone call in the middle of the night. A plant manager in Arizona was on the line, panicked, talking about how an extrusion press had stopped operating and one of the  workers— a young man who had joined the company a few weeks earlier, eager for the job because it offered health care for his pregnant  wife— had tried a repair. He had \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   115 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   115 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n116 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\njumped over a yellow safety wall surrounding the press and walked \nacross the pit. There was a piece of aluminum jammed into the hinge on a swinging  six- foot arm. The young man pulled on the aluminum scrap, removing it. The machine was ﬁ  xed. Behind him, \nthe arm restarted its arc, swinging toward his head. When it hit, the arm crushed his skull. He was killed instantly.\nFourteen hours later, O’Neill ordered all the plant’s  executives— as \nwell as Alcoa’s top ofﬁ  cers in  Pittsburgh— into an emergency meet-\ning. For much of the day, they painstakingly  re- created the accident with diagrams and by watching videotapes again and again. They identiﬁ  ed dozens of errors that had contributed to the death, includ-\ning two managers who had seen the man jump over the barrier but failed to stop him; a training program that hadn ’t emphasized to the man that he wouldn ’t",

But that meet-ing really shook everyone up. He was serious about this stuff, seri-ous enough that he would stay up nights worrying about some employee he’d never met.

Managers told employees not to be afraid to suggest proactive \nmaintenance, and rules were clariﬁ  ed so that no one would attempt \nunsafe repairs. The newfound vigilance resulted in a  short- term, noticeable decline in the injury rate. Alcoa experienced a small win.\nThen O’Neill pounced.“I want to congratulate everyone for bringing down the number \nof accidents, even just for two weeks,” he wrote in a memo that made its way through the entire company. “We shouldn ’t celebrate because we’ve followed the rules, or brought down a number. We should celebrate because we are saving lives.”\nWorkers made copies of the note and taped it to their lockers. \nSomeone painted a mural of O’Neill on one of the walls of a smelt-ing plant with a quote from the memo inscribed underneath. Just as Michael Phelps’s routines had nothing to do with swimming and everything to do with his success, so O’Neill’s efforts began snow-balling into changes that were unrelated to safety, but transforma-tive nonetheless.\n“I said to the hourly workers, ‘If your management doesn ’t follow \nup on safety issues, then call me at home, here’s my number,’” O’Neill told me. “Workers started calling, but they didn ’t want to talk about accidents. They wanted to talk about all these other great ideas.”\nThe Alcoa plant that manufactured aluminum siding for houses, \nfor instance, had been struggling for years because executives would try to anticipate popular colors and inevitably guess wrong. They would pay consultants millions of dollars to choose shades of paint and six months later, the warehouse would be overﬂ  owing with \n“sunburst yellow” and out of suddenly  in- demand “hunter green.” One day, a  low- level employee made a suggestion that quickly worked its way to the general manager: If they grouped all the paint-ing machines together, they could switch out the pigments faster and become more nimble in responding to shifts in customer de-mand. Within a year, proﬁ  ts on aluminum siding doubled.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   117 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   117 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n118 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nThe small wins that started with O’Neill’s focus on safety created \na climate in which all kinds of new ideas bubbled up.\n“It turns out this guy had been suggesting this painting idea for \na decade, but hadn ’t told anyone in management,” an Alcoa execu-tive told me. “Then he ﬁ  gures, since we keep on asking for safety \nrecommendations, why not tell them about this other idea?

We should celebrate because we are saving lives.”\nWorkers made copies of the note and taped it to their lockers. \nSomeone painted a mural of O’Neill on one of the walls of a smelt-ing plant with a quote from the memo inscribed underneath. Just as Michael Phelps’s routines had nothing to do with swimming and everything to do with his success, so O’Neill’s efforts began snow-balling into changes that were unrelated to safety, but transforma-tive nonetheless.\n“I said to the hourly workers, ‘If your management doesn ’t follow \nup on safety issues, then call me at home, here’s my number,’” O’Neill told me. “Workers started calling, but they didn ’t want to talk about accidents.

They would pay consultants millions of dollars to choose shades of paint and six months later, the warehouse would be overﬂ  owing with \n“sunburst yellow” and out of suddenly  in- demand “hunter green.” One day, a  low- level employee made a suggestion that quickly worked its way to the general manager: If they grouped all the paint-ing machines together, they could switch out the pigments faster and become more nimble in responding to shifts in customer de-mand.

Yet it had a higher infant mortality rate than most of Eu-rope and some parts of South America. Rural areas, in particular, saw a staggering number of babies die before their ﬁ  rst birthdays.\nO’Neill was tasked with ﬁ  guring out why. He asked other federal \nagencies to start analyzing infant mortality data, and each time someone came back with an answer, he’d ask another question, try-ing to get deeper, to understand the problem ’s root causes. When-ever someone came into O’Neill’s ofﬁ  ce with some discovery, O’Neill \nwould start interrogating them with new inquiries. He drove people crazy with his  never- ending push to learn more, to understand what was really  going on. (“I love Paul O’Neill, but you could not pay me \nenough to work for him again,” one ofﬁ  cial told me. “The man has \nnever encountered an answer he can ’t turn into another twenty hours of work.”)\nSome research, for instance, suggested that the biggest cause of \ninfant deaths was premature births. And the reason babies were born too early was that mothers suffered from malnourishment during pregnancy. So to lower infant mortality, improve mothers’ diets. Simple, right? But to stop malnourishment, women had to \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   118 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   118 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nKeystone Habits, or The Ballad of Paul O’Neill  ● 119\nimprove their diets before they became pregnant. Which meant the \ngovernment had to start educating women about nutrition before they became sexually active. Which meant ofﬁ  cials had to create nu-\ntrition curriculums inside high schools.\nHowever, when O’Neill began asking about how to create those \ncurriculums, he discovered that many high school teachers in rural areas didn ’t know enough basic biology to teach nutrition. So the government had to remake how teachers were getting educated in college, and give them a stronger grounding in biology so they could eventually teach nutrition to teenage girls, so those teenagers would eat better before they started having sex, and, eventually, be sufﬁ  -\nciently nourished when they had children.\nPoor teacher training, the ofﬁ  cials working with O’Neill ﬁ  nally \nﬁ gured out, was a root cause of high infant mortality. If you asked \ndoctors or public health ofﬁ  cials for a plan to ﬁ  ght infant deaths, \nnone of them would have suggested changing how teachers are trained. They wouldn ’t have known there was a link. However, by teaching college students about biology, you made it possible for them to eventually pass on that knowledge to teenagers, who started eating healthier, and years later give birth to stronger babies. Today, the U.S. infant mortality rate is 68 percent lower than when O’Neill started the job.\nO’Neill’s experiences with infant mortality illustrate the second \nway that keystone habits encourage change: by creating structures that help other habits to ﬂ  ourish. In the case of premature deaths, \nchanging collegiate curriculums for teachers started a chain reac-tion that eventually trickled down to how girls were educated in rural areas, and whether they were sufﬁ  ciently nourished when they \nbecame pregnant. And O’Neill’s habit of constantly pushing other bureaucrats to continue researching until they found a problem ’s root causes overhauled how the government thought about prob-lems like infant mortality.\nThe same thing can happen in people’s lives.

So the government had to remake how teachers were getting educated in college, and give them a stronger grounding in biology so they could eventually teach nutrition to teenage girls, so those teenagers would eat better before they started having sex, and, eventually, be sufﬁ  -\nciently nourished when they had children.\nPoor teacher training, the ofﬁ  cials working with O’Neill ﬁ  nally \nﬁ gured out, was a root cause of high infant mortality. If you asked \ndoctors or public health ofﬁ  cials for a plan to ﬁ  ght infant deaths, \nnone of them would have suggested changing how teachers are trained.

However, by teaching college students about biology, you made it possible for them to eventually pass on that knowledge to teenagers, who started eating healthier, and years later give birth to stronger babies. Today, the U.S. infant mortality rate is 68 percent lower than when O’Neill started the job.\nO’Neill’s experiences with infant mortality illustrate the second \nway that keystone habits encourage change: by creating structures that help other habits to ﬂ  ourish. In the case of premature deaths, \nchanging collegiate curriculums for teachers started a chain reac-tion that eventually trickled down to how girls were educated in rural areas, and whether they were sufﬁ  ciently nourished when they \nbecame pregnant. And O’Neill’s habit of constantly pushing other bureaucrats to continue researching until they found a problem ’s root causes overhauled how the government thought about prob-lems like infant mortality.\nThe same thing can happen in people’s lives.

Early on, O’Neill took the unusual step of order-ing Alcoa’s ofﬁ  ces around the world to link up in an electronic net-\nwork. This was in the early 1980s, when large, international networks weren ’t usually connected to people’s desktop computers. O’Neill justiﬁ  ed his order by arguing that it was essential to create a  real- time \nsafety data system that managers could use to share suggestions. As a result, Alcoa developed one of the ﬁ  rst genuinely worldwide corpo-\nrate email systems.\nO’Neill logged on every morning and sent messages to make \nsure everyone else was logged on as well. At ﬁ  rst, people used the \nnetwork primarily to discuss safety issues. Then, as email habits became more ingrained and comfortable, they started posting infor-mation on all kinds of other topics, such as local market conditions, sales quotas, and business problems.  High- ranking executives were required to send in a report every Friday, which anyone in the com-pany could read. A manager in Brazil used the network to send a colleague in New York data on changes in the price of",

O’Neill’s keystone  habit— worker  safety— had created a platform that encouraged another  practice— email— years ahead of competitors.\n● ● ●\nBy 1996, Paul O’Neill had been at Alcoa for almost a decade. His leadership had been studied by the Harvard Business School and the Kennedy School of Government. He was regularly mentioned as a potential commerce secretary or secretary of defense. His employ-ees and the unions gave him high marks. Under his watch, Alcoa’s stock price had risen more than 200 percent. He was, at last, a uni-versally acknowledged success.\nIn May of that year, at a shareholder meeting in downtown Pitts-\nburgh, a Benedictine nun stood up during the  question- and- answer session and accused O’Neill of lying. Sister Mary Margaret repre-sented a social advocacy group concerned about wages and condi-tions inside an Alcoa plant in Ciudad Acuña, Mexico. She said that while O’Neill extolled Alcoa’s safety measures, workers in Mexico were becoming sick because of dangerous fumes.\n“It’s untrue,” O’Neill told the room. On his laptop, he pulled up \nthe safety records from the Mexican plant. “See?” he said, showing the room its high scores on safety, environmental compliance, and employee satisfaction surveys. The executive in charge of the facil-ity, Robert Barton, was one of Alcoa’s most senior managers. He had been with the company for decades and was responsible for some of their largest partnerships. The nun said that the audience shouldn ’t trust O’Neill. She sat down.\nAfter the meeting, O’Neill asked her to come to his ofﬁ  ce.

No, she told him. To be safe, O’Neill \nasked the company’s head of human resources and general counsel to ﬂ y to Mexico to see what was going on.\nWhen the executives arrived, they poked through the Acuña \nplant’s records, and found reports of an incident that had never been sent to headquarters. A few months earlier, there had been a buildup of fumes within a building. It was a relatively minor event. The plant’s executive, Barton, had installed ventilators to remove the gases. The people who had become ill had fully recovered within a day or two.\nBut Barton had never reported the illnesses.When the executives returned to Pittsburgh and presented their \nﬁ ndings, O’Neill had a question.\n“Did Bob Barton know that people had gotten sick?”\n“We didn ’t meet with him,” they answered. “But, yeah, it’s pretty \nclear he knew.”\nTwo days later, Barton was ﬁ  red.\nThe exit shocked outsiders. Barton had been mentioned in arti-\ncles as one of the company’s most valuable executives. His depar-ture was a blow to important joint ventures.\nWithin Alcoa, however, no one was surprised. It was seen as an \ninevitable extension of the culture that O’Neill had built.\n“Barton ﬁ  red himself,” one of his colleagues told me. “There \nwasn ’t even a choice there.”\nThis is the ﬁ  nal way that keystone habits encourage widespread \nchange: by creating cultures where new values become ingrained. Keystone habits make tough  choices— such as ﬁ  ring a top  executive—\n easier, because when that person violates the culture, it’s clear they have to go.

Tons of people quit before the school year starts.\n“But I found this group of guys in the ﬁ  rst couple of days here, \nand we started this thing where, every morning, we get together to make sure everyone is feeling strong. I go to them if I’m feeling worried or down, and I know they’ll pump me back up. There’s only nine of us, and we call ourselves the musketeers. Without them, I don ’t think I would have lasted a month here.”\nCadets who are successful at West Point arrive at the school \narmed with habits of mental and physical discipline. Those assets, however, only carry you so far. To succeed, they need a keystone habit that creates a  culture— such as a daily gathering of  like- minded  friends— to help ﬁ  nd the strength to overcome obstacles.

At IBM, for instance, Lou Gerstner rebuilt the ﬁ  rm by initially con-\ncentrating on one keystone habit: IBM’s research and selling rou-tines. At the consulting ﬁ  rm McKinsey & Company, a culture of \ncontinuous improvement is created through a keystone habit of  wide- ranging internal critiques that are at the core of every assign-ment. Within Goldman Sachs, a keystone habit of risk assessment undergirds every decision.\nAnd at Alcoa, O’Neill’s legacy lives on. Even in his absence",
