But o nce you \nreally understand what it means, you'll probably ma ke fewer \nagreements. I know I did. I used to make a lot of t hem, just to win \npeople's approval. When I realized the price I was paying on the \nback end for not keeping those agreements, I became  a lot more \nconscious about the ones I made. One insurance exec utive I \nworked with described the major benefit he derived from imple- \nmenting this system: \"Previously I would just tell everyone, 'Sure, \nI'll do it,' because I didn't know how much I reall y had to do. Now \nthat I've got the inventory clear and complete, jus t to maintain my \nintegrity I have had to say, 'No, I can't do that, I'm sorry.' The \namazing thing is that instead of being upset with m y \nrefusal, everyone was impressed by my discipline!\" \nAnother client, an entrepreneur in the personal \ncoaching business, recently told me that making an \ninventory of his work had eliminated a huge amount \nof worry and stress from his life. The discipline o f \nputting everything he had his attention on into his\nin-basket caused him to reconsider what he really \nwanted to do anything about. If he wasn't willing to toss a note \nabout it into \"in,\" he just let it go! \nI consider that very mature thinking.

Invariably when yo u capture all \nthe open loops, little and big, and see them on a l ist in front of \nyou, some part of you will be inspired (or creative ly disgusted or \nintimidated enough) to go knock them off the list. \nWe all seem to be starved for a win. It's great to satisfy \nthat by giving yourself doable tasks you can start and finish \neasily. \nHave you ever completed something that wasn't initi ally on a \nlist, so you wrote it down and checked it off? Then  you know \nwhat I mean. \nThere's another issue here, however. How \nwould you feel if your list and your stack were \ntotally—and successfully—completed? You'd proba- \nbly be bouncing off the ceiling, full of creative e nergy. \nOf course, within three days, guess what you'd have ? \nRight—another list, and probably an even bigger \none! You'd feel so good about finishing all your st uff you'd likely \ntake on bigger, more ambitious things to do. \nNot only that, but if you have a boss, what do you think he or \n229 Out of the strain of \nthe doing, into the \npeace of the done. \n—-Julia Louis \nWoodruff \nIt's a lot easier \nto complete \nagreements when \nyou know what \nthey are. \nTHE POWER OF THE KEY PRINCIPLES  I  PART THREE \nshe is going to do, after noticing the high levels of competency \nand productivity you're demonstrating? Right again— give you \nmore things to do! It's the catch-22 of professiona l development: \nthe better you get, the better you'd better get. \nSo, since you're not going to significantly lower y our stan- \ndards, or stop creating more things to do, you'd be tter get com- \nfortable with the third option, if you want to keep  from stressing \nyourself out. \nRenegotiate Your Agreement \nSuppose I'd told you I would meet you Thursday at 4 :00 P.M., \nbut after I made the appointment, my world changed.  Now, given \nmy new priorities, I decide I'm not going to meet you Thursday \nat four. But instead of simply not showing up, what  had I better \ndo, to maintain the integrity of the relationship? Correct—call \nand change the agreement. A renegotiated agreement is not a \nbroken one. \nDo you understand yet why getting all your \nstuff out of your head and in front of you makes yo u \nfeel better? Because you automatically renegotiate \nyour agreements with yourself when you look at \nthem, think about them, and either act on them that\nvery moment or say, \"No, not now.\" Here's the prob-\nlem: it's impossible to renegotiate agreements with\nyourself that you can't remember you made! \nThe fact that you can't remember an agreement \nyou made with yourself doesn't mean that you're not\nholding yourself liable for it. Ask any psychologis t \nhow much of a sense of past and future that part of  your psyche \nhas, the part that was storing the list you dumped:  zero. It's all \npresent tense in there. That means that as soon as you tell yourself \nthat you should do something, if you file it only i n your short- \nterm memory, there's a part of you that thinks you should be \ndoing it all the time. And that means that as soon as you've given \nyourself two things to do, and filed them only in y our head, \n230 It  is the act of \nforgiveness that \nopens up the only \npossible way to \nthink creatively \nabout the future at \nall. \n—\nFather \nCHAPTER 11   I  THE POWER OF THE COLLECTION HABIT \nyou've created instant and automatic stress and fai lure, because \nyou can't do them both at the same time. \nIf you're like most people, you've probably got som e storage \narea at home—maybe a garage that you told yourself a while back \n(maybe even six years ago!) you ought to clean and organize. If so, \nthere's a part of you that likely thinks you should 've been cleaning \nyour garage twenty-four hours a day for the past si x years! No \nwonder people are so tired! And have you heard that  little voice \ninside your own mental committee every time you wal k by your \ngarage? \"Why are we walking by the garage?! Aren't we supposed \nto be cleaning it!?\" Because you can't stand that w hining, nagging \npart of yourself, you never even go in the garage a nymore if you \ncan help it. If",

But in my experience that's inaccurate, at le ast in terms of \nhow a less-than-conscious part of us operates. It is how our con- \nscious mind operates, however, so every agreement m ust be made \nconscious. That means it must be captured, objectif ied, and \nreviewed regularly in full conscious awareness so t hat you can put \nit where it belongs in your self-management arena. If that doesn't \nhappen, it will actually take up a lot more psychic  energy than it \ndeserves. \nIn my experience, anything that is held only in \"ps ychic \nRAM\" will take up either more or less attention tha n it deserves. \nThe reason to collect everything is not that everyt hing is equally \nimportant, it's that it's not. Incompletions, uncollected, take on a \ndull sameness in the sense of the pressure they cre ate and the \nattention they tie up. \nHow Much Collection Is Required? \nYou'll feel better collecting anything that you haven't collected yet. \nWhen you say to yourself, \"Oh, that's right, I need  to get butter \nnext time I'm at the store,\" and you write it on yo ur grocery list, \nyou'll feel better. When you remember, \"I've got to  call my banker \nabout the trust fund,\" and you write that down some place where \nyou know you'll see it when you're at a phone, you' ll feel better. \nBut there will be a light-year's difference when yo u know you \nhave it all. \nWhen will you know how much you have left in your h ead to \ncollect? Only when there's nothing left. If some pa rt of you is even \nvaguely aware that you don't have it all, you can't  really know what \npercentage you have collected. How will you know wh en there's \nnothing left? When nothing else shows up as a remin der in your \nmind. \nThis doesn't mean that your mind will be empty. If you're \nconscious, your mind will always be focusing on som ething. But if \nit's focusing on only one thing at a time, without distraction, \nyou'll be in your \"zone.\" \nCHAPTER 11   I  THE POWER OF THE COLLECTION HABIT \nI suggest that you use your mind to think about things, rather \nthan think of them. You want to be adding value as you think \nabout projects and people, not simply reminding you rself they \nexist. To fully realize that more productive place,  you will need to \ncapture it all. It takes focus and a change of habi t to train yourself \nto recognize and download even the smallest agreeme nts with \nyourself as they're created in your mind. Doing the  collection \nprocess as fully as you can, and then incorporating  the behavior of \ncapturing all the new things as they emerge, will b e empowering \nand productive. \nWhen Relationships and Organizations \nHave the Collection Habit \nWhat happens when everyone involved on",
