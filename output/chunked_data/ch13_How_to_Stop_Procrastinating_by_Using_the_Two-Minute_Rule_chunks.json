This is why\nmastering the decisive moments throughout your day is so\nimportant. Each day is made up of many moments, but it is\nreally a few habitual choices that determine the path you\ntake. These little choices stack up, each one setting the\ntrajectory for how you spend the next chunk of time.\nHabits are the entry point, not the end point. They are\nthe cab, not the gym.\nTHE TWO -MINUTE RULE\nEven when you know you should start small, it’s easy to\nstart too big. When you dream about making a change,\nexcitement inevitably takes over and you end up trying to\ndo too much too soon. The most eﬀective way I know to\ncounteract this tendency is to use the  Two-Minute Rule ,\nwhich states, “ When you start a new habit, it should take\nless than two minutes to do .”\nYou’ll ﬁnd that nearly any habit can be scaled down into\na two-minute version:\n“Read before bed each night” becomes “Read one\npage.”\n“Do thirty minutes of yoga” becomes “T ake out my\nyoga mat.”\n“Study for class” becomes “Open my notes.”\n“Fold the laundry” becomes “F old one pair of socks.”\n“Run three miles” becomes “Tie my running shoes.”\nThe idea is to make your habits as easy as possible to\nstart. Anyone can meditate for one minute, read one page,\nor put one item of clothing away . And, as we have just\ndiscussed, this is a powerful strategy because once you’ve\nstarted doing the right thing, it is much easier to continue\ndoing it. A new habit should not feel like a challenge.

Y ou know that the real goal is to do more than just\ntwo minutes, so it may feel like you’re trying to fool\nyourself . Nobody is actually aspiring to read one page or do\none push-up or open their notes. And if you know it’s a\nmental trick, why would you fall for it?\nIf the T wo-Minute Rule feels forced, try this: do it for two\nminutes and then stop. Go for a run, but you must  stop\nafter two minutes. Start meditating, but you must  stop after\ntwo minutes. Study Arabic, but you must  stop after two\nminutes. It’s not a strategy for starting, it’s the whole\nthing. Y our habit can only last one hundred and twenty\nseconds.\nOne of my readers used this strategy to lose over one\nhundred pounds. In the beginning, he went to the gym each\nday, but he told himself he wasn’t allowed to stay for more\nthan ﬁve minutes. He would go to the gym, exercise for ﬁve\nminutes, and leave as soon as his time was up. A fter a few\nweeks, he looked around and thought, “ Well, I’m always\ncoming here anyway . I might as well start staying a little\nlonger .” A few years later , the weight was gone.\nJournaling provides another example. Nearly everyone\ncan beneﬁt from getting their thoughts out of their head\nand onto paper , but most people give up after a few days or\navoid it entirely because journaling feels like a chore. * The\nsecret is to always stay below the point where it feels like\nwork. Greg McK eown, a leadership consultant from the\nUnited Kingdom, built a daily journaling habit by\nspeciﬁcally writing less than he felt like. He always stopped\njournaling before it seemed like a hassle. Ernest\nHemingway believed in similar advice for any kind of\nwriting. “The best way is to always stop when you are\ngoing good,” he said.\nStrategies like this work for another reason, too: they\nreinforce the identity you want to build. If you show up at\nthe gym ﬁve days in a row—even if it’s just for two minutes\n—you are casting votes for your new identity . You’re not\nworried about getting in shape. Y ou’re focused on\nbecoming the type of person who doesn’t miss workouts.\nYou’re taking the smallest action that conﬁrms the type of\nperson you want to be.\nWe rarely think about change this way because everyone\nis consumed by the end goal. But one push-up is better\nthan not exercising. One minute of guitar practice is better\nthan none at all. One minute of reading is better than never\npicking up a book. It’s better to do less than you hoped\nthan to do nothing at all.\nAt some point, once you’ve established the habit and\nyou’re showing up each day , you can combine the T wo-\nMinute Rule with a technique we call habit shaping  to scale\nyour habit back up toward your ultimate goal. Start by\nmastering the ﬁrst two minutes of the smallest version of\nthe behavior . Then, advance to an intermediate step and\nrepeat the process—focusing on just the ﬁrst two minutes\nand mastering that stage before moving on to the next\nlevel.
