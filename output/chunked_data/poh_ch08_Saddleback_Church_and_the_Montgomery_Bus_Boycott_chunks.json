The bus was crowded and, by law, the ﬁ  rst four rows were reserved for white passengers. \nThe area where blacks were allowed to sit, in the back, was already full and so the  woman— Rosa  Parks— sat in a center row, right be-hind the white section, where either race could claim a seat.\nAs the bus continued on its route, more people boarded. Soon, \nall the rows were ﬁ  lled and some— including a white  passenger— \nwere standing in the aisle, holding on to an overhead bar. The bus driver, James F.

She wasn ’t in the white section, she \ntold the driver, and besides, there was only one white rider standing.\n“If you don ’t stand up,” Blake said, “I’m going to call the police \nand have you arrested.”\n“You may do that,” Parks said.The driver left and found two policemen.“Why don ’t you stand up?” one of them asked Parks after they \nboarded.\n“Why do you push us around?” she said.“I don ’t know,” the ofﬁ  cer answered. “But the law is the law and \nyou’re under arrest.”\nAt that moment, though no one on that bus knew it, the civil \nrights movement pivoted. That small refusal was the ﬁ  rst in a series \nof actions that shifted the battle over race relations from a struggle fought by activists in courts and legislatures into a contest that would draw its strength from entire communities and mass pro-tests. Over the next year, Montgomery’s black population would rise up and boycott the city’s buses, ending their strike only once the law segregating races on public transportation was stricken from the books. The boycott would ﬁ  nancially cripple the bus line, draw tens \nof thousands of protesters to rallies, introduce the country to a char-ismatic young leader named Martin Luther King, Jr., and spark a movement that would spread to Little Rock, Greensboro, Raleigh, Birmingham, and, eventually, to Congress.

And the reason why social habits have such inﬂ  uence is because at \nthe root of many  movements— be they  large- scale revolutions or sim-ple ﬂ uctuations in the churches people  attend— is a  three- part pro-\ncess that historians and sociologists say shows up again and again:\nA movement starts because of the social habits of friendship and \nthe strong ties between close acquaintances.\nIt grows because of the habits of a community, and the weak ties \nthat hold neighborhoods and clans together.\nAnd it endures because a movement’s leaders give participants \nnew habits that create a fresh sense of identity and a feeling of own-ership.\nUsually, only when all three parts of this process are fulﬁ  lled can \na movement become  self- propelling and reach a critical mass.

She wasn ’t even the ﬁ  rst that year. In \n1946, Geneva Johnson had been arrested for talking back to a Mont-gomery bus driver over seating. In 1949, Viola White, Katie Wing-ﬁ eld, and two black children were arrested for sitting in the white \nsection and refusing to move. That same year, two black teenagers visiting from New  Jersey— where buses were  integrated— were ar-rested and jailed after breaking the law by sitting next to a white man and a boy. In 1952, a Montgomery policeman shot and killed a black man when he argued with a bus driver. In 1955, just months before Parks was taken to jail, Claudette Colvin and Mary Louise Smith were arrested in separate incidents for refusing to give their seats to white passengers.\nNone of those arrests resulted in boycotts or protests, however. \n“There weren ’t many real activists in Montgomery at the time,” Tay-lor Branch, the Pulitzer Prize–winning civil rights historian, told me. “People didn ’t mount protests or marches. Activism was some-thing that happened in courts. It wasn ’t something average people did.”\nWhen a young Martin Luther King, Jr., arrived in Montgomery in \n1954, for instance, a year before Parks’s arrest he found a majority of the city’s blacks accepted segregation “without apparent protest. Not only did they seem resigned to segregation per se; they also ac-cepted the abuses and indignities which came with it.”\nSo why, when Parks was arrested, did things change?One explanation is that the political climate was shifting. The \nprevious year, the U.S. Supreme Court had handed down Brown v. \nBoard of Education,  ruling that segregation was illegal within public \nschools; six months before Parks’s arrest, the Court had issued what came to be known as Brown  II— a decision ordering that school in-\ntegration must proceed with “all deliberate speed.” There was a powerful sense across the nation that change was in the air.\nBut that isn ’t sufﬁ  cient to explain why Montgomery became \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   218 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   218 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nSaddleback Church and the Montgomery Bus Boycott ● 219\nground zero for the civil rights struggle.

Montgomery wasn ’t Atlanta or Austin or other cities where progress seemed pos-sible. “Montgomery was a pretty nasty place,” Branch said. “Racism was set in its ways there.”\nWhen Parks was arrested, however, it sparked something un-\nusual within the city. Rosa Parks, unlike other people who had been jailed for violating the bus segregation law, was deeply respected and embedded within her community. So when she was arrested, it triggered a series of social  habits— the habits of  friendship— that ignited an initial protest. Parks’s membership in dozens of social networks across Montgomery allowed her friends to muster a re-sponse before the community’s normal apathy could take hold.\nMontgomery’s civil life, at the time, was dominated by hundreds \nof small groups that created the city’s social fabric. The city’s Direc-\ntory of Civil and Social Organizations  was almost as thick as its phone \nbook. Every adult, it  seemed— particularly every black  adult— belonged to some kind of club, church, social group, community center, or neighborhood organization, and often more than one. And within these social networks, Rosa Parks was particularly well known and liked. “Rosa Parks was one of those rare people of whom everyone agreed that she gave more than she got,” Branch wrote in his history of the civil rights movement, Parting the Waters . “Her \ncharacter represented one of the isolated high blips on the graph of human nature, offsetting a dozen or so sociopaths.” Parks’s many friendships and afﬁ  liations cut across the city’s racial and economic \nlines. She was the secretary of the local NAACP chapter, attended the Methodist church, and helped oversee a youth organization at the Lutheran church near her home. She spent some weekends vol-unteering at a shelter, others with a botanical club, and on Wednes-\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   219 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   219 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n220 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nday nights often joined a group of women who knit blankets for a \nlocal hospital.

They’d been looking for the perfect case to challenge Montgomery’s bus segregation laws, and sensing an opportunity, they asked Parks if she would be willing to let them ﬁ  ght her arrest \nin court. Parks’s husband was opposed to the idea. “The white folks will kill you, Rosa,” he told her.\nBut Parks had spent years working with Nixon at the NAACP. \nShe had been in Durr’s house and had helped his daughters prepare for cotillions. Her friends were now asking her for a favor.\n“If you think it will mean something to Montgomery and do \nsome good,” she told them, “I’ll be happy to go along with it.”\nThat  night— just a few hours after the  arrest— news of Parks’s \njailing began to ﬁ  lter through the black community. Jo Ann Robin-\nson, the president of a powerful political group of schoolteachers and a friend of Parks’s from numerous organizations, heard about it. So did many of the schoolteachers in Robinson ’s group, and many of the parents of their students. Close to midnight, Robinson called an impromptu meeting and suggested that everyone boycott the city’s buses on Monday, four days hence, when Parks was to appear in court.\nAfterward, Robinson snuck into her ofﬁ  ce’s mimeograph room \nand made copies of a ﬂ  yer.\n“ Another Negro woman has been arrested and thrown into jail \nbecause she refused to get up out of her seat on the bus for a white person to sit down,” it read. “This woman ’s case will come up on Monday. We are, therefore, asking every Negro to stay off the buses Monday in protest of the arrest and trial.”\nEarly the next morning, Robinson gave stacks of the ﬂ  yers to \nschoolteachers and asked them to distribute it to parents and co-workers. Within  twenty- four hours of Parks’s arrest, word of her jailing and the boycott had spread to some of the city’s most inﬂ  uen-\ntial  communities— the local NAACP, a large political group, a num-ber of black schoolteachers, and the parents of their students. Many \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   221 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   221 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n222 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nof the people who received a ﬂ  yer knew Rosa Parks  personally— they \nhad sat next to her in church or at a volunteer meeting and consid-ered her a friend. There’s a natural instinct embedded in friendship, a sympathy that makes us willing to ﬁ  ght for someone we like when \nthey are treated unjustly. Studies show that people have no prob-lems ignoring strangers’ injuries, but when a friend is insulted, our sense of outrage is enough to overcome the inertia that usually makes protests hard to organize. When Parks’s friends learned about her arrest and the boycott, the social habits of  friendship— the natural inclination to help someone we  respect— kicked in.\nThe ﬁ  rst mass movement of the modern civil rights era could \nhave been sparked by any number of earlier arrests. But it began with Rosa Parks because she had a large, diverse, and connected set of  friends— who, when she was arrested, reacted as friends natu-rally respond, by following the social habits of friendship and agree-ing to show their support.\nStill, many expected the protest would be nothing more than a \n one- day event. Small protests pop up every day around the world, and almost all of them quickly ﬁ  zzle out.

You belong to a church, a gym, and a country club, as well as the local chapter of your college alumni association. You’re respected and often asked to join various committees. When people within your community hear of a business opportunity, they often pass it your way.\nNow imagine you get a phone call. It’s a midlevel executive at \nanother company looking for a new job. Will you help him by put-ting in a good word with your boss, he asks?\nIf the person on the telephone is a total stranger, it’s an easy deci-\nsion. Why risk your standing inside your ﬁ  rm helping someone you \ndon ’t know?\nIf the person on the phone is a close friend, on the other hand, \nit’s also an easy choice. Of course you’ll help. That’s what friends do.\nHowever, what if the person on the phone isn ’t a good friend or a \nstranger, but something in between? What if you have friends in common, but don ’t know each other very well? Do you vouch for the caller when your boss asks if he’s worth an interview? How much of your own reputation and energy, in other words, are you willing to expend to help a friend of a friend get a job?\nIn the late 1960s, a Harvard PhD student named Mark Granovet-\nter set out to answer that question by studying how 282 men had found their current employment. He tracked how they had learned about open positions, whom they had called for referrals, the meth-ods they used to land interviews, and most important, who had pro-vided a helping hand. As expected, he found that when job hunters approached strangers for assistance, they were rejected. When they appealed to friends, help was provided.\nMore surprising, however, was how often job hunters also  re-\nceived help from casual  acquaintances— friends of  friends— people who were neither strangers nor close pals. Granovetter called those connections “weak ties,” because they represented the links that connect people who have acquaintances in common, who share \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   223 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   223 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n224 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nmembership in social networks, but aren ’t directly connected by the \nstrong ties of friendship themselves.\nIn fact, in landing a job, Granovetter discovered,  weak- tie acquain-\ntances were often more  important than  strong- tie friends because \nweak ties give us access to social networks where we don ’t otherwise belong. Many of the people Granovetter studied had learned  about \nnew job opportunities through weak ties, rather than from close friends, which makes sense because we talk to our closest friends all the time, or work alongside them or read the same blogs. By the time they have heard about a new opportunity, we probably know about it, as well. On the other hand, our  weak- tie  acquaintances— the people we bump into every six  months— are the ones who tell us about jobs we would otherwise never hear about.\nWhen sociologists have examined how opinions move through \ncommunities, how gossip spreads or political movements start, they’ve discovered a common pattern: Our  weak- tie acquaintances are often as  inﬂ  uential— if not  more— than our  close- tie friends. As \nGranovetter wrote, “Individuals with few weak ties will be deprived of information from distant parts of the social system and will be conﬁ ned to the provincial news and views of their close friends. \nThis deprivation will not only insulate them from the latest ideas and fashions but may put them in a disadvantaged position in the labor market, where advancement can depend . . . on knowing about appropriate job openings at just the right time.\n“Furthermore, such individuals may be difﬁ  cult to organize or \nintegrate into political movements of any kind. . . . While members of one or two cliques may be efﬁ  ciently recruited, the problem is \nthat, without weak ties, any momentum generated in this way does not spread beyond the clique. As a result, most of the population will \nbe untouched.”\nThe power of weak",

Most people don ’t care enough about the latest outrage to give up their bus ride or caffeine unless it’s a close friend that has been insulted or jailed. So there is a tool that activists have long relied upon to compel protest, even when a group of people don ’t necessarily want to participate. It’s a form of persuasion that \nhas been remarkably effective over hundreds of years. It’s the sense of obligation that neighborhoods or communities place upon them-selves.\nIn other words, peer pressure.Peer  pressure— and the social habits that encourage people to \nconform to group  expectations— is difﬁ  cult to describe, because it \nso often differs in form and expression from person to person. These social habits aren ’t so much one consistent pattern as dozens of individual habits that ultimately cause everyone to move in the same direction.\nThe habits of peer pressure, however, have something in com-\nmon. They often spread through weak ties. And they gain their au-thority through communal expectations. If you ignore the social obligations of your neighborhood, if you shrug off the expected pat-terns of your community, you risk losing your social standing. You endanger your access to many of the social beneﬁ  ts that come from \njoining the country club, the alumni association, or the church in the ﬁ rst place.\nIn other words, if you don ’t give the caller looking for a job a \nhelping hand, he might complain to his tennis partner, who might mention those grumblings to someone in the locker room who you were hoping to attract as a client, who is now less likely to return your call because you have a reputation for not being a team player. On a playground, peer pressure is dangerous. In adult life, it’s how business gets done and communities  self- organize.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   225 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   225 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n226 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nSuch peer pressure, on its own, isn ’t enough to sustain a move-\nment. But when the strong ties of friendship and the weak ties of peer pressure merge, they create incredible momentum. That’s when widespread social change can begin.\n● ● ●\nTo see how the combination of strong and weak ties can propel a movement, fast forward to nine years after Rosa Parks’s arrest, when \nhundreds of young people volunteered to expose themselves to deadly risks for the civil rights crusade.\nIn 1964, students from across the  country— many of them whites \nfrom Harvard, Yale, and other northern  universities— applied for something called the “Mississippi Summer Project.” It was a  ten- week program devoted to registering black voters in the South. The project came to be known as Freedom Summer, and many who applied were aware it would be dangerous. In the months before the program started, newspapers and magazines were ﬁ  lled with arti-\ncles predicting violence (which proved tragically accurate when, just a week after it began, white vigilantes killed three volunteers outside Longdale, Mississippi). The threat of harm kept many students from participating in the Mississippi Summer Project, even after they applied. More than a thousand applicants were accepted into Freedom Summer, but when it came time to head south in June, more than three hundred of those invited to participate decided to stay home.\nIn the 1980s, a sociologist at the University of Arizona named \nDoug McAdam began wondering if it was possible to ﬁ  gure out why \nsome people had participated in Freedom Summer and others with-drew. He started by reading 720 of the applications students had submitted decades earlier. Each was ﬁ  ve pages long. Applicants \nwere",

To test this idea, he divided applicants into two groups. The ﬁ  rst pile \nwere people who said they wanted to go to Mississippi for  “self- interested” motives, such as to “test myself,” to “be where the action is,” or to “learn about the southern way of life.” The second group were those with  “other- oriented” motives, such as to “improve the lot of blacks,” to “aid in the full realization of democracy,” or to “demonstrate the power of nonviolence as a vehicle for social change.”\nThe  self- centered, McAdam hypothesized, would be more likely \nto stay home once they realized the risks of Freedom Summer.

Maybe \nthose who stayed home had husbands or girlfriends keeping them from going to Mississippi? Maybe they had graduated and had got-ten jobs, and couldn ’t swing a  two- month unpaid break?\nWrong again.“Being married or holding a  full- time job actually enhanced the \napplicant’s chances of going south,” McAdam concluded.\nHe had one hypothesis left. Each applicant was asked to list their \nmemberships in student and political organizations and at least ten people they wanted kept informed of their summer activities, so McAdam took these lists and used them to chart each applicant’s \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   227 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   227 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n228 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nsocial network. By comparing memberships in clubs, he was able to \ndetermine which applicants had friends who also  applied for Free-\ndom Summer.\nOnce he ﬁ  nished, he ﬁ  nally had an answer as to why some stu-\ndents went to Mississippi, and others stayed home: because of so-cial  habits— or more speciﬁ  cally, because of the power of strong and \nweak ties working in tandem. The students who participated in Freedom Summer were enmeshed in the types of communities where both their close friends and their casual acquaintances ex-\npected them to get on the bus. Those who withdrew were also en-meshed in communities, but of a different  kind— the kind where the social pressures and habits didn ’t compel them to go to Missis-sippi.\n“Imagine you’re one of the students who applied,” McAdam told \nme. “On the day you signed up for Freedom Summer, you ﬁ  lled out \nthe application with ﬁ  ve of your closest friends and you were all feel-\ning really motivated.\n“Now, it’s six months later and departure day is almost here. All \nthe magazines are predicting violence in Mississippi. You called your parents, and they told you to stay at home. It would be strange, at that point, if you weren ’t having second thoughts.\n“Then, you’re walking across campus and you see a bunch of \npeople from your church group, and they say, ‘We’re coordinating  rides— when should we pick you up?’ These people aren ’t your clos-est friends, but you see them at club meetings and in the dorm, and they’re important within your social community. They all know you’ve been accepted to Freedom Summer, and that you’ve said you want to go.",

At the time, King was  twenty- six years old. He had been in Montgomery for only a year and was still trying to ﬁ  gure out his role within the community. Nixon was ask-\ning for King’s endorsement as well as permission to use his church for a boycott meeting that night. King was wary of getting too deeply involved. “Brother Nixon,” he said, “let me think about it and you call me back.”\nBut Nixon didn ’t stop there. He reached out to one of King’s clos-\nest  friends— one of the strongest of King’s strong  ties— named Ralph D. Abernathy, and asked him to help convince the young minister to participate. A few hours later, Nixon called King again.\n“I’ll go along with it,” King told him.“I’m glad to hear you say so,” Nixon said, “because I’ve talked to \neighteen other people and told them to meet in your church tonight. It would have been kind of bad to be getting together there without you.” Soon, King was drafted into serving as president of the orga-nization that had sprung up to coordinate the boycott.\nOn Sunday, three days after Parks’s arrest, the city’s black \n ministers— after speaking to King and other members of the new  organization— explained to their congregations that every black church in the city had agreed to a  one- day protest. The message was clear: It would be embarrassing for any parishioner to sit on the sidelines. That same day, the town ’s newspaper, the",

Others didn ’t know Parks, but they could sense the community was rallying behind her cause, and that if they were seen riding a bus on Monday, it would look bad. “If you work,” read a ﬂ  yer handed out in churches, “take a cab, or share a ride, or \nwalk.” Then everyone heard that the boycott’s leaders had  convinced— or  strong- armed— all the black taxi drivers into agree-ing to carry black passengers on Monday for ten cents a ride, the same as a bus fare. The community’s weak ties were drawing every-one together. At that point, you were either with the boycott or against it.\nOn the Monday morning of the boycott, King woke before dawn \nand got his coffee. His wife, Coretta, sat at the front window and waited for the ﬁ  rst bus to pass. She shouted when she saw the head-\nlights of the South Jackson line, normally ﬁ  lled with maids on their \nway to work, roll by with no passengers. The next bus was empty as well. And the one that came after. King got into his car and started driving around, checking other routes. In an hour, he counted eight black passengers. One week earlier, he would have seen hundreds.\n“I was jubilant,” he later wrote. “ A miracle had taken place. . . . \nMen were seen riding mules to work, and more than one  horse- drawn buggy drove the streets of Montgomery. . . . Spectators had gathered at the bus stops to watch what was happening. At ﬁ  rst, they stood \nquietly, but as the day progressed they began to cheer the empty buses and laugh and make jokes. Noisy youngsters could be heard singing out, ‘No riders today.’”\nThat afternoon, in a courtroom on Church Street, Rosa Parks \nwas found guilty of violating the state’s segregation laws. More than ﬁ ve hundred blacks crowded the hallways and stood in front of the \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   231 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   231 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n232 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nbuilding, awaiting the verdict. The boycott and impromptu rally at \nthe courthouse were the most signiﬁ  cant black political activism in \nMontgomery’s history, and it had all come together in ﬁ  ve days. It \nhad started among Parks’s close friends, but it drew its power, King and other participants later said, because of a sense of obligation among the  community— the social habits of weak ties. The commu-nity was pressured to stand together for fear that anyone who didn ’t participate wasn ’t someone you wanted to be friends with in the ﬁ  rst \nplace.\nThere are plenty of people who would have participated in the \nboycott without such encouragement. King and the cabbies and the congregations might have made the same choices without the inﬂ  u-\nence of strong and weak ties. But tens of thousands of people from across the city would not have decided to stay off the buses without the encouragement of social habits. “The once dormant and quies-cent Negro community was now fully awake",

The community’s weak ties were drawing every-one together. At that point, you were either with the boycott or against it.\nOn the Monday morning of the boycott,",

He wanted to start a new congregation among people who didn ’t already attend church, but he had no idea where it should be located. “I ﬁ  gured I would go somewhere all my \nseminary friends didn ’t want to go,” he told me. He spent the sum-mer in libraries studying census records, phone books, newspaper articles, and maps. His wife was in her ninth month, and so every few hours Warren would jog to a pay phone, call home to make sure she hadn ’t started labor yet, and then return to the stacks.\nOne afternoon, Warren stumbled upon a description of a place \ncalled Saddleback Valley in Orange County, California. The book War-ren was reading said it was the fastest-growing region in the fastest growing county in one of the fastest-growing states in America. There were a number of churches in the area, but none large enough to ac-commodate the quickly expanding population. Intrigued, Warren contacted religious leaders in Southern California who told him that many locals  self- identiﬁ  ed as Christian but didn ’t attend services. “In \nthe dusty, dimly lit basement of that university library, I heard God speak to me: ‘That’s where I want you to plant a church!’” Warren later wrote. “From that moment on, our destination was a settled issue.”\nWarren ’s focus on building a congregation among the un-\nchurched had begun ﬁ  ve years earlier, when, as a missionary in \nJapan, he had discovered an old copy of a Christian magazine with an article headlined “Why Is This Man Dangerous?” It was about Donald McGavran, a controversial author focused on building churches in nations where most people hadn ’t accepted Christ. At the center of McGavran ’s philosophy was an admonition that mis-sionaries should imitate the tactics of other successful  movements— including the civil rights  campaign— by appealing to people’s social habits. “The steady goal must be the Christianization of the entire fabric which is the people, or large enough parts of it that the social \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   233 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   233 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n234 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nlife of the individual is not destroyed,” McGavran had written in one \nof his books. Only the evangelist who helps people “to become fol-lowers of Christ in their normal social relationship has any chance of \nliberating multitudes.”\nThat  article— and, later, McGavran ’s  books— were a revelation to \nRick Warren. Here, ﬁ  nally, was someone applying a rational logic to \na topic that was usually couched in the language of miracles and revelations. Here was someone who understood that religion had to be, for lack of a better word, marketed.\nMcGavran laid out a strategy that instructed church builders to \nspeak to people in their",

People follow \nChrist not because you’ve led them there, but because it’s who they are.”\n● ● ●\nWhen Warren ﬁ  rst arrived in Saddleback Valley, he spent twelve \nweeks going  door- to- door, introducing himself and asking strangers why they didn ’t go to church. Many of the answers were  practical— it \nwas boring, people said, the music was bad, the sermons didn ’t seem applicable to their lives, they needed child care, they hated dressing up, the pews were uncomfortable.\nWarren ’s church would address each of those complaints. He \ntold people to wear shorts and Hawaiian shirts, if they felt like it. An electric guitar was brought in. Warren ’s sermons, from the start, focused on practical topics, with titles such as “How to Handle Dis-couragement,” “How to Feel Good About Yourself,” “How to Raise Healthy Families,” and “How to Survive Under Stress.” His lessons were easy to understand, focused on real, daily problems, and could be applied as soon as parishioners left church.\nIt started to work. Warren rented school auditoriums for services \nand ofﬁ  ce buildings for prayer meetings. The congregation hit ﬁ  fty \nmembers, then one hundred, then two hundred in less than a year. Warren was working eighteen hours a day, seven days a week, an-swering congregants’ phone calls, leading classes, coming to their homes to offer marriage counseling, and, in his spare time, always looking for new venues to accommodate the church ’s growing size.\nOne Sunday in  mid- December, Warren stood up to preach dur-\ning the eleven o’clock service. He felt light-headed, dizzy. He gripped \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   235 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   235 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n236 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nthe podium and started to speak, but the words on the page were \nblurry. He began to fall, caught himself, and motioned to the assis-tant  pastor— his only  staff— to take the lectern.\n“I’m sorry, folks,” Warren told the audience. “I’m going to have \nto sit down.”\nFor years, he had suffered from anxiety attacks",

But it had never hit this bad before. The next day, Warren and his family began driving to Arizona, where his wife’s family had a house. Slowly, he recuperated. Some days, he would sleep for twelve hours and then take a walk through the desert, praying, trying to understand why these panic attacks were threatening to undo every-thing he had worked so hard to build. Nearly a month passed as he stayed away from the church. His melancholy became a  full- ﬂ  edged \ndepression, darker than anything he had experienced before. He wasn ’t certain if he would ever become healthy enough to return.\nWarren, as beﬁ  tting a pastor, is a man prone to epiphanies.

He was never certain he would \nhave enough classrooms to accommodate everyone who showed up for Bible study, so he had asked a few church members to host classes inside their homes. He worried that people might complain about going to someone’s house, rather than a proper church classroom. But congregants loved it, they said. The small groups gave them a chance to meet their neighbors. So, after he returned from his leave, Warren assigned every Saddleback member to a small group that met every week. It was one of the most important decisions he ever made, because it transformed church participation from a decision into a habit that drew on  already- existing social urges and patterns.\n“Now, when people come to Saddleback and see the giant crowds \non the weekends, they think that’s our success,” Warren told me. “But that’s just the tip of the iceberg.  Ninety- ﬁ  ve percent of this \nchurch is what happens during the week inside those small groups.\n“The congregation and the small groups are like a  one- two \npunch. You have this big crowd to remind you why you’re doing this in the ﬁ  rst place, and a small group of close friends to help you \nfocus on how to be faithful. Together, they’re like glue. We have over ﬁ ve thousand small groups now. It’s the only thing that makes a \nchurch this size manageable. Otherwise, I’d work myself to death, and 95 percent of the congregation would never receive the atten-tion they came here looking for.”\nWithout realizing it, Warren, in some ways, has replicated the \nstructure that propelled the Montgomery bus  boycott— though he has done it in reverse. That boycott started among people who knew Rosa Parks, and became a mass protest when the weak toes of the community compelled participation. At Saddleback Church, it works the other way around. People are attracted by a sense of com-munity and the weak ties that a congregation offers. Then once in-side, they’re pushed into a small group of  neighbors— a petri dish, if you will, for growing close  ties— where their faith becomes an aspect of their social experience and daily lives.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   237 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   237 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n238 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nCreating small groups, however, isn ’t enough.

When Warren \nasked people what they discussed in one another’s living rooms, he discovered they talked about the Bible and prayed together for ten minutes, and then spent the rest of the time discussing kids or gos-siping. Warren ’s goal, however, wasn ’t just to help people make new friends. It was to build a community of the faithful, to encourage people to accept the lessons of Christ, and to make faith a focus of their lives. His small groups had created tight bonds, but without leadership, they weren ’t much more than a coffee circle. They weren ’t fulﬁ  lling his religious expectations.\nWarren thought back to McGavran, the author. McGavran ’s phi-\nlosophy said that if you teach people to live with Christian habits, they’ll act as Christians without requiring constant guidance and monitoring. Warren couldn ’t lead every single small group in per-son; he couldn ’t be there to make sure every conversation focused on Christ instead of the latest TV shows. But if he gave people new habits, he ﬁ  gured, he wouldn ’t need to. When people gathered, their \ninstincts would be to discuss the Bible, to pray together, to embody their faith.\nSo Warren created a series of curriculums, used in church classes \nand small group discussions, which were explicitly designed to teach parishioners new habits.\n“If you want to have Christ-like character, then you just develop \nthe habits that Christ had,” one of Saddleback’s course manuals reads. “ All of us are simply a bundle of habits. . . . Our goal is to help you replace some bad habits with some good habits that will help you grow in Christ’s likeness.” Every Saddleback member is asked to sign a “maturity covenant card” promising to adhere to three hab-its: daily quiet time for reﬂ  ection and prayer, tithing 10 percent of \ntheir income, and membership in a small group. Giving everyone new habits has become a focus of the church.\n“Once we do that, the responsibility for spiritual growth is no \nlonger with me, it’s with you. We’ve given you a recipe,” Warren told \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   238 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   238 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nSaddleback Church and the Montgomery Bus Boycott ● 239\nme. “We don ’t have to guide you, because you’re guiding yourself. \nThese habits become a new  self- identity, and, at that point, we just need to support you and get out of your way.”\nWarren ’s insight was that he could expand his church the same \nway Martin Luther King grew the boycott: by relying on the combi-nation of strong and weak ties. Transforming his church into a movement,  however— scaling it across twenty thousand parishion-ers and thousands of other  pastors— required something more, something that made it  self- perpetuating. Warren needed to teach people habits that caused them to live faithfully not because of their ties, but because it’s who they are.\nThis is the third aspect of how social habits drive movements: \nFor an idea to grow beyond a community, it must become  self- propelling. And the surest way to achieve that is to give people new habits that help them ﬁ  gure out where to go on their own.\n● ● ●\nAs the bus boycott expanded from a few days into a week, and then \na month, and then two months, the commitment of Montgomery’s black community began to wane.\nThe police commissioner, citing an ordinance that required taxi-\ncabs to charge a minimum fare, threatened to arrest cabbies who drove blacks to work at a discount. The boycott’s leaders responded by signing up two hundred volunteers to participate in a carpool. Police started issuing tickets and harassing people at carpool meet-ing spots. Drivers began dropping out. “It became more and more difﬁ cult to catch a ride,” King later wrote. “Complaints began to rise. \nFrom early morning to late at night my telephone rang and my door-bell was seldom silent. I began to have doubts about the ability of the Negro community to continue the struggle.”\nOne night, while King was preaching at his church, an usher ran \nup with an urgent message. A bomb had exploded at King’s house \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   239 Duhi_978",

The police chief, who months earlier had publicly declared his support for the racist White Citizens’ Council, pulled King aside and asked him to do  something— anything— to stop a riot from breaking out.\nKing walked to his porch.“Don ’t do anything panicky,” he shouted to the crowd. “Don ’t get \nyour weapons. He who lives by the sword shall perish by the sword.”\nThe crowd grew still.“We must love our white brothers, no matter what they do to us,” \nKing said. “We must make them know that we love them. Jesus still cries out in words that echo across the centuries: ‘Love your ene-mies; bless them that curse you; pray for them that despitefully use you.’”\nIt was the message of nonviolence that King had been increas-\ningly preaching for weeks. Its theme, which drew on the writings of Gandhi and Jesus’s sermons, was in many ways an argument listen-ers hadn ’t heard in this context before, a plea for nonviolent activ-ism, overwhelming love and forgiveness of their attackers, and a promise that it would bring victory. For years, the civil rights move-ment had been kept alive by couching itself in the language of bat-tles and struggles. There were contests and setbacks, triumphs and defeats that required everyone to recommit to the ﬁ  ght.\nKing gave people a new lens. This wasn ’t a war, he said. It was an \nembrace.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   240 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   240 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nSaddleback Church and the Montgomery Bus Boycott ● 241\nEqually important, King cast the boycott in a new and different \nlight. This was not just about equality on buses, King said; it was part of God’s plan, the same destiny that had ended British colonial-ism in India and slavery in the United States, and that had caused Christ to die on the cross so that he could take away our sins. It was the newest stage in a movement that had started centuries earlier. And as such, it required new responses, different strategies and be-haviors. It needed participants to offer the other cheek. People could show their allegiance by adopting the new habits King was evange-lizing about.\n“We must meet hate with love,” King told the crowd the night of \nthe bombing. “If I am stopped, our work will not stop. For what we are doing is right. What we are doing is just. And God is with us.”\nWhen King was done speaking, the crowd quietly walked home.“If it hadn ’t been for that nigger preacher,” one white policeman \nlater said, “we’d all be dead.”\nThe next week, two dozen new drivers signed up for the car-\npool. The phone calls to King’s home slowed. People began  self- organizing, taking leadership of the boycott, propelling the movement. When more bombs exploded on the lawns of other boycott organiz-ers, the same pattern played out. Montgomery’s blacks showed up en masse, bore witness without violence or confrontation, and then went home.\nIt wasn ’t just in response to violence that this  self- directed unity \nbecame visible. The churches started holding mass meetings every  week— sometimes every night. “They were kind of like Dr. King’s speech after the  bombing— they took Christian teachings and made them political,” Taylor Branch told me. “ A movement is a saga. For it to work, everyone’s identity has to change. People in Montgomery had to learn a new way to act.”\nMuch like Alcoholics  Anonymous",
