As Voltaire once\nwrote, “The best is the enemy of the good.”\nI refer to this as the diﬀerence between being in motion\nand taking action. The two ideas sound similar , but they’re\nnot the same. When you’re in motion, you’re planning and\nstrategizing and learning. Those are all good things, but\nthey don’t produce a result.\nAction, on the other hand, is the type of behavior that\nwill deliver an outcome. If I outline twenty ideas for articles\nI want to write, that’s motion. If I actually sit down and\nwrite an article, that’s action. If I search for a better diet\nplan and read a few books on the topic, that’s motion. If I\nactually eat a healthy meal, that’s action.\nSometimes motion is useful, but it will never produce an\noutcome by itself . It doesn’t matter how many times you go\ntalk to the personal trainer , that motion will never get you\nin shape. Only the action of working out will get the result\nyou’re looking to achieve.\nIf motion doesn’t lead to results, why do we do it?\nSometimes we do it because we actually need to plan or\nlearn more. But more often than not, we do it because\nmotion allows us to feel like we’re making progress without\nrunning the risk of failure. Most of us are experts at\navoiding criticism. It doesn’t feel good to fail or to be\njudged publicly , so we tend to avoid situations where that\nmight happen. And that’s the biggest reason why you slip\ninto motion rather than taking action: you want to delay\nfailure.\nIt’s easy to be in motion and convince yourself that\nyou’re still making progress. Y ou think, “I’ve got\nconversations going with four potential clients right now .\nThis is good. W e’re moving in the right direction.” Or, “I\nbrainstormed some ideas for that book I want to write. This\nis coming together .”\nMotion makes you feel like you’re getting things done.\nBut really , you’re just preparing to get something done.\nWhen preparation becomes a form of procrastination, you\nneed to change something. Y ou don’t want to merely be\nplanning. Y ou want to be practicing.\nIf you want to master a habit, the key is to start with\nrepetition, not perfection. Y ou don’t need to map out every\nfeature of a new habit. Y ou just need to practice it.

With each\nrepetition, cell-to-cell signaling improves and the neural\nconnections tighten. First described by neuropsychologist\nDonald Hebb in 1949, this phenomenon is commonly known\nas Hebb’s Law: “ Neurons that ﬁre together wire together .”\nRepeating a habit leads to clear physical changes in the\nbrain. In musicians, the cerebellum—critical for physical\nmovements like plucking a guitar string or pulling a violin\nbow—is larger than it is in nonmusicians. Mathematicians,\nmeanwhile, have increased gray matter in the inferior\nparietal lobule, which plays a key role in computation and\ncalculation. Its size is directly correlated with the amount\nof time spent in the ﬁeld; the older and more experienced\nthe mathematician, the greater the increase in gray matter .\nWhen scientists analyzed the brains of taxi drivers in\nLondon, they found that the hippocampus—a region of the\nbrain involved in spatial memory—was signiﬁcantly larger\nin their subjects than in non–taxi drivers. Even more\nfascinating, the hippocampus decreased in size when a\ndriver retired. Like the muscles of the body responding to\nregular weight training, particular regions of the brain\nadapt as they are used and atrophy as they are abandoned.\nOf course, the importance of repetition in establishing\nhabits was recognized long before neuroscientists began\npoking around. In 1860, the English philosopher George H.\nLewes noted, “In learning to speak a new language, to play\non a musical instrument, or to perform unaccustomed\nmovements, great diﬀiculty is felt, because the channels\nthrough which each sensation has to pass have not become\nestablished; but no sooner has frequent repetition cut a\npathway , than this diﬀiculty vanishes; the actions become\nso automatic that they can be performed while the mind is\notherwise engaged.” Both common sense and scientiﬁc\nevidence agree: repetition is a form of change.\nEach time you repeat an action, you are activating a\nparticular neural circuit associated with that habit. This\nmeans that simply putting in your reps is one of the most\ncritical steps you can take to encoding a new habit. It is\nwhy the students who took tons of photos improved their\nskills while those who merely theorized about perfect\nphotos did not. One group engaged in active practice, the\nother in passive learning. One in action, the other in\nmotion.\nAll habits follow a similar trajectory from eﬀortful\npractice to automatic behavior , a process known as\nautomaticity . Automaticity is the ability to perform a\nbehavior without thinking about each step, which occurs\nwhen the nonconscious mind takes over .\nIt looks something like this:\nTHE HABIT LINE\nFIGURE 11:  In the beginning (point A), a habit r equir es a good\ndeal of eﬀort and concentration to perfor m. After a few\nrepetitions (point B), it gets easier, but still r equir es some\nconscious attention. W ith enough practice (point C), the habit\nbecomes mor e automatic than conscious. Beyond this thr eshold\n—the habit line —the behavior can be done mor e or less without\nthinking. A new habit has been for med.\nOn the following page, you’ll see what it looks like when\nresearchers track the level of automaticity for an actual\nhabit like walking for ten minutes each day . The shape of\nthese charts, which scientists call  learning curves , reveals\nan important truth about behavior change: habits form\nbased on frequency , not time.\nWALKING 10 MINUTES PER DA Y\nFIGURE 12:  This graph shows someone who built the habit of\nwalking for ten minutes af ter br eakfast each day . Notice that as\nthe repetitions incr ease, so does automaticity, until the behavior\nis as easy and automatic as it can be.\nOne of the most common questions I hear is, “How long\ndoes it take to build a new habit?” But what people really\nshould be asking is, “How many  does it take to form a new\nhabit?” That is, how many repetitions are required to make\na habit automatic?\nThere is nothing magical about time passing with regard\nto habit formation. It doesn’t matter if it’s been twenty-one\ndays or thirty days or three hundred days. What matters is\nthe rate at which you perform the behavior . You could do\nsomething twice in thirty days,",

You could do\nsomething twice in thirty days, or two hundred times. It’s\nthe frequency that makes the diﬀerence. Y our current\nhabits have been internalized over the course of hundreds,\nif not thousands, of repetitions. New habits require the\nsame level of frequency . You need to string together\nenough successful attempts until the behavior is ﬁrmly\nembedded in your mind and you cross the Habit Line.\nIn practice, it doesn’t really matter how long it takes for\na habit to become automatic. What matters is that you take\nthe actions you need to take to make progress. Whether an\naction is fully automatic is of less importance.\nTo build a habit, you need to practice it. And the most\neﬀective way to make practice happen is to adhere to the\n3rd Law of Behavior Change: make it easy . The chapters\nthat follow will show you how to do exactly that.\nChapter Summary\nThe 3rd Law of Behavior Change is make it easy .\nThe most",
