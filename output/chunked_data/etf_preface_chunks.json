In fact, I hope thatthis book changes your life forever.\nThere is never enough time to do everything you have to do. You are\nliterally swamped with work and personal responsibilities, projects,stacks of magazines to read and piles of books you intend to get toone of these days as soon as you get caught up.\nBut the fact is that you are never going to get caught up. You will\nnever get on top of your tasks. You will never get far enough ahead\nto be able to get to all those books, magazines and leisure time\nactivities that you dream of doing.\nAnd forget about solving your time management problems by\nbecoming more productive. No matter how many personal\nproductivity techniques you master, there will always be more to do\nthan you can ever accomplish in the time you have available to you,\nno matter how much it is.\nYou can only get control of your time and your life by changing the\nway you think, work and deal with the never ending river of\nresponsibilities that flows over you each day. You can only get\ncontrol of your tasks and activities to the degree that you stop doing\nsome things and start spending more time on the few things that can\nreally make a difference in your life.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 4I have studied time management for more than thirty years. I have\nimmersed myself in the works of Peter Drucker, Alex Mackenzie,\nAlan Lakein, Stephen Covey and many, many others. I have read\nhundreds of books and thousands of articles on personal efficiencyand effectiveness. This book is the result.\nEach time I came across a good idea, I tried it out in my own work\nand personal life. If it worked, I incorporated it into my talks andseminars and taught it to others.\nGalileo once wrote, “You cannot teach a person something he does\nnot already know; you can only bring what he does know to hisawareness.”\nDepending upon your level of knowledge and experience, these ideas\nwill sound familiar. This book will bring them to a higher level ofawareness. When you learn and apply these methods and techniques\nover and over until they become habits, you will alter the course of\nyour life in a very positive way.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 5MY OWN STORY\nLet me tell you something about myself and the origins of this little\nbook. I started off in life with few advantages, aside from a curiousmind. I did poorly in school and left without graduating. I worked atlaboring jobs for several years. My future did not appear promising.\nAs a young man, I got a job on a tramp freighter and went off to see\nthe world. For eight years, I traveled and worked, and then traveledsome more, eventually visiting more than eighty countries on five\ncontinents.\nWhen I could no longer find a laboring job, I got into sales, knocking\non doors, working on straight commission. I struggled from sale to\nsale until I began looking around me and asking, “Why is it that\nother people are doing better than I am?”\nThen I did something that changed my life. I began to ask successful\npeople what they were doing that enable them to be more productive\nand earn more money than me. And they told me. And I did what\nthey advised me to do, and my sales went up. Eventually, I became\nso successful that they made me a sales manager. As a sales manager,\nI used the same strategy. I asked successful managers what they did\nto achieve such great results, and when they told me, I went out and\ndid the same things. In no time at all, I began to get the same results\nthey did.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 6This process of learning and applying what I had learned changed\nmy life. I am still amazed at how simple and obvious it is. Just find\nout what other successful people do and do the same things until you\nget the same results. Learn from the experts. Wow! What an idea.\nSuccess Is Predictable\nSimply put, some people are doing better than others because they do\nthings differently and they do the right things right. Especially,successful, happy, prosperous people use their time far, far better\nthan the average person.\nComing from an unsuccessful background, I had developed deep\nfeelings of inferiority and inadequacy. I had fallen into the mental\ntrap of assuming that people who were doing  better than me were\nactually better than me. What I learned was that this was not\nnecessarily true. They were just doing things differently, and what\nthey had learned to do, within reason, I could learn as",

They were just doing things differently, and what\nthey had learned to do, within reason, I could learn as well.\nThis was a revelation to me. I was both amazed and excited with this\ndiscovery. I still am.  I realized that I could change my life and\nachieve almost any goal I could set if I just found out what others\nwere doing in that area and then did it myself until I got the same\nresults they were getting.\nWithin one year of starting in sales, I was a top salesman. A year later\nI was made a manager. Within three years, I became a vice-president\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 7in charge of a 95 person sales force in six countries. I was twenty-five\nyears old.\nOver the years, I have worked in twenty-two different jobs, started\nand built several companies, earned a business degree from a majoruniversity, learned to speak French, German and Spanish and been a\nspeaker, trainer or consultant for more than 1000 companies. I\ncurrently give talks and seminars to more than 250,000 people eachyear, with audiences as large as 20,000 people.\nA Simple Truth\nThroughout my career, I have discovered and rediscovered a simple\ntruth. It is this: the ability to concentrate single-mindedly on your\nmost important task, to do it well and to finish it completely, is the\nkey to great success, achievement, respect, status and happiness inlife. This key insight is the heart and soul of this book.\nThis book is written to show you how to get ahead more rapidly in\nyour career and to simultaneously enrich your personal life. These\npages contain the twenty-one most powerful principles on personal\neffectiveness I have ever discovered.\nThese methods, techniques and strategies are practical, proven and\nfast acting. In the interests of time, I do not dwell on the various\npsychological or emotional explanations for procrastination or poor\ntime management. There are no lengthy departures into theory or\nresearch. What you will learn are specific actions you can take\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 8immediately to get better, faster results in your work, and to increase\nyour happiness with your family and other people.\nEvery idea in this book is focused on increasing your overall levels of\nproductivity, performance and output, and on making you morevaluable in whatever you do. You can apply many of these ideas to\nyour personal life as well.\nEach of these twenty-one methods and techniques is complete in\nitself. All are necessary. One strategy might be effective in one\nsituation and another might apply to another task. All together, these\ntwenty-one ideas represent a smorgasbord of personal effectivenesstechniques that you can use at any time, in any order or sequence that\nmakes sense to you at the moment.\nThe key to success is action. These principles work to bring about\nfast, predictable improvements in performance and results. The faster\nyou learn and apply them, the faster you will move ahead in your\ncareer, guaranteed!\nThere will be no limit to what you can accomplish when you learn\nhow to “Eat That Frog!”\nBrian Tracy",
