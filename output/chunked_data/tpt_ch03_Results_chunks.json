The Pomodoro has to represent an effective atomic measure of work. In other words, the \nPomodoro has to measure equal units of continuous effort; as such these units are \ncomparable with others. The pr oblem is that, as everyone knows, all time is not equal in \nterms of the output of effort. All months aren’t equal: December is shorter in terms of \nnumber of productive days and so is August in Mediterranean countries. Likewise, all the \nweeks in a month aren’t equal: we don’t give  the same effort every single week. All the \ndays in a week aren’t equal: some days you can work 8 hours, others only 5 if you need to \ntravel or go to the dentist; in still other days you may work 10 or 12 hours (less often, \nhopefully). Even all the hours in a day aren’t equal: not ev ery hour produces the same \namount of effort, mostly because of interruptio ns. As a unit of measure, much smaller time \nintervals such as 10 minutes might not be interrupted, but they don’t allow us to achieve \nappreciable results, and tracking becomes much too intrusive. So as far as this first force, \nhalf an hour seems to be ideal. \n! The Pomodoro has to encourage consciousness, concentration, and clear-minded thinking. \nIt’s been proven that 20- to 45-minute time intervals can maximize our attention and mental \nactivity, if followed by a short break (15).  \nIn light of these two forces, we’ve come to consider the ideal Pomodoro as 20 – 35 \nminutes long, 40 minutes at the most. Experience shows that the Pomodoro Technique works \nbest with 30-minute time periods. \n  \nNote   In various work groups which experimented with the Pomodoro Technique in mentoring \nactivities, each team was allowed to choose the length of their own Pomodoro on the condition \nthat this choice had to be based on observations regarding effectiveness. Generally, the teams \nstarted off with hour-long Pomodoros (25 minutes seemed too short at first), then moved to 2 \nhours, then down to 45 minutes, then 10, till they finally settled on 30 minutes. \n \n3.3 Varying the Length of Breaks \nThe length of breaks depends on the how tired you feel. Breaks at the end of a set should last \nfrom 15 to 30 minutes. For example, if you’ve kept up an intense rhythm throughout the whole \nday, at the end of the next to last set of Po modoros your break will natu rally last 25 minutes. If \nThe Pomodoro Technique 25 \n \n \n© Francesco Cirillo 19/10/2006 you have to solve a very complicated problem, you’ll need a 25-minute break between every \nset. If you’re especially tired, it’s possible and even beneficial to lengthen breaks between sets \nevery so often. But breaks that consistently exceed 30 minutes risk interrupting  the rhythm \nbetween sets of Pomodoros. More importantly, this sets off an alarm signaling the need for rest \nand free time!  \n I t  w o u l d  b e  a  s e r i o u s  m i s t a k e  t o  t a k e  s h o r t e r  b r e a k s  b e t w e e n  s e t s  b e c a u s e  y o u ’ r e  u n d e r  \npressure.

Taking a shorter break because you’re in a rush \ncould lead to a mental block in finding solutions. \n \nNote   For beginners, once the last Pomodoro in the set of four is up, it’s a good idea to set the \ntimer for 25 minutes and start the break. The aim he re isn’t to rigidly impose 25 minutes, but to \nensure you don’t go over 30 minutes of break time. This should be done only at the beginning. \nIn time, you’ll realize how tired you are and understand when you’re refreshed and ready to \nstart again. \n \nThe same can be said for breaks between Pomodoros, which should be no less than 3-5 \nminutes. When you’re especially tired, you can stop working for up to 10 minutes. Remember, \nthough, that downtime between Pomodoros that consistently lasts more than 5-10 minutes risks \nbreaking the rhythm between Pomodoros. It would be better to finish the current set and take a \n15-30 minute break. The best way to manage your resources is to work strategically, first \nincreasing the breaks between sets, and then ex tending the breaks between Pomodoros, if need \nbe.  \nThe most fitting metaphor for managing breaks is long-distance runners. At the start of \nthe marathon, they know they have the energy to run faster, but they also know their limits and \nthe difficulty of the challenge ahead. They manage  their resources to achieve the best result at \nthe finish line. \n3.4 A Different Perception of Time \nThe first benefit that comes from applying the Pomodoro Technique, which is already apparent \nin the first few days, is sharpe r focus and concentration that comes from a different perception \nof time. This new perception of time that passes seems to elicit the following sensations: \n1. The first 25-minute Pomodoros seem to pass more slowly.  \n2. After a few days of constant application of the Pomodoro, users say they can actually feel \nthe mid-way point of the 25 minutes. \n3. By the end of the first week of constant ap plication of the Pomodoro, users say they can \nactually feel when 5 minutes are left on the Pomodoro. In fact, many people report having \nsome sense of fatigue during these final minutes. \nWe can stimulate this ability to feel time in a different way by means of a series of \nexercises which serve to enhance consciousness of passing time among Pomodoro users. This \ndifferent awareness of the passage of time seems to lead Pomodoro users to a higher level of \nconcentration in performing the activity at hand. \n3.5 Sounds of the Pomodoro \nThe Pomodoro emits two sounds: it ticks and it rings (after 25 minutes). As regards these \nsounds, there are several things to consider fro m two different perspectives: Pomodoros users, \nand people sharing the same work space with Pomodoro users. \n3.5.1   People W ho Use the Pomodoro  \nLet’s first consider Pomodoro users. When th ey start applying the Pomodoro Technique, the \nticking and ringing can be annoying. There are various ways to make these sounds softer, but \nexperience shows that in time (even with just a few days of constant application) two things \nhappen:  \n! The ticking becomes a calming sound. “It’s ticking and I’m working and everything’s fine.” \nThe Pomodoro Technique 26 \n \n \n© Francesco Cirillo 19/10/2006 ! After a while, users don’t even hear the ring beca use their level of concentration is so high. \nIn fact, not hearing the Pomodoro ring actually becomes a real problem in some cases. \nClearly the different sensations that are elicit ed by the same sounds are signs of a profound \nchange in the perception of time that passes. \n3.5.2   People Who are Subject to the Pomodoro  \nNow consider people who have to “put up with” the Pomodoro. This situation would arise when \nthe Technique is used in a shared space, for exam ple study halls at a university or an open space \nwork environment. To respect the people who don’t use the Pomodoro, a number of solutions \nhave been tested. In order of effectiveness, th ere are: watches that count down 25 minutes and \nthen flash or beep softly; cell phones with softwa re applications that vibrate or make the display \nflash (for example the PomodoroMobile by XPLabs); kitchen timers with muted rings; \nPomodoro computer software, aka soft-Pomodoro (first among these is the JTom",

The ticking and ringing of several Pomodoros in an environment where a team is \nusing the Pomodoro Technique isn’t considered bothersome.  \n3.6 Shapes of the Pomodoro \nObviously, the kitchen timer you use doesn’t have to be shaped like a tomato. Apples, pears, \noranges, toasters, cooks, spheres, and UFOs: the market for timers is a varied as it is upbeat. \nChoosing your own Pomodoro (or we should say timer) makes the Technique more enjoyable \nand more accessible. \n3.7 Ring Anxiety \nWith the first few Pomodoros when learning the Technique, there may be some anxiety from \nthe feeling of being controlled by the Pomodoro. Experience shows that this feeling mainly \nemerges in two cases: \n! among people who are not used to self-discipline \n! among people who are very oriented toward achieving results \nIn both cases, it will prove difficult to concentrate on the primary objective of the \nTechnique: empowering each person to improve his or her work or study process through self-\nobservation.  \nFor people who aren’t used to self-discipline, ring anxiety generally comes from the \nfear that the Pomodoro Technique might be used to externally monitor their progress. It’s \nimportant to stress that the aim of the Technique is not to carry out any sort of external analysis \nor control. With the Pomodoro Technique, ther e is no inspector who monitors workers’ hours \nand methods in a Tayloristic fashion. The Po modoro Technique mustn’t be misconstrued as a \nform of this kind of external control. Instead, the Pomodoro Technique was created to satisfy \nthe personal need to improve, and it has to be applied spontaneously. \nCases of results-oriented people are more common. If every tick seems like an \ninvitation to work quickly, if every tock repeats the question, “Am I going fast enough?” these \nare signs of full immersion in what we might call the Becoming  Syndrome . And today this is \nquite common. The underlying fear people have here is usually the inability to demonstrate their \neffectiveness as fully as they’d like to others and to themselves. The Pomodoro is a method for \ncomparison, if not with others then at the leas t with themselves, and every tick and tock seems \nto reveal their lack of ability. Under pressure fro m time that passes, they look for shortcuts, but \nthis isn’t the way to go faster; shortcuts lead to defects and interruptions which feed into their \nfear of time in a vicious circle. How can they co me to hear the ticking as a calming sound? The \nidea, the solution might be just around the corner with the next tick, but they’ll miss it if they \nkeep thinking how fast time is passing.  \nThe first thing to learn with the Pomodoro Technique is that seeming fast isn’t \nimportant, reaching the point of actually being fast is. You do this by learning to measure \nyourself, observe how you work, and develop the value of continuity. This is why the first \nobjective to achieve with the Pomodoro Technique is simply to mark down the Pomodoros \nyou’ve done. \nThe Pomodoro Technique 27 \n \n \n© Francesco Cirillo 19/10/2006 If it takes four Pomodoros to draft a simple two-page review, it’s not important that you \nexpected to finish in two Pomodoros, or that you want to show everyone that you can finish in \ntwo Pomodoros. What’s important is to find out how to go from four to two. \nThe initial challenge is knowing how to an alyze how you work on the basis of test \nmeasurements collected every 30 minutes and not having expectations as to the result. Simply \nwork, track, observe, and change in order to improve, if need be. Once this point is understood, \nthe ticking starts to have a different sound.

Every tick of the Pomodoro, if you hear \nit, is an invitation to stay focused, alert, and to continue.  \n \nNote  At first, even getting through a single Pomodoro a day without interruptions is an excellent \nresult, because it allows you to observe your process. The next day your effort will be focused \non completing at least one Pomodoro with no interruptions, possibly two or more. With the \nPomodoro Technique, the number of Pomodoros you finish doesn’t matter so much as the \npathway to consistently achieving more Pomodoros. This same incremental approach should be \nused when you take up the Pomodoro Technique again after you haven’t used it for some time \n(for example, when you get back from a vacation). In this case, it takes patience and a bit of \ntraining to consistently reach 10-12 Pomodoros a day. \n \n3.8 Constant Internal Interruptions \nWhen you perceive internal interruptions as things that can’t be postponed, it becomes difficult \nto complete even a single Pomodoro in a whole day. In these cases, we suggest you set the \nPomodoro for 25 minutes and force yourself, Pomodoro after Pomodoro, to increase (and more \nimportantly never reduce) the time you work non-stop. The final objective is to get to the 25-\nminute mark having worked continuously, with no interruptions. “In this Pomodoro I’ve \nmanaged to work for 10 minutes without interruptions, in the next one I’m going to work no \nless than 10 minutes, maybe even just one minute more.” Results come Pomodoro after \nPomodoro.  \n \n3.9 The Next Pomodoro Will Go Better \nThe feeling of having the time to do things and not using it well is often incapacitating. Your \nmind starts wandering from the past to the future: “If I had done that research on Internet \nyesterday, and last week I’d sent that email...How  will I deliver the report by next week?” This \nprovokes feelings of guilt and creates anxiety-filled situations. \nThe Pomodoro Technique allows you to keep your focus on the current Pomodoro, or \nonce that’s done, on the next Pomodoro. Your attention is trained on the here and now, \nemphasizing the search for a concrete way to s timulate the value of continuity and carry out \nactivities in the most reasonable order. \nWhen you feel lost, a Pomodoro can be dedicated to explorationin order to set your \npriorities straight and lay out a new plan. If your ideas are clear but something’s missing – \nmaybe determination, maybe a bit of courage - wind up the Pomodoro and start working on it, \nwithout waiting for time. \nPeople who have the habit of procrastinating say that they benefit from the fact that the \nPomodoro enables them to concentrate and achieve little things (activities that take 5-7 \nPomodoros worth of effort, at the most), without having to worry about every thing. One \nPomodoro at a time, one activity at a time, one objective at a time. For personality types with a \nstrong tendency to procrastinate, it’s important to realize that the initial objective is to finish one \nPomodoro: 25 minutes of work on a given activity, without interruptions. \nThe Pomodoro Technique 28 \n \n \n© Francesco Cirillo 19/10/2006 3.10 A Mechanical Pomodoro or Pomodoro Software \nWhat kind of Pomodoro is most effective: a mechanical timer or a Soft-Pomodoro for the \ncomputer?  Speaking from experience, the most effective Pomodoro is always the kitchen timer. \nIn any case, to guarantee the highest possible effectiveness, the Pomodoro has to meet a number \nof requirements: \n! You have to be able to actually wind it up. The act of winding up the Pomodoro is a \ndeclaration of your determination to start working on the activity at hand. \n! It has to clearly show how much time is left, and it should make a ticking sound as time \npasses. This is a way we can practice feeling time and staying focused. \n! It should make an audible, easily id entified sound to signal that time’s up. \nWhat’s more, to mark the end of a Pomodoro or to eliminate a finished activity from the To Do \nToday Sheet, Pomodoro practitioners should use expl icit gestures. For this reason it’s better if \nthese aren’t automated. \n3.11 Improving Estimates  \nOne of the more tangible results that can be attained with the Pomodoro Technique involves \nimproving the ability to",

In fact, \nthe aim of breaking down activities should never be simply to divide them up as far as possible. \nInstead, the point is to identify incremental paths which have the lowest possible complexity. \n3.12 Motivation and the Pomodoro \nWith the Pomodoro Technique, three factors contribute to boosting personal motivation: \n! Completing several activities a day that aren’t too simple or too complex (Rule: If it Takes \nMore than 5-7 Pomodoros, Break It Down.), which serve to reach your objective (13). \n! Directly influencing personal improvement on a day to day basis. \n!

For this reason it’s better if \nthese aren’t automated. \n3.11 Improving Estimates  \nOne of the more tangible results that can be attained with the Pomodoro Technique involves \nimproving the ability to estimate. This develops along two pathways: \n! Improvement of quantitative estimates by reducing the error between estimated Pomodoros \nand actual Pomodoros. In other words, while planning the day’s tasks, the effort needed to \ncomplete a given activity can be accurately predicted. Self-observation and 30-minute \nmeasurements are the basis for more exact estim ates. Experience shows that a positive sign \nof improvement in estimation is when the num ber of cases of underestimation is equal to \nthe number of cases of overestimation. A strategy oriented toward systematic \noverestimation or underestimation does not lead to quantitative improvement. Learning to \nestimate is essential in order to be effective. \n! Improvement of qualitative estimates by reducing the number of activities that weren’t \nincluded in the planning phase. In other words, while planning the day’s tasks, the number \nand type of activity that actually has to be done can be pinpointed (weak version), or better \nstill the specific set of activities that",

Overall underestimation happens when we \ndon’t correctly identify the activities that have to be done, or we don’t realize that the \nactivities we have identified aren’t the most effective. With the Pomodoro Technique, \nunplanned activities are tracked when they emerge. Observing and understanding the nature \nof these activities allows Pomodoro users to hone their forecasting and organizing skills. \nWhy does the Pomodoro Technique improve both aspects of estimation? One of the \ncommon causes of quantitative and qualitative impr ovement is that the activities we measure \nare continually divided up according to the rule: If It Takes More Than 5-7 Pomodoros, Break It \nDown.
