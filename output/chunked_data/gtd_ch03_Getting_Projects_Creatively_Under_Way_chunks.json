Although th e \nprocess may seem somewhat random, a quite com- \nplex series of steps in fact has to occur before yo ur \nbrain can make anything happen physically. Your \nmind goes through five steps to accomplish virtuall y \nany task: \n56 1 | Defining purpose and principles \n2 | Outcome visioning \n3 | Brainstorming \n4 | Organizing \n5 | Identifying next actions \nA Simple Example: Planning Dinner Out \nThe last time you went out to dinner, what initiall y caused you to \nthink about doing it? It could have been any number  of things—\nthe desire to satisfy hunger, socialize with friend s, celebrate a spe- \ncial occasion, sign a business deal, or develop a r omance. As soon \nas any of these turned into a real inclination that  you wanted to \nmove on, you started planning. Your intention was y our purpose, \nand it automatically triggered your internal planni ng process. \nYour principles created the boundaries of your plan. You probably \ndidn't consciously think about your principles regarding going out \nto dinner, but you thought within them: standards of food and \nservice, affordability, convenience, and comfort al l may have The most \nexperienced planner \nin the world is your \nbrain. \nCHAPTER 3  I  GETTING PROJECTS CREATIVELY UNDER WAY: THE FIVE PHASES OF PLANNING \nplayed a part. In any case, your purpose and princi ples were the \ndefining impetus and boundaries of your planning. \nOnce you decided to fulfill your purpose, what were  your \nfirst substantive thoughts? Probably not \"point II. A.3.b. in plan.\" \nYour first ideas were more likely things like \"Ital ian food at Gio- \nvanni's,\" or \"Sitting at a sidewalk table at the Bi stro Cafe.\" You \nprobably also imagined some positive picture of wha t you might \nexperience or how the evening would turn out—maybe the peo- \nple involved, the atmosphere, and/or the outcome.

It's how you create \nthings—dinner, a relaxing evening, a new product, o r a new com- \npany. You have an urge to make something happen; yo u image the \noutcome; you generate ideas that might be relevant;  you sort those \ninto a structure; and you define a physical activit y that would \nbegin to make it a reality. And you do all of that naturally, without \ngiving it much thought. \nNatural Planning Is Not Necessarily Normal \nBut is the process described above the way your com mittee is \nplanning the church retreat? Is it how your IT team  is approach- \ning the new system installation? Is it how you're o rganizing the \nwedding or thinking through the potential merger? \nHave you clarified the primary purpose of the proje ct and com- \nmunicated it to everyone who ought to know it? And have you \nagreed on the standards and behaviors you'll need t o \nadhere to to make it successful? \nHave you envisioned success and considered \nall the innovative things that might result if you \nachieved it? \n58 Have you \nenvisioned wild \nsuccess lately? \nCHAPTER 3  |  GETTING PROJECTS CREATIVELY UNDER WAY: THE FIVE PHASES OF PLANNING \nHave you gotten all possible ideas out on the table —\neverything you need to take into consideration that  might affect \nthe outcome? \nHave you identified the mission-critical components , key \nmilestones, and deliverables? \nHave you defined all the aspects of the project tha t could be \nmoved on right now, what the next action is for eac h part, and \nwho's responsible for what? \nIf you're like most people I interact with in a coa ching or \nconsulting capacity, the collective answer to these  questions is, \nprobably not. There are likely to be at least some components of \nthe natural planning model that you haven't impleme nted. \nIn some of my seminars I get participants to actual ly plan a \ncurrent strategic project that uses this model. In only a few minutes \nthey walk themselves through all five phases, and u sually end up \nbeing amazed at how much progress they've made comp ared with \nwhat they have tried to do in the past. One gentlem an came up \nafterward and told me, \"I don't know whether I shou ld thank you or \nbe angry. I just finished a business plan I've been  telling myself \nwould take months, and now I have no excuses for no t doing it!\" \nYou can try it for yourself right now if you like. Choose one \nproject that is new or stuck or that could simply u se some \nimprovement. Think of your purpose. Think of what a  successful \noutcome would look like: where would you be physica lly, finan- \ncially, in terms of reputation, or whatever? Brains torm potential \nsteps. Organize your ideas. Decide on the next acti ons. Are you \nany clearer about where you want to go and how to g et there? \nThe Unnatural Planning Model \nTo emphasize the importance of utilizing the natura l planning \nmodel for the more complex things we're involved wi th, let's con- \ntrast it with the more \"normal\" model used in most \nenvironments—\nwhat I call unnatural planning. \n59 \nTHE ART OF GETTING THINGS DONE  |  PART ONE \nWhen the \"Good Idea\" Is a Bad Idea \nHave you ever heard a well-intentioned manager star t a meeting \nwith the question, \"OK, so who's got a good idea ab out this?\" \nWhat is the assumption here? Before any evaluation of \nwhat's a \"good idea\" can be trusted, the purpose mu st \nbe clear, the vision must be well defined, and all the \nrelevant data must have been collected (brain- \nstormed) and analyzed (organized). \"What's a good \nidea?\" is a good question, but only when you're abo ut \n80 percent of the way through your thinking! Start- \ning there would probably blow anyone's creative \nmental fuses.",

To know and to be clear about the purpose of\nany activity are prime directives for clarity, crea tive \ndevelopment,  and cooperation.  But it's common \nsense that's not commonly practiced, simply because  it's so easy \nfor us to create things, get caught up in the form of what we've \ncreated, and let our connection with our real and p rimary inten- \ntions slip. \nI know, based upon thousands of hours spent in many  offices \nwith many sophisticated people, that the \"why?\" que stion cannot \nbe ignored. When people complain to me about having  too many \nmeetings, I have to ask, \"What is the purpose of th e meetings?\" \nWhen they ask, \"Who should I invite to the planning  session?\" I \nhave to ask, \"What's the purpose of the planning se ssion?\" Until \nwe have the answer to my questions, there's no possible way to \ncome up with an appropriate response to theirs. \nThe Value of Thinking About \"Why\" \nHere are just some of the benefits of asking \"why?\" : \n• It defines success. \n• It creates decision-making criteria. \n• It aligns resources. \n• It motivates. \n• It clarifies focus. \n• It expands options. \nLet's take a closer look at each of these in turn.

And if you want to sleep well, you'd b etter have a \ngood answer when your board asks why you fired your  V.P. of \nmarketing or hired that hotshot M.B.A. as your new finance \ndirector.

Your daughter is clear about your guidelines \nand support for her first semester in college. \nThe Power of Focus \nSince the 1960s thousands of books have expounded o n the value \nof appropriate positive imagery and focus. Forward- looking focus \nhas even been a key element in Olympic-level sports  training, \nwith athletes imagining the physical effort, the po sitive energy, \nand the successful result to ensure the highest lev el of unconscious \nsupport for their performance. \nWe know that the focus we hold in our minds \naffects what we perceive and how we perform. This i s \nas true on the golf course as it is in a staff meet ing or \nduring a serious conversation with a spouse. My \ninterest lies in providing a model for focus that i s \ndynamic in a practical way, especially in project \nthinking. \nWhen you focus on something—the vacation you're goi ng \nto \ntake, the meeting you're about to go into, the prod uct you want to \nlaunch—that focus instantly creates ideas and thoug ht patterns \nyou wouldn't have had otherwise. Even your physiolo gy will \nrespond to an image in your head as if it were real ity. \n67 Imagination is \nmore important \nthan knowledge. \n—Albert Einstein \nTHE ART OF GETTING THINGS DONE  I  PART ONE \nThe Reticular Activating System The May 1957 issue of Scientific \nAmerican contained an article describing the discovery of th e \nreticular formation at the base of the brain. The r eticular forma- \ntion is basically the gateway to your conscious awa reness; it's the \nswitch that turns on your perception of ideas and d ata, the thing \nthat keeps you asleep even when music's playing but  wakes you if \na special little baby cries in another room. \nJust like a computer, your brain has a search \nfunction—but it's even more phenomenal than a \ncomputer's. It seems to be programmed by what we \nfocus on and, more primarily, what we identify with . \nIt's the seat of what many people have referred to as \nthe paradigms we maintain. We notice only what \nmatches our internal belief systems and identified \ncontexts. If you're an optometrist, for example, yo u'll \ntend to notice people wearing eyeglasses across a \ncrowded room; if you're a building contractor, you \nmay notice the room's physical details. If you focu s \non the color red right now and then just glance \naround your environment, if there is any red at all , \nyou'll see even the tiniest bits of it. \nThe",
