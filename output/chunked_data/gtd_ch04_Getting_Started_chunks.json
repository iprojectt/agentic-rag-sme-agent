The suggestions that follow \nabout getting time, space, and tools in place are a ll trusted meth- \nods for making things happen at a terrific new leve l. \nIf you're sincere about making a major leap forward  in your \npersonal management systems, I recommend that you p ay close \nattention to the details and follow through on the suggestions \nprovided below in their entirety.

If your space is properly set up  and streamlined, \nit can reduce your unconscious resistance to dealin g with your \nstuff and even make it attractive for you to sit down and crank \nthrough your input and your work. An ideal time fra me for most \npeople is two whole days, back to back. (Don't be p ut off by that if \nyou don't have that long to spend, though: doing an y of the activi- \nties I suggest will be useful, no matter how much o r how little \ntime you devote to them.

If you already have a desk and office space s et up where you \nwork, that's probably the best place to start. If y ou work from a \nhome office, obviously that will be your prime location. If you \nalready have both, you'll want to establish identic al, even inter- \nchangeable systems in both places. \nThe basics for a work space are just a writing surf ace and \nroom for an in-basket. Some people, such as a forem an in a \nmachine shop, an intake nurse on a hospital floor, or your chil- \ndren's nanny, won't need much more than that. The w riting sur- \nface will of course expand for most professionals, to include a \nphone, a computer, stacking trays, working file dra wers, reference \nshelves. Some may feel the need for a fax, a printe r, a VCR, and/ \nor multimedia conferencing equipment. The seriously  self- \ncontained will also want gear for exercise, leisure , and hobbies. \nA functional work space is critical. If you don't a lready have a \ndedicated work space and in-basket, get them now. T hat goes for \nstudents, homemakers, and retirees, too. Everyone m ust have a \nphysical locus of control from which to deal with e verything else. \nIf I had to set up an emergency workstation in just  a few \nminutes, I would buy a door, put it on top of two t wo-drawer fil- \ning cabinets (one at each end), place three stack-b askets on it, and \nadd a legal pad and pen. That would be my home base  (if I had \ntime to sit down, I'd also buy a stool!). Believe i t or not, I've been \nin several executive offices that wouldn't be as fu nctional. \nIf You Go to an Office, You'll Still Need a Space a t Home \nDon't skimp on work space at home. As you'll discov er through \nthis process, it's critical that you have at least a satellite home \n89 \nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  |  PART TWO \nsystem identical to the one in your office. Many pe o- \nple I've worked with have been somewhat embar- \nrassed by the degree of chaos that reigns in their \nhomes, in contrast to their offices at work; they'v e \ngotten tremendous value from giving themselves \npermission to establish the same setup in both plac es. \nIf you're like many of them, you'll find that a wee k- \nend spent setting up a home workstation can make a revolution- \nary change in your ability to organize your life. \nAn Office Space in Transit \nIf you move around much, as a business traveler or jus t as a person \nwith a mobile life-style, you'll also want to set u p an efficiently \norganized micro-office-in-transit. More than likely  this will con- \nsist of a briefcase, pack, or satchel with appropri ate folders and \nportable workstation supplies. \nMany people lose opportunities to be productive bec ause \nthey're not equipped to take advantage of the odd m oments and \nwindows of time that open up as they move from one place to \nanother, or when they're in off-site environments. The combina- \ntion of a good processing style, the right tools, a nd good intercon- \nnected systems at home and at work can make traveli ng a highly \nleveraged way to get certain kinds of work done. \nDon't Share Space! \nIt is imperative that you have your own work space—or at least your \nown in-basket and a physical place in which to proc ess paper. Too \nmany married couples I've worked with have tried to  work out of a \nsingle desk at home, and it always makes light-year s of difference \nwhen they expand to two workstations. Far from bein g the \"separa- \ntion\" they expect, the move in fact relieves them o f a subtle stress in \ntheir relationship about managing the stuff of thei r shared lives. \nOne couple even decided",

In addit ion to a desktop \nwork space, you'll need: \n• Paper-holding trays (at least three) \n• A stack of plain letter-size paper \n• A pen/pencil \n•Post-its (3X3s) \n• Paper clips \n• Binder clips \n• A stapler and staples \n• Scotch tape \n• Rubber bands \n• An automatic labeler \n• File folders \n• A calendar \n• Wastebasket/recycling bins \nPaper-Holding Trays \nThese will serve as your in-basket and out-basket, with one or \ntwo others for work-in-progress support papers and/ or your \"read \nand review\" stack. The most functional trays are th e side-facing \nletter or legal stackable kinds, which have no \"lip \" on them to \nkeep you from sliding out a single piece of paper. \nPlain Paper \nYou'll use plain paper for the initial collection p rocess. Believe it \nor not, putting one thought on one full-size sheet of paper can \nhave enormous value. Although most people will wind  up pro- \ncessing their notes into some sort of list organize r, a few will actu- \nally stick with the simple piece-of-paper-per-thoug ht system. In \nany case, it's important to have plenty of letter-s ize writing paper \nor tablets around to make capturing ad hoc input ea sy. \nCHAPTER 4  |  GETTING STARTED: SETTING UP THE TIME, SPACE, AND  TOOLS \nPost-its, Clips, Stapler, Etc. \nPost-its, clips, stapler, tape, and rubber bands wi ll \ncome in handy for routing and storing paper-based \nmaterials.

For \nnow, just keep using the one you've got. After you develop a feel \nfor the whole systematic approach, you'll have a be tter reference \npoint for deciding about graduating to a different tool. \nWastebasket/Recycling Bins \nIf you're like most people, you're going to toss a lot more stuff \nthan you expect, so get ready to create a good bit of trash.

Do you need reminder s of things \nlike calls you have to make when it's not easy to c arry file folders? \nAnd so on. There are also the aesthetic and enjoyme nt factors. \nI've done some of my best planning and updating for  myself when \nI simply wanted some excuse to use (i.e., play with ) my Palm \norganizer while waiting for dinner in a restaurant!\nWhen considering whether to get and use an organize r, and \nif so, which one, keep in mind that all you really need to do is \nmanage lists. You've got to be able to create a lis t on the run and \nreview it easily and as regularly as you need to.

Take  heart: I've seen \npeople go from resisting to actually enjoying sorting through their \nstacks once their personal filing system is set up and humming. \nYou must feel equally comfortable about filing a si ngle piece \nof paper on a new topic—even a scribbled note—in it s own file \nas \nyou would about filing a more formal, larger docume nt. Because it \nrequires so much work to make and organize files, p eople either \ndon't keep them or have junked-up cabinets and draw ers full of all \nsorts of one-of-a-kind items, like a menu for the l ocal take-out \ncafe or the current train schedule. \nWhatever you need to do to get your reference syste m to that \nquick and easy standard for everything it has to ho ld, do it. My \nsystem works wonderfully for me and for many others  who try it, \nand I highly recommend that you consider incorporat ing all of \nthe following guidelines to really make reference f iling automatic. \nKeep Your General-Reference Files at Hand's Reach Filing has to \nbe instantaneous and easy. If you have to get up ev ery time you \nhave some ad hoc piece of paper you want to file, y ou'll tend to \nstack it instead of filing it, and you're also like ly to just resist the \nwhole in-basket process (because you subconsciously  know there's \nstuff in there that might need filing!). Many people I have \ncoached have redesigned their office space so they have four \ngeneral-reference file drawers literally in \"swivel  distance,\" instead \nof across their room. \nOne Alpha System I have one A—Z alphabetical filing system, not \nmultiple systems.
