This technique is so simple and effective\nthat it can, all by itself, make you one of the most efficient and\neffective people in your field.\nThink on Paper\nThe power of this technique lies in its simplicity . Here’s how it works:\nYou start with a list of everything you have to do for the coming day.\nThink on paper.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 46You then place an A, B, C, D or E before each item on your list before\nyou begin the first task.\nAn \"A\" item is defined as something that is very important. This is\nsomething that you must do. This is a task for which there can beserious consequences if you do it or fail to do it, like visiting a key\ncustomer or finishing a report for your boss that she needs for an\nupcoming board meeting. These are the frogs of your life.\nIf you have more than one \"A\" task, you prioritize these tasks by\nwriting A-1, A-2, A-3, and so on in front of each item. Your A-1\ntask is your biggest, ugliest frog of all.\n“Shoulds” versus “Musts”\nA \"B\" item is defined as a task that you should do. But it only has mild\nconsequences. These are the tadpoles of your work life. This means\nthat someone may be unhappy or inconvenienced if you don't do it,\nbut it is nowhere as important as an \"A\" task. Returning an\nunimportant telephone message or reviewing your email would be a\n\"B\" task.\nThe rule is that you should never do a \"B\" task when there is an \"A\"\ntask left undone. You should never be distracted by a tadpole when\nthere is a big frog sitting there waiting to be eaten.\nA \"C\" task is defined as something that would be nice to do, but for\nwhich there are no consequences at all, whether you do it or not. \"C\"\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 47tasks include phoning a friend, having coffee or lunch with a\ncoworker or completing some personal business during work hours.\nThis sort of activity has no affect at all on your work life.\nA \"D\" task is defined as something you can delegate to someone else.\nThe rule is that you should delegate everything that anyone else can\ndo so that you can free up more time for the \"A\" tasks that only you\ncan do.\nAn \"E\" task is defined as something that you can eliminate altogether\nand it won't make any real difference.\nThis may be a task that was important at one time but which is no\nlonger relevant to yourself or anyone else. Often it is something you\ncontinue to do out of habit or because you enjoy it. But every minute\nthat you spend on an “E” task is time taken away from a task oractivity that can make a real difference in your life.\nAfter you have applied the ABCDE Method to your list, you will now\nbe completely organized and ready to get more important things\ndone faster.\nTake Action Immediately\nThe key to making this ABCDE Method work is for you to now\ndiscipline yourself to start immediately on your \"A-1\" task and then\nstay at it until it is complete. Use your willpower to get going and\nstay going on this one job, the most important single task you could\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 48possibly be doing. Eat the whole frog and don’t stop until it’s\nfinished completely.\nYour ability to think through, analyze your work list and determine\nyour \"A-1\" task is the springboard to higher levels ofaccomplishment, and greater self-esteem, self-respect and personal\npride.\nWhen you develop the habit of concentrating on your \"A-1,\" most\nimportant activity, on eating your frog, you will start getting more\ndone than any two or three people around you.\nEat That Frog!\n1.
