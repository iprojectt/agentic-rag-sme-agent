The subjects were divided into three groups.\nThe ﬁrst group was the control group. They were simply\nasked to track how often they exercised.\nThe second group was the “motivation” group. They\nwere asked not only to track their workouts but also to\nread some material on the beneﬁts of exercise. The\nresearchers also explained to the group how exercise could\nreduce the risk of coronary heart disease and improve\nheart health.\nFinally , there was the third group. These subjects\nreceived the same presentation as the second group, which\nensured that they had equal levels of motivation. However ,\nthey were also asked to formulate a plan for when and\nwhere they would exercise over the following week.\nSpeciﬁcally , each member of the third group completed the\nfollowing sentence: “During the next week, I will partake in\nat least 20 minutes of vigorous exercise on [DA Y] at [TIME]\nin [PLACE].”\nIn the ﬁrst and second groups, 35 to 38 percent of\npeople exercised at least once per week. (Interestingly , the\nmotivational presentation given to the second group\nseemed to have no meaningful impact on behavior .) But 91\npercent of the third group exercised at least once per week\n—more than double the normal rate.\nThe sentence they ﬁlled out is what researchers refer to\nas an implementation intention , which is a plan you make\nbeforehand about when and where to act. That is, how you\nintend  to implement  a particular habit.\nThe cues that can trigger a habit come in a wide range of\nforms—the feel of your phone buzzing in your pocket, the\nsmell of chocolate chip cookies, the sound of ambulance\nsirens—but the two most common cues are time and\nlocation. Implementation intentions leverage both of these\ncues.\nBroadly speaking, the format for creating an\nimplementation intention is:\n“When situation X arises, I will perform response\nY.”\nHundreds of studies have shown that implementation\nintentions are eﬀective for sticking to our goals, whether\nit’s writing down the exact time and date of when you will\nget a ﬂu shot or recording the time of your colonoscopy\nappointment. They increase the odds that people will stick\nwith habits like recycling, studying, going to sleep early ,\nand stopping smoking.\nResearchers have even found that voter turnout\nincreases when people are forced to create implementation\nintentions by answering questions like: “ What route are\nyou taking to the polling station? A t what time are you\nplanning to go? What bus will get you there?” Other\nsuccessful government programs have prompted citizens to\nmake a clear plan to send taxes in on time or provided\ndirections on when and where to pay late traﬀic bills.\nThe punch line is clear: people who make a speciﬁc plan\nfor when and where they will perform a new habit are more\nlikely to follow through. T oo many people try to change\ntheir habits without these basic details ﬁgured out. W e tell\nourselves, “I’m going to eat healthier” or “I’m going to\nwrite more,” but we never say when and where these\nhabits are going to happen. W e leave it up to chance and\nhope that we will “just remember to do it” or feel motivated\nat the right time. An implementation intention sweeps away\nfoggy notions like “I want to work out more” or “I want to\nbe more productive” or “I should vote” and transforms\nthem into a concrete plan of action.\nMany people think they lack motivation when what they\nreally lack is clarity . It is not always obvious when and\nwhere to take action. Some people spend their entire lives\nwaiting for the time to be right to make an improvement.\nOnce an implementation intention has been set, you\ndon’t have to wait for inspiration to strike. Do I write a\nchapter today or not? Do I meditate this morning or at\nlunch?  When the moment of action occurs, there is no need\nto make a decision. Simply follow your predetermined plan.\nThe simple way to apply this strategy to your habits\nis to ﬁll out this sentence:\nI will [BEHA VIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCA TION].\nMeditation.

People are more likely to\ntake action at those times because hope is usually higher . If\nwe have hope, we have a reason to take action. A fresh\nstart feels motivating.\nThere is another beneﬁt to implementation intentions.\nBeing speciﬁc about what you want and how you will\nachieve it helps you say no to things that derail progress,\ndistract your attention, and pull you oﬀ course. W e often\nsay yes to little requests because we are not clear enough\nabout what we need to be doing instead. When your\ndreams are vague, it’s easy to rationalize little exceptions\nall day long and never get around to the speciﬁc things you\nneed to do to succeed.\nGive your habits a time and a space to live in the world.\nThe goal is to make the time and location so obvious that,\nwith enough repetition, you get an urge to do the right\nthing at the right time, even if you can’t say why . As the\nwriter Jason Zweig noted, “Obviously you’re never going to\njust work out without conscious thought. But like a dog\nsalivating at a bell, maybe you start to get antsy around the\ntime of day you normally work out.”\nThere are many ways to use implementation intentions in\nyour life and work.

Despite his lack of\nwealth, Diderot was well known for his role as the co-\nfounder and writer of Encyclopédie , one of the most\ncomprehensive encyclopedias of the time. When Catherine\nthe Great, the Empress of Russia, heard of Diderot’s\nﬁnancial troubles, her heart went out to him. She was a\nbook lover and greatly enjoyed his encyclopedia. She\noﬀered to buy Diderot’s personal library for £1,000—more\nthan $150,000 today .* Suddenly , Diderot had money to\nspare. W ith his new wealth, he not only paid for the\nwedding but also acquired a scarlet robe for himself .\nDiderot’s scarlet robe was beautiful. So beautiful, in fact,\nthat he immediately noticed how out of place it seemed\nwhen surrounded by his more common possessions. He\nwrote that there was “ no more coordination, no more unity ,\nno more beauty” between his elegant robe and the rest of\nhis stuﬀ .\nDiderot soon felt the urge to upgrade his possessions. He\nreplaced his rug with one from Damascus. He decorated his\nhome with expensive sculptures. He bought a mirror to\nplace above the mantel, and a better kitchen table. He\ntossed aside his old straw chair for a leather one. Like\nfalling dominoes, one purchase led to the next.\nDiderot’s behavior is not uncommon. In fact, the\ntendency for one purchase to lead to another one has a\nname: the Diderot Eﬀect. The Diderot Eﬀect states that\nobtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of\nconsumption that leads to additional purchases.\nYou can spot this pattern everywhere. Y ou buy a dress\nand have to get new shoes and earrings to match. Y ou buy\na couch and suddenly question the layout of your entire\nliving room. Y ou buy a toy for your child and soon ﬁnd\nyourself purchasing all of the accessories that go with it.\nIt’s a chain reaction of purchases.\nMany human behaviors follow this cycle. Y ou often\ndecide what to do next based on what you have just\nﬁnished doing. Going to the bathroom leads to washing and\ndrying your hands, which reminds you that you need to put\nthe dirty towels in the laundry , so you add laundry\ndetergent to the shopping list, and so on. No behavior\nhappens in isolation. Each",

No behavior\nhappens in isolation. Each action becomes a cue that\ntriggers the next behavior .\nWhy is this important?\nWhen it comes to building new habits, you can use the\nconnectedness of behavior to your advantage. One of the\nbest ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit\nyou already do each day and then stack your new behavior\non top. This is called habit stacking .\nHabit stacking is a special form of an implementation\nintention. R ather than pairing your new habit with a\nparticular time and location, you pair it with a current\nhabit. This method, which was created by BJ F ogg as part\nof his Tiny Habits program, can be used to design an\nobvious cue for nearly any habit. *\nThe habit stacking formula is:\n“After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”\nFor example:\nMeditation. A fter I pour my cup of coﬀee each\nmorning, I will meditate for one minute.\nExercise. A fter I take oﬀ my work shoes, I will\nimmediately change into my workout clothes.\nGratitude. A fter I sit down to dinner , I will say one\nthing I’m grateful for that happened today .\nMarriage. A fter I get into bed at night, I will give my\npartner a kiss.\nSafety . After I put on my running shoes, I will text a\nfriend or family member where I am running and how\nlong it will take.\nThe key is to tie your desired behavior into something\nyou already do each day . Once you have mastered this basic\nstructure, you can begin to create larger stacks by chaining\nsmall habits together . This allows you to take advantage of\nthe natural momentum that comes from one behavior\nleading into the next—a positive version of the Diderot\nEﬀect.\nHABIT ST ACKING\nFIGURE 7:  Habit stacking incr eases the lik elihood that you’ll stick\nwith a habit by stacking your new behavior on top of an old one.\nThis pr ocess can be r epeated to chain numer ous habits\ntogether, each one acting as the cue for the ne xt.\nYour morning routine habit stack might look like this:\n1. After I pour my morning cup of coﬀee, I will meditate\nfor sixty seconds.\n2. After I meditate for sixty seconds, I will write my to-do\nlist for the day .\n3. After I write my to-do list for the day , I will\nimmediately begin my ﬁrst task.\nOr, consider this habit stack in the evening:\n1. After I ﬁnish eating dinner , I will put my plate directly\ninto the dishwasher .\n2. After I put my dishes away , I will immediately wipe\ndown the counter .\n3. After I wipe down the counter , I will set out my coﬀee\nmug for tomorrow morning.\nYou can also insert new behaviors into the middle of your\ncurrent routines. F or example, you may already have a\nmorning routine that looks like this: W ake up > Make my\nbed > T ake a shower . Let’s say you want to develop the\nhabit of reading more each night. Y ou can expand your\nhabit stack and try something like: W ake up > Make my\nbed > Place a book on my pillow  > Take a shower . Now ,\nwhen you climb into bed each night, a book will be sitting\nthere waiting for you to enjoy .\nOverall, habit stacking allows you to create a set of\nsimple rules that guide your future behavior . It’s like you\nalways have a game plan for which action should come\nnext. Once you get comfortable with this approach, you can\ndevelop general habit stacks to guide you whenever the\nsituation is appropriate:\nExercise. When I see a set of stairs, I will take them\ninstead of using the elevator .\nSocial skills. When I walk into a party , I will introduce\nmyself to someone I don’t know yet.\nFinances. When I want to buy something over $100, I\nwill wait twenty-four hours before purchasing.\nHealthy eating. When I serve myself a meal, I will\nalways put veggies on my plate ﬁrst.\nMinimalism. When I buy a new item, I will give\nsomething away . (“One in, one out.”)\nMood. When the phone rings, I will take one deep\nbreath and smile before answering.\nForgetfulness.

When I leave a public place, I will check\nthe table and chairs to make sure I don’t leave\nanything behind.\nNo matter how you use this strategy , the secret to\ncreating a successful habit stack is selecting the right cue\nto kick things oﬀ . Unlike an implementation intention,\nwhich speciﬁcally states the time and location for a given\nbehavior , habit stacking implicitly has the time and location\nbuilt into it. When and where you choose to insert a habit\ninto your daily routine can make a big diﬀerence. If you’re\ntrying to add meditation into your morning routine but\nmornings are chaotic and your kids keep running into the\nroom, then that may be the wrong place and time. Consider\nwhen you are most likely to be successful. Don’t ask\nyourself to do a habit when you’re likely to be occupied\nwith something else.\nYour cue should also have the same frequency as your\ndesired habit. If you want to do a habit every day , but you\nstack it on top of a habit that only happens on Mondays,\nthat’s not a good choice.\nOne way to ﬁnd the right trigger for your habit stack is\nby brainstorming a list of your current habits. Y ou can use\nyour Habits Scorecard from the last chapter as a starting\npoint. Alternatively , you can create a list with two columns.\nIn the ﬁrst column, write down the habits you do each day\nwithout fail. *\nFor example:\nGet out of bed.\nTake a shower .\nBrush your teeth.\nGet dressed.\nBrew a cup of coﬀee.\nEat breakfast.\nTake the kids to school.\nStart the work day .\nEat lunch.\nEnd the work day .\nChange out of work clothes.\nSit down for dinner .\nTurn oﬀ the lights.\nGet into bed.\nYour list can be much longer , but you get the idea. In the\nsecond column, write down all of the things that happen to\nyou each day without fail. F or example:\nThe sun rises.\nYou get a text message.\nThe song you are listening to ends.\nThe sun sets.\nArmed with these two lists, you can begin searching for\nthe best place to layer your new habit into your lifestyle.\nHabit stacking works best when the cue is highly speciﬁc\nand immediately actionable. Many people select cues that\nare too vague. I made this mistake myself . When I wanted\nto start a push-up habit, my habit stack was “ When I take a\nbreak for lunch, I will do ten push-ups.” A t ﬁrst glance, this\nsounded reasonable. But soon, I realized the trigger was\nunclear . Would I do my push-ups before I ate lunch? A fter I\nate lunch? Where would I do them? A fter a few inconsistent\ndays, I changed my habit stack to: “ When I close my laptop\nfor lunch, I will do ten push-ups next to my desk.”\nAmbiguity gone.\nHabits like “read more” or “eat better” are worthy\ncauses, but these goals do not provide instruction on how\nand when to act. Be speciﬁc and clear: A fter I close the\ndoor. After I brush my teeth. A fter I sit down at the table.\nThe speciﬁcity is important. The more tightly bound your\nnew habit is to a speciﬁc cue, the better the odds are that\nyou will notice when the time comes to act.\nThe 1st Law of Behavior Change is to make it obvious.\nStrategies like implementation intentions and habit\nstacking are among the most practical ways to create\nobvious cues for your habits and design a clear plan for\nwhen and where to take action.\nChapter Summary\nThe 1st Law of Behavior Change is make it obvious .\nThe two most common cues are time and location.\nCreating an implementation intention is a strategy you\ncan use to pair a new habit with a speciﬁc time and\nlocation.\nThe implementation intention formula is: I will\n[BEHA VIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCA TION].\nHabit stacking is a strategy you can use to pair a new\nhabit with a current habit.\nThe habit stacking formula is: A fter [CURRENT\nHABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].",

Alternatively , you can create a list with two columns.\nIn the ﬁrst column, write down the habits you do each day\nwithout fail. *\nFor example:\nGet out of bed.\nTake a shower .\nBrush your teeth.\nGet dressed.\nBrew a cup of coﬀee.\nEat breakfast.\nTake the kids to school.\nStart the work day .\nEat lunch.\nEnd the work day .\nChange out of work clothes.\nSit down for dinner .\nTurn oﬀ the lights.\nGet into bed.\nYour list can be much longer , but you get the idea. In the\nsecond column, write down all of the things that happen to\nyou each day without fail. F or example:\nThe sun rises.\nYou get a text message.\nThe song you are listening to ends.\nThe sun sets.\nArmed with these two lists, you can begin searching for\nthe best place to layer your new habit into your lifestyle.\nHabit stacking works best when the cue is highly speciﬁc\n",

When I leave a public place, I will check\nthe table and chairs to make sure I don’t leave\nanything behind.\nNo matter how you use this strategy , the secret to\ncreating a successful habit stack is selecting the right cue\nto kick things oﬀ . Unlike an implementation intention,\nwhich speciﬁcally states the time and location for a given\nbehavior , habit stacking implicitly has the time and location\nbuilt into it. When and where you choose to insert a habit\ninto your daily routine can make a big diﬀerence. If you’re\ntrying to add meditation into your morning routine but\nmornings are chaotic and your kids keep running into the\nroom, then that may be the wrong place and time. Consider\nwhen you are most likely to be successful. Don’t ask\nyourself to do a habit when you’re likely to be occupied\nwith something else.\nYour cue should also have the same frequency as your\ndesired habit.
