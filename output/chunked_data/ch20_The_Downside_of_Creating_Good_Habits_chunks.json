    "text": " the\nhistory of basketball,” head coach P at Riley said after the\nseason. Surprisingly , the Lakers stumbled in the 1986\nplayoﬀs and suﬀered a season-ending defeat in the W estern\nConference Finals. The “best team in the history of\nbasketball” didn’t even play for the NBA championship.\nAfter that blow , Riley was tired of hearing about how\nmuch talent his players had and about how much promise\nhis team held. He didn’t want to see ﬂashes of brilliance\nfollowed by a gradual fade in performance. He wanted the\nLakers to play up to their potential, night after night. In the\nsummer of 1986, he created a plan to do exactly that, a\nsystem that he called the Career Best Eﬀort program or\nCBE.\n“When players ﬁrst join the Lakers,” Riley explained, “we\ntrack their basketball statistics all the way back to high\nschool. I call this T aking Their Number . We look for an\naccurate gauge of what a player can do, then build him into\nour plan for the team, based on the notion that he will\nmaintain and then improve upon his averages.”\nAfter determining a player’s baseline level of\nperformance, Riley added a key step. He asked each player\nto “improve their output by at least 1 percent over the\ncourse of the season. If they succeeded, it would be a CBE,\nor Career Best Eﬀort.” Similar to the British Cycling team\nthat we discussed in Chapter 1, the Lakers sought peak\nperformance by getting slightly better each day .\nRiley was careful to point out that CBE was not merely\nabout points or statistics but about giving your “best eﬀort\nspiritually and mentally and physically .” Players got credit\nfor “allowing an opponent to run into you when you know\nthat a foul will be called against him, diving for loose balls,\ngoing after rebounds whether you are likely to get them or\nnot, helping a teammate when the player he’s guarding has\nsurged past him, and other ‘unsung hero’ deeds.”\nAs an example, let’s say that Magic Johnson—the Lakers\nstar player at the time—had 11 points, 8 rebounds, 12\nassists, 2 steals, and 5 turnovers in a game. Magic also got\ncredit for an “unsung hero” deed by diving after a loose\nball (+1). Finally , he played a total of 33 minutes in this\nimaginary game.\nThe positive numbers (11 + 8 + 12 + 2 + 1) add up to\n34. Then, we subtract the 5 turnovers (34–5) to get 29.\nFinally , we divide 29 by 33 minutes played.\n29/33 = 0.879\nMagic’s CBE number here would be 879. This number\nwas calculated for all of a player’s games, and it was the\naverage CBE that a player was asked to improve by 1\npercent over the season. Riley compared each player’s\ncurrent CBE to not only their past performances but also\nthose of other players in the league. As Riley put it, “ We\nrank team members alongside league opponents who play\nthe same position and have similar role deﬁnitions.”\nSportswriter Jackie MacMullan noted, “Riley trumpeted\nthe top performers in the league in bold lettering on the\nblackboard each week and measured them against the\ncorresponding players on his own roster . Solid, reliable\nplayers generally rated a score in the 600s, while elite\nplayers scored at least 800. Magic Johnson, who submitted\n138 triple-doubles in his career , often scored over 1,000.”\nThe Lakers also emphasized year-over-year progress by\nmaking historical comparisons of CBE data. Riley said, “ We\nstacked the month of November 1986, next to November\n1985, and showed the players whether they were doing\nbetter or worse than at the same point last season. Then we\nshowed them how their performance ﬁgures for December\n1986, stacked up against November’s.”\nThe Lakers rolled out CBE in October 1986. Eight\nmonths later , they were NBA champions. The following\nyear, Pat Riley led his team to another title as the Lakers\nbecame the ﬁrst team in twenty years to win back -to-back\nNBA championships. A fterward, he said, “ Sustaining an\neﬀort is the most important thing for any enterprise. The\nway to be successful is to learn how to do things right, then\ndo them the same way every time.”\nThe CBE program is a prime example of the power of\nreﬂection and review",

    "text": " thing for any enterprise. The\nway to be successful is to learn how to do things right, then\ndo them the same way every time.”\nThe CBE program is a prime example of the power of\nreﬂection and review . The Lakers were already talented.\nCBE helped them get the most out of what they had, and\nmade sure their habits improved rather than declined.\nReﬂection and review enables the long-term\nimprovement of all habits because it makes you aware of\nyour mistakes and helps you consider possible paths for\nimprovement. W ithout reﬂection, we can make excuses,\ncreate rationalizations, and lie to ourselves. W e have no\nprocess for determining whether we are performing better\nor worse compared to yesterday .\nTop performers in all ﬁelds engage in various types of\nreﬂection and review , and the process doesn’t have to be\ncomplex. K enyan runner Eliud Kipchoge is one of the\ngreatest marathoners of all time and an Olympic gold\nmedalist. He still takes notes after every practice in which\nhe reviews his training for the day and searches for areas\nthat can be improved. Similarly , gold medal swimmer Katie\nLedecky records her wellness on a scale of 1 to 10 and\nincludes notes on her nutrition and how well she slept. She\nalso records the times posted by other swimmers. A t the\nend of each week, her coach goes over her notes and adds\nhis thoughts.\nIt’s not just athletes, either . When comedian Chris Rock\nis preparing fresh material, he will ﬁrst appear at small\nnightclubs dozens of times and test hundreds of jokes. He\nbrings a notepad on stage and records which bits go over\nwell and where he needs to make adjustments. The few\nkiller lines that survive will form the backbone of his new\nshow .\nI know of executives and investors who keep a “decision\njournal” in which they record the major decisions they\nmake each week, why they made them, and what they\nexpect the outcome to be. They review their choices at the\nend of each month or year to see where they were correct\nand where they went wrong. *\nImprovement is not just about learning habits, it’s also\nabout ﬁne-tuning them. Reﬂection and review ensures that\nyou spend your time on the right things and make course\ncorrections whenever necessary—like P at Riley adjusting\nthe eﬀort of his players on a nightly basis. Y ou don’t want\nto keep practicing a habit if it becomes ineﬀective.\nPersonally , I employ two primary modes of reﬂection and\nreview . Each December , I perform an Annual Review , in\nwhich I reﬂect on the previous year . I tally my habits for the\nyear by counting up how many articles I published, how\nmany workouts I put in, how many new places I visited, and\nmore. * Then, I reﬂect on my progress (or lack thereof) by\nanswering three questions:\n1. What went well this year?\n2. What didn’t go so well this year?\n3. What did I learn?\nSix months later , when summer rolls around, I conduct\nan Integrity Report . Like everyone, I make a lot of\nmistakes. My Integrity Report helps me realize where I\nwent wrong and motivates me to get back on course. I use\nit as a time to revisit my core values and consider whether I\nhave been living in accordance with them. This is when I\nreﬂect on my identity and how I can work toward being the\ntype of person I wish to become. *\nMy yearly Integrity Report answers three questions:\n1. What are the core values that drive my life and work?\n2. How am I living and working with integrity right now?\n3. How can I set a higher standard in the future?\nThese two reports don’t take very long—just a few hours\nper year—but they are crucial periods of reﬁnement. They\nprevent the gradual slide that happens when I don’t pay\nclose attention. They provide an annual reminder to revisit\nmy desired identity and consider how my habits are helping\nme become the type of person I wish to be. They indicate\nwhen I should upgrade my habits and take on new\nchallenges and when I should dial my eﬀorts back and\nfocus on the fundamentals.\nReﬂection can also bring a sense of perspective. Daily\nhabits are powerful because of how they compound, but\nworrying too much about every daily choice is like looking\nat yourself in the mirror from an inch away . You can see\nevery imperfection and lose sight of the bigger picture.\nThere is too much feedback. Conversely , never reviewing",

You aren’t\naware of easily ﬁxable ﬂaws—a spot on your shirt, a bit of\nfood in your teeth. There is too little feedback.

As you latch on to that\nnew identity , however , those same beliefs can hold you back\nfrom the next level of growth. When working against you,\nyour identity creates a kind of “pride” that encourages you\nto deny your weak spots and prevents you from truly\ngrowing. This is one of the greatest downsides of building\nhabits.\nThe more sacred an idea is to us—that is, the more\ndeeply it is tied to our identity—the more strongly we will\ndefend it against criticism. Y ou see this in every industry .\nThe schoolteacher who ignores innovative teaching\nmethods and sticks with her tried-and-true lesson plans.\nThe veteran manager who is committed to doing things “his\nway.” The surgeon who dismisses the ideas of her younger\ncolleagues. The band who produces a mind-blowing ﬁrst\nalbum and then gets stuck in a rut. The tighter we cling to\nan identity , the harder it becomes to grow beyond it.\nOne solution is to avoid making any single aspect of your\nidentity an overwhelming portion of who you are. In the\nwords of investor P aul Graham, “ keep your identity small.”\nThe more you let a single belief deﬁne you, the less capable\nyou are of adapting when life challenges you. If you tie\neverything up in being the point guard or the partner at the\nﬁrm or whatever else, then the loss of that facet of your life\nwill wreck you. If you’re a vegan and then develop a health\ncondition that forces you to change your diet, you’ll have an\nidentity crisis on your hands. When you cling too tightly to\none identity , you become brittle. Lose that one thing and\nyou lose yourself .\nFor most of my young life, being an athlete was a major\npart of my identity . After my baseball career ended, I\nstruggled to ﬁnd myself . When you spend your whole life\ndeﬁning yourself in one way and that disappears, who are\nyou now?\nMilitary veterans and former entrepreneurs report\nsimilar feelings. If your identity is wrapped up in a belief\nlike “I’m a great soldier ,” what happens when your period\nof service ends? F or many business owners, their identity is\nsomething along the lines of “I’m the CEO” or “I’m the\nfounder .” If you have spent every waking moment working\non your business, how will you feel after you sell the\ncompany?\nThe key to mitigating these losses of identity is to\nredeﬁne yourself such that you get to keep important\naspects of your identity even if your particular role\nchanges.\n“I’m an athlete” becomes “I’m the type of person who\nis mentally tough and loves a physical challenge.”\n“I’m a great soldier” transforms into “I’m the type of\nperson who is disciplined, reliable, and great on a\nteam.”\n“I’m the CEO” translates to “I’m the type of person\nwho builds and creates things.”\nWhen chosen eﬀectively , an identity can be ﬂexible\nrather than brittle. Like water ﬂowing around an obstacle,\nyour identity works with the changing circumstances rather\nthan against them.\nThe following quote from the Tao Te Ching  encapsulates\nthe ideas perfectly:\nMen are born soft and supple;\ndead, they are stiﬀ and hard.\nPlants are born tender and pliant;\ndead, they are brittle and dry .\nThus whoever is stiﬀ and inﬂexible\nis a disciple of death.\nWhoever is soft and yielding\nis a disciple of life.\nThe hard and stiﬀ will be broken.\nThe soft and supple will prevail.\n—LAO TZU\nHab",
