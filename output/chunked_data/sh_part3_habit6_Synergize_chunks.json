When properly understood, synergy is the highest activity in all life -- the true test and \nmanifestation of all the other habits put together.    The highest forms of synergy focus the four unique human endowments, the motive of win-win, \nand the skills of empathic communication on the toug hest challenges we face in life.

It is the essence of principle-centered \nparenting.  It catalyzes, unifies, and unleashes th e greatest powers within people.  All the habits we \nhave covered prepare us to create the miracle of synergy.    What is synergy? Simply defined, it means that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.  It \nmeans that the relationship which the parts have to each other is a part in and of itself.  It is not only a \npart, but the most catalytic, the most empowering,  the most unifying, and the most exciting part. \n   The creative process is also the most terrifying part because you don't know exactly what's going to \nhappen or where it is going to lead.  You don't know  what new dangers and challenges you'll find.  It \ntakes an enormous amount of internal security to be gin with the spirit of adventure, the spirit of \ndiscovery, the spirit of creativity.  Without doubt, you have to leave the comfort zone of base camp \nand confront an entirely new and unknown wilderne ss.  You become a trailblazer, a pathfinder.  You \nopen new possibilities, new territories, new continents, so that others can follow. \n   Synergy is everywhere in nature.  If you plan t two plants close together, the roots commingle and \nimprove the quality of the soil so that both plants will grow better than if they were separated.  If you \nput two pieces of wood together, they will hold mu ch more than the total of  the weight held by each \nseparately.  The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.  One plus one equals three or more. \n   The challenge is to apply the principles of crea tive cooperation, which we learn from nature, in our \nsocial interactions.  Family life provides many o pportunities to observe synergy and to practice it. \n   The very way that man and a woman bring a child  into the world is synergistic.  The essence of \nsynergy is to value differences -- to respect them, to  build on strengths, to compensate for weaknesses. \n   We obviously value the physical differences between men and women, husbands and wives.  But \nwhat about the social, mental, and emotional differences? Could these di fferences not also be sources of \ncreating new exciting forms of life -- creating an envi ronment that is truly fulf illing for each person, that \nnurtures the self-esteem and self-worth to each, th at creates opportunities for each to mature into \nindependence and then gradually into interdepende nce? Could synergy not create a new script for the \nnext generation -- one that is more geared to serv ice and contribution, and is less protective, less \nadversarial, less selfish; one that is more open, mo re giving, and is less defensive, protective, and \npolitical; one that is more loving, more c aring, and is less possessive and judgmental? \n Synergistic Communication     When you communicate synergistically, yo u are simply opening yo ur mind and heart and \nexpressions to new possibilities, new alternatives, new options.

And that is  the end that you have in mind. \n   You begin with the belief that parties involved will  gain more insight, and th at the excitement of that \nmutual learning and insigh t will create a momentum toward mo re and more insights, learning, and \ngrowth.    Many people have not really experienced even a moderate degree of synergy in  their family life or in \nother interactions.  They've been trained and scripte d into defensive and protective communications or \ninto believing that life or other peop le can't be trusted.  As a result, they are never really open to Habit \n6 and to these principles.

There are times when neither the teacher nor the student know for sure what's going to happen.  In \nthe beginning, there's a safe environment that enables pe ople to be really open and to learn and to listen \nto each other's ideas.  Then come s brainstorming where the spirit of evaluation is subordinated to the \nspirit of creativity, imagining, and intellectual ne tworking.  Then an absolu tely unusual phenomenon \nbegins to take place.  The entire class is transfor med with the excitement of a new thrust, a new idea, a \nnew direction that's hard to define, yet it's  almost palpable to the people involved. \n   Synergy is almost as if a group collectively agr ees to subordinate old scripts and to write a new one. \n   I'll never forget a university class I taught in le adership philosophy and style.  We were about three \nweeks into a semester when, in the middle of a presen tation, one person started  to relate some very \npowerful personal experiences which were both emot ional and insightful.  A spirit of humility and \nreverence fell upon the class -- reverence toward th is individual and appreciation for his courage. \n   This spirit became fertile soil for a synergistic an d creative endeavor.  Others began to pick up on it, \nsharing some of their experiences an d insights and even some of their self-doubts.  The spirit of trust \nand safety prompted many to become extremely open.  Rather than present what they prepared, they \nfed on each other's insights and ideas and started to  create a whole new scenari o as to what that class \ncould mean.  \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o",

In fact, I was almost mesmerized by it because it seemed so \nmagical and creative.  And I found myself gradually loosening up my commitment to the structure of \nthe class and sensing entirely new possibilities.  It wa sn't just a flight of fancy; there was a sense of \nmaturity and stability and substance which tran scended by far the old structure and plan. \n   We abandoned the old syllabus, the purchased te xtbooks, and all the presentation plans, and we set \nup new purposes and projects and assignments.  We became so excited ab out what was happening \nthat in about three more weeks, we all sensed an overwhelming desire to share what was happening \nwith others    We decided to write a book containing our le arnings and insights on the subject of our study -- \nprinciples of leadership.  Assignments were chan ged, new projects undertaken, new teams formed.  \nPeople worked much harder than they ever would ha ve in the original class structure, and for an \nentirely different set of reasons    Out of this experience emerged an extremely un ique, cohesive, and synergistic culture that did not \nend with the semester.  For years, alumni meetings  were held among members of that class.  Even \ntoday, many years later, when we see each other, we talk about it and often attempt to describe what \nhappened and why.    One of the interesting things to me was how little time had transp ired before there was sufficient \ntrust to create such synergy.  I think it was larg ely because the people were relatively mature.  They \nwere in the final semester of their senior year, and I think they wanted more than just another good \nclassroom experience.  They were hungry for some thing new and exciting, something that they could \ncreate that was truly meaningful.  It was \"an idea  whose time had come\" for them. In addition, the \nchemistry was right.  I felt that experiencing sy nergy was more powerful than  talking about it, that \nproducing something new was more meaning ful than simply reading something old. \n   I've also experienced, as I believe most people  have, times that were almost  synergistic, times that \nhung on the edge of chaos and for some reason desce nded into it.  Sadly, people who are burned by \nsuch experiences often begin their next new experi e n c e  w i t h  t h a t  f a i l u r e  i n  m i n d .   T h e y  d e f e n d  \nthemselves against it and cut themselves off from synergy.    It's like administrators who set up new rules an d regulations based on the abuses of a few people \ninside an organization, thus limiting the freedom and creative possibilities for many -- or business \npartners who imagine the worst scenarios possible and write them up in legal language, killing the \nwhole spirit of creativity, enterprise, and synergistic possibility.    As I think back on many consulting and ex ecutive education experiences, I can say that the \nhighlights were almost always synergistic.  Th ere was usually an early moment that required \nconsiderable courage, perhaps in becoming extremely authentic, in confronting some inside truth about \nthe individual or the organization or  the family which really needed to be said, but took a combination \nof considerable courage and genuine love to say it .  Then others became mo re authentic, open, and \nhonest, and the synergistic communication process bega n.  It usually became more and more creative, \nand ended up in insights and plans th at no one had anticipated initially. \n   As Carl Rogers taught, \"That which is most personal is most general.\"  The more authentic you \nbecome, the more genuine in your expression, part icularly regarding personal experiences and even \nself-doubts, the more people can relate to your expr ession and the safer it makes them feel to express \nthemselves.  That expression in turn feeds back on the other person's spir it, and genuine creative \nempathy takes place, producing new insights and le arnings and a sense of excitement and adventure \nthat keeps the process going.    People then begin to interact wi th each other almost in half sent ences, sometimes incoherently, but \nthey get each other's meanings ve ry rapidly.

Almost all members of the company went \nhigh up into the mountains where, surrounded by th e magnificence of nature, we began with a first \ndraft of what some of us considered to be an excellent mission statement. \n   At first the communication was respectful, carefu l and predictable.  But as  we began to talk about \nthe various alternatives, possibilities, and opportunit ies ahead, people became very open and authentic \nand simply started to think out lo ud.  The mission statement agenda  gave way to a collective free \nassociation, a spontaneous piggyb acking of ideas.  People were genuinely empathic as well as \ncourageous, and we moved from mutual respec t and understanding to creative synergistic \ncommunication.    Everyone could sense it.  It was exciting.  As it matured, we returned to the task of putting the \nevolved collective vision into words, each of wh ich contains specific an d committed-to meaning for \neach participant.    The resulting corporate mission statement reads:    Our Mission is to empower people and organizat ions to significantly increase their performance \ncapability in order to achieve worthwhile purposes through understanding and living \nPrinciple-Centered Leadership.    The synergistic process that led to the creation of our mission statement eng raved it in all the hearts \nand minds of everyone there, and it has served us wel l as a frame of reference of what we are about, as \nwell as what we are not about.    Another high-level synergy experience took plac e when I accepted an invi tation to serve as the \nresource and discussion catalyst at the annual planni ng meeting of a large insurance company.  Several \nmonths ahead, I met with the committee responsibl e to prepare for and stage the two-day meeting \nwhich was to involve all the top executives.  They informed me that the t raditional pattern was to \nidentify four or five major issues through questi onnaires and interviews, and to have alternative \nproposals presented by the executives.  Past meet ings had been generally respectful exchanges, \noccasionally deteriorating into defensive win-lo se ego battles.  They were usually predictable, \nuncreative, and boring.    As I talked with the committee members about the power of synergy, they could sense its potential.  \nWith considerable trepidation, they agreed to chan ge the pattern.  They requested various executives \nto prepare anonymous \"white papers\" on each of the high priority issues, and then asked all the \nexecutives to immerse themselves in these papers ah ead of time in order to understand the issues and \nthe differing points of view.  They were to come to the meeting prepared to listen rather than to \npresent, prepared to create and synergiz e rather than to defend and protect. \n   We spent the first half-day in the meeting teaching  the principles and practici ng the skills of Habits 4, \n5, and 6.  The rest of the time was spent in creative synergy.    The release of creative energy was incredible.  Excitement replaced boredom.  People became very \nopen to each other's influence and generated new insi ghts and options.  By the end of the meeting an \nentirely new understanding of the nature of the ce ntral company challenge ev olved.  The white paper \nproposals became obsolete.  Differences were valu ed and transcended.  A new common vision began \nto form.    Once people have experienced real synergy, th ey are never quite the same again.  They know the \npossibility of having other such mind-expanding adventures in the future.    Often attempts are made to recreate a particular synergistic experience, but this seldom can be done.  \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I",

Snergy and Communication     Synergy is exciting.  Creativity is exciting.  It's phenomenal what openness and communication \ncan produce.  The possibilities of truly significant gain , of significant improvemen t are so real that it's \nworth the risk such openness entails.    After World War II, the United States commiss ioned David Lilienthal to head the new Atomic \nEnergy Commission.  Lilienthal brought together a gr oup of people who were highly influential -- \ncelebrities in their own right -- disciples, as it were, of their own frames of reference. \n   This very diverse group of individuals had an extremely heavy agenda, and they were impatient to \nget at it.  In addition, the press was pushing them. \n   But Lilienthal took several weeks to create a hi gh Emotional Bank Account.  He had these people \nget to know each other -- their interests, their hopes,  their goals, their concerns, their backgrounds, their \nframes of reference, their paradigms.  He facilitated  the kind of human interaction that creates a great \nbonding between people, and he was heavily criticized for taking the time to do it because it wasn't \n\"efficient.\"    But the net result was that this  group became closely knit together, very open with each other, very \ncreative, and synergistic.  The respect among the me mbers of the commission was so high that if there \nwas disagreement, instead of opposition and defense,  there was a genuine effo rt to understand.  The \nattitude was \"If a person of your intelligence and competence and commitment disagrees with me, then \nthere must be something to your disagreement that I don't understand, and I need to understand it.  \nYou have a perspective, a frame of reference I need to look at.\" Nonprotectiv e interaction developed, \nand an unusual culture was born.    The following diagram illustrates how closely trus t is related to different levels of communication. \n   The lowest level of communication coming out of low-trust situations would be characterized by \ndefensiveness, protectiveness, and often legalistic la nguage, which covers all the bases and spells out \nqualifiers and the escape clauses in the event thin gs go sour.  Such communication produces only \nwin-lose or lose-lose.  It isn't effective -- there' s no P/PC Balance -- and it creates further reasons to \ndefend and protect.    The middle position is respectful communication.   This is the level where fairly mature people \ninteract.  They have respect for each other, but they want to avoid the possibilit y of ugly confrontations, \nso they communicate politely but not empathically.  They might understand each other intellectually, \nbut they really don't deeply look at the paradigms  and assumptions underlying  their own opinions and \nbecome open to new possibilities.    Respectful communication works in independent situations and even in in terdependent situations, \nbut the creative possibilities are not opened up.  In interdependent situations compromise is the \nposition usually taken.  Compromise means that 1 + 1 + 1 =  1/2.  Both give and take.  The communication isn't defensive or pr otective or angry or manipulative ; it is honest and genuine and \nrespectful.  But it isn't creative or synergis tic.  It produces a low form of win-win. \n   Synergy means that 1 + 1 may equal 8, 16, or even 1,600.  The synergistic position of high trust produces solutions better than any originally propos ed, and all parties know it.  Furthermore, they \ngenuinely enjoy the creative enterprise.  A miniculture is  formed to satisfy in and of itself.  Even if it \nis short-lived, the P/PC Balance is there.  \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t",

But \neven in these circumstances, the spirit of sincer e trying will usually result in a more effective \ncompromise.  Fishing for the A Third Alternative     To get a better idea of how our level of communication affects our interdependent effectiveness, \nenvision the following scenario.    It's vacation time, and a husband wants to take his family out to the lake country to enjoy camping \nand fishing.  This is important to him; he's been planning it all year.  He's made reservations at a \ncottage on the lake and arranged to rent a boat, and his sons are really excited about going. \n   His wife, however, wants to use the vacation time  to visit her ailing mother some 250 miles away.  \nShe doesn't have the opportunity to see her very often, and this is important to her \n   Their differences could be the ca use of a major negative experience. \n   \"The plans are set.  The boys are excited.  We should go on the fishing trip,\" he says. \n   \"But we don't know how much longer my mother  will be around, and I want to be by her,\" she \nreplies.  \"This is our only opportuni ty to have enough time to do that.\" \n   \"All year long we've looked forward to this one-week vacation.  The boys would be miserable \nsitting around grandmother's house for a week.  Th ey'd drive everybody crazy.  Besides, your \nmother's not that sick.  And she has your sister  less than a mile away to take care of her.\" \n   \"She's my mother, too.  I want to be with her.\"    \"You could phone her every night.  And we're planning to spend time with her at the Christmas \nfamily reunion.  Remember?\"    \"That's not for five more months.  We don't even  know if she'll still be here by then.  Besides, she \nneeds me, and she wants me.\"    \"She's being well taken care of.  Besides, the boys and I need you, too.\"    \"My mother is more important than fishing.\"    \"Your husband and sons are mo re important than your mother.\" \n   As they disagree, back and forth, they finally may come up with some kind of compromise.  They \nmay decide to split up -- he takes the boys fishing at the lake while she visits her mother.  And they \nboth feel guilty and unhappy.  The boys sense it, and it affects their enjoyment of the vacation. \n   The husband may give in to his wife, but he does  it grudgingly.  And con sciously or unconsciously, \nhe produces evidence to fulfill his prophecy of how miserable the week will be for everyone. \n   The wife may give in to her husband, bu t she's withdrawn and overreactive to any new \ndevelopments in her mother's health  situation.  If her mother were to become seriously ill and die, the \nhusband could never forgive himself, and she couldn't forgive him either. \n   Whatever compromise they finally agree on, it could be rehearsed over the years as evidence of \ninsensitivity, neglect, or a bad priority decision on ei ther part.  It could be a source of contention for \nyears and could even polarize the family.  Many marriages that once were beautiful and soft and \nspontaneous and loving have deteriorated to the level of a hostility through a seri es of incidents just like \nthis.    The husband and wife see the situation differently.  And that di fference can polarize them, separate \nthem, create wedges in the relationship.  Or it can bring them closer together on a higher level.  If they have cultivated the habits of  effective interdependence, they a pproach their differences from an \nentirely different paradigm.  Their co mmunication is on a higher level. \n   Because they have a high Emotional Bank Acco unt, they have trust and open communication in \ntheir marriage.  Because they Think Win-Win, they believe in a Third Alternative, a solution that is \nmutually beneficial and is better than what either of them originally proposed.  Because they listen \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t",

Fishing for the A Third Alternative     To get a better idea of how our level of communication affects our interdependent effectiveness, \nenvision the following scenario.    It's vacation time, and a husband wants to take his family out to the lake country to enjoy camping \nand fishing.  This is important to him; he's been planning it all year.  He's made reservations at a \ncottage on the lake and arranged to rent a boat, and his sons are really excited about going. \n   His wife, however, wants to use the vacation time  to visit her ailing mother some 250 miles away.  \nShe doesn't have the opportunity to see her very often,",

In searching for the \"middle\" or higher way, this husband and wife rea lize that their love, their \nrelationship, is part of their synergy    As they communicate, the husband really, deeply  feels his wife's desire, her need to be with her \nmother.

So they pool those desires.  And they're not on opposite sides of the problem.

The area \nwouldn't be as nice, but we could still be outdoor s and meet other needs as  well.  And the boys \nwouldn't be climbing the walls.  We could even plan  some recreational activities with the cousins, \naunts, and uncles, which would be an added benefit.\"    They synergize.  They communicate back and fo rth until they come up with a solution they both \nfeel good about.  It's better than the solutions eith er of them originally proposed.  It's better than \ncompromise.  It's a synergistic solution that builds P and PC. \n   Instead of a transaction, it's a transformation.  They get what they both really want and build their \nrelationship in the process.  Negative Synergy     Seeking the Third Alternative is  a major Paradigm Shift from the di chotomous, either/or mentality.  \nBut look at the difference in results.    How much negative energy is typically expend ed when people try to solve problems or make \ndecisions in an interdependent reality? How much time is spent in confessing other people's sins, \npoliticking, rivalry, interpersonal conflict, protec ting one's backside, masterminding, and second \nguessing? It's like trying to drive down the road wi th one foot on the gas and the other foot on the \nbrake.    And instead of getting a foot off the brake, most people give it more gas.  They try to apply more \npressure, more eloquence, more logical in formation to strength en their position. \n   The problem is that highly dependent people are trying to succeed in an interdependent reality.  \nThey're either dependent on borrowing strength fr om position power and th ey go for win-lose or \nthey're dependent on being popular with others an d they go for lose-win.  They may talk win-win \ntechnique, but they don't really wa nt to listen; they want to manipu late.

Sameness is not oneness; uniformity is \nnot unity.  Unity, or oneness, is complement ariness, not sameness.  Sameness is uncreative...and \nboring.  The essence of synergy is to value the differences.    I've come to believe that the key to interperso nal synergy is intrapersonal synergy, that is synergy \nwithin ourselves.  The heart of interpersonal syner gy is embodied in the prin ciples in the first three \nhabits, which give the internal security sufficient to handle the risks of being open and vulnerable.

So I intervened and said, \"Is \nthis kind of how it goes in your relationship?\"    \"Every day, Stephen,\" he replied.    \"It's the story of our marriage,\" she sighed.    I looked at the two of them and the though t crossed my mind that they were two half-brained \npeople living together.  \"Do yo u have any children?\" I asked. \n   \"Yes, two.\"    \"Really?\" I asked incredulously.  \"How did you do it?\"    \"What do you mean how did we do it?\"    \"You were synergistic!\" I said.  \"One plus one usually equals two.  But you made one plus one \nequal four.  Now that's synergy.  The whole is grea ter than the sum of the parts.  So how did you do \nit?\"    \"You know how we did it,\" he replied.    \"You must have valued the differences!\" I exclaimed.  Valuing the Differences     Valuing the differences is the essence of syne rgy -- the mental, the emotional, the psychological \ndifferences between people.  And the key to valuing th ose differences is to realize that all people see \nthe world, not as it is, but as they are.    If I think I see the world as it is, why would I want to value the differences? Why would I even want \nto bother with someone who's \"off t rack\"? My paradigm is that I am objective; I see the world as it is.  \nEveryone else is buried by the minutia, but I see the larger picture.  That's why they call me a supervisor -- I have super vision.    If that's my paradigm, then I will never be  effectively interdependent, or even effectively \nindependent, for that matter.  I will be limited  by the paradigms of my own conditioning. \n   The person who is truly effective has the hum ility and reverence to recognize his own perceptual \nlimitations and to appreciate the rich resources av ailable through interaction with the hearts and minds \nof other human beings.  That person values the differences because those differences add to his \nknowledge, to his understanding of reality.  When  we're left to our own experiences, we constantly \nsuffer from a shortage of data.    Is it lo\ngical that two people can disa gree and that both can be ri ght? It's not lo gical: it's ps ycholo gical.  \nAnd it's very real.  You see the young lady; I see the old woman.  We're both looking at the same \npicture, and both of us are right.  We see th e same black lines, the sa me white spaces.  But we \ninterpret them differently because we've been  conditioned to interpret them differently. \n   And unless we value the differences in our pe rceptions, unless we value each other and give \ncredence to the possibility that we're both right, th at life is not always a di chotomous either/or, that \nthere are almost always Third Alternatives, we will never be able to transcend the limits of that \nT H E  S E V E N ",

I take my foot off the brake and release the ne gative energy you may have invested in defending a \nparticular position.  I create an environment for synergy.    The importance of valuing the difference is capt ured in an often-quoted fable called \"The Animal \nSchool,\" written by educator Dr. R. H. Reeves.    Once upon a time, the animals decided they must  do something heroic to meet the problems of a \n\"New World,\" so they organized a school.  They adop ted an activity curriculum consisting of running, \nclimbing, swimming, and flying.  To make it easier  to administer, all animals took all the subjects. \n   The duck was excellent in swimming, better in fa ct than his instructor, and made excellent grades in \nflying, but he was very poor in running.  Since he was low in running he had to stay after school and \nalso drop swimming to practice running.  This was kept up until his web feet were badly worn and he \nwas only average in swimming.  But average was ac ceptable in school, so nobody worried about that \nexcept the duck.    The rabbit started at the top of the class in running, but had a nervous breakdown because of so \nmuch makeup in swimming.    The squirrel was excellent in climbing until he developed frustrations in the flying class where his \nteacher made him start from the ground up instea d of from the tree-top down.  He also developed \ncharley horses from over-exertion and he got a C in climbing and a D in running. \n   The eagle was a problem child and had to be discip lined severely.  In climbing class he beat all the \nothers to the top of the tree, but insisted on using his own way of getting there.    At the end of the year, an abnormal eel that co uld swim exceedingly well and also could run, climb \nand fly a little had the highest average and was valedictorian.    The prairie dogs stayed out of school and fought  the tax levy because the administration would not \nadd digging and burrowing to the curriculum.  They apprenticed their children to the badger and later \njoined the groundhogs and gophers to start a successful private school. \n Force Field Analysis     In an interdependent situation, synergy is part icularly powerful in dealing with negative forces that \nwork against growth and change.    Sociologist Kurt Lewin developed a \"Force Fiel d Analysis\" model in which he described any current \nlevel of performance or being as a state of equ ilibrium between the drivin g forces that encourage \nupward movement and the restraining forces that discourage it.    Driving forces generally are positive, reasonable, logical, conscious, and economic.  In juxtaposition, \nrestraining forces are often negative , emotional, illogical, unconscious, and social/psychological.  Both \nsets of forces are very real and must be taken into account in dealing with change. \n   In a family, for example, you have a certain \"cli mate\" in the home -- a cert ain level of positive or \nnegative interaction, of feeling safe or unsafe in expr essing feelings or talking about concerns, of respect \nor disrespect in communication among family members. \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E",

Increasing the driving forces may bring results -- for a while.  But as long as the restraining forces \nare there, it becomes increasingly harder.

You unfreeze them, loosen them up, \nand create new insights that actually transform thos e restraining forces into driving ones.  You involve \npeople in the problem, immerse them in it, so that they soak it in an d feel it is their problem and they \ntend to become an important part of the solution.    As a result, new goals, shared goals, are create d, and the whole enterprise moves upward, often in \nways that no one could have anticipated.  And the excitement contained within that movement creates \na new culture.  The people involved in it are en meshed in each other's humanity and empowered by \nnew, fresh thinking, by new creative  alternatives and opportunities. \n   I've been involved several times in negotiatio ns between people who were angry at each other and \nhired lawyers to defend their positions.  And all that did was to exacerbate the problem because the \ninterpersonal communication deteriorated as it went through the legal process.  But the trust level was \nso low that the parties felt they had no other alternative than to take the issues to court. \n   \"Would you be interested in going for a win-win so lution that both parties f eel really good about?\" I \nwould ask.    The response was usually affirmative, but mo st people didn't really think it was possible. \n   \"If I can get the other party to agree, would you be willing to start the process of really communicating with each other?\"    Again, the answer was usually \"yes.\"    The results in almost every case have been astounding.  Problems that had been legally and \npsychologically wrangled about for months have been settled in a matter of a few hours or days.  Most \nof the solutions weren't the courthouse compromise solutions either; they were synergistic, better than \nthe solutions proposed independently by either party.   And, in most cases, the relationships continued \neven though it had appeared in the beginning that the trust level was so low and the rupture in the \nrelationship so large as to be almost irreparable.    At one of our development programs, an execut ive reported a situation where a manufacturer was \nbeing sued by a longtime industrial customer for lack of performance.  Both part ies felt totally justified \nin the rightness of their position and perceived each  other as unethical and completely untrustworthy. \n   As they began to practice Habit 5, two things became clear.  First, early communication problems \nresulted in a misunderstanding which was later ex acerbated by accusations and counteraccusations.  \nSecond, both were initially acting in good faith and didn't like the cost and ha ssle of a legal fight, but \nsaw no other way out.    Once these two things became clear, the spirit  of Habits 4, 5, and 6 took over, the problem was \nrapidly resolved, and the relationship continues to prosper.    In another circumstance, I received an early morning phone call from a land developer desperately \nsearching for help.

It was a chicken-and-egg problem \nwith undercapitalization.    In the meantime, the project was languishing.  The streets were beginning to look like weed fields, \nand the owners of the few homes that  had been built were up in arms as  they saw their property values \ndrop.  The city was also upset over the \"prime land\" project falling behind schedule and becoming an eyesore.  Tens of thousands of dollars in legal costs had already been sp ent by the bank and the \ndeveloper and the case wasn't scheduled to come to court for several months. \n   In desperation, this developer reluctantly agreed to try the principles of Habits 4, 5, and 6.  He arranged a meeting with even more  reluctant bank officials. \n   The meeting started at 8 A.M.  in one of the bank conference rooms.  The tension and mistrust \nwere palpable.  The attorney for th e bank had committed the bank offici als to say nothing.  They were \nonly to listen and he alone would speak.  He wanted nothing to happen that would compromise the bank's position in court.    For the first hour and a half, I taught Habits 4, 5, and 6.  At 9:30 I went to the blackboard and wrote \ndown the bank's concerns based on our prior understa nding.  Initially the bank officials said nothing, \nbut the more we communicated win-win intentions an d sought first to understand, the more they \nopened up to explain and clarify.    As they began to feel understood, the whol e atmosphere changed and a sense of momentum, of \nexcitement over the prospect of peacefully settl ing the problem was clearl y evident.  Over the \nattorney's objections the bank officials opened up  even more, even about personal concerns.  \"When \nwe walk out of here the first thing the bank presid ent will say is, 'Did we get our money?' What are we \ngoing to say?\"    By 11:00, the bank officers were still convinced of their rightness, but they felt understood and were \nno longer defensive and officious.  At that point, they wer e sufficiently open to listen to the developer's \nconcerns, which we wrote down on th e other side of the blackboard.  This resulted in deeper mutual \nunderstanding and a collective awareness of ho w poor early communication had resulted in \nmisunderstanding and unrealistic expectations, and how continuous communicat ion in a win-win spirit \ncould have prevented the subsequent major problems from developing.    The shared sense of both chronic and acute pain  combined with a sense of genuine progress kept \neveryone communicating.  By noon, when the meetin g was scheduled to end, the people were positive, \ncreative, and synergistic and wanted to keep talking.    The very first recommendation made by the de veloper was seen as a beginning win-win approach \nby all.  It was synergized on and improved, and at  12:45 P.M.  the developer and the two bank officers \nleft with a plan to present together to the Home Owners' Association and the city.  Despite subsequent \ncomplicating developments, the legal fight was ab orted and the building project continued to a \nsuccessful conclusion.    I am not suggesting that people should not use le gal processes.  Some situations absolutely require \nit.  But I see it as a court of last, not first, resort.  If it is used too early, even in a preventive sense, \nsometimes fear and the legal paradigm create subseq uent thought and action processes that are not \nsynergistic.  All Nature is Synergistic     Ecology is a word which basically describes the synergism in nature -- everything is related to everything else.  It's in the relati onship that creative powers are maxi mized, just as the real power in \nthese Seven Habits is in their relationship to each other, not just in the individual habits themselves. \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F ",

You see it differently.\" You don't have to ag ree with them; you can simply affirm them.  And \nyou can seek to understand.    When you see only two alternatives -- yours an d the \"wrong\" one -- you can look for a synergistic \nThird Alternative.  There's almost always a Thir d Alternative, and if you work with a win-win \nphilosophy and really seek to un derstand, you usually can find a solution that will be better for \neveryone concerned.

Consider ways in \nwhich those differences might be used as stepping-s tones to Third Alternative solutions.  Perhaps you \ncould seek out his or her views on a current projec t or problem, valuing the different views you are \nlikely to hear.    2.  Make a list of people who irritate you.  Do  they represent different views that could lead to \nsynergy if you had greater intrinsic security and valued the differences.    3.  Identify a situation",
