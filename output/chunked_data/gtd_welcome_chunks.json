Many of \nthese businesspeople are successful because the cri ses they solve \nand the opportunities they take advantage of are bi gger than the \nproblems they allow and create in their own offices  and briefcases. \nBut given the pace of business and life today, the equation is in \nquestion. \nOn the one hand, we need proven tools that can help  people \nfocus their energies strategically and tactically w ithout letting \nanything fall through the cracks. On the other, we need to create \nwork environments and skills that will keep the mos t invested \npeople from burning out due to stress. We need posi tive work- \nstyle standards that will attract and retain the be st and brightest. \nWe know this information is sorely needed in organi zations. \nIt's also needed in schools, where our kids are sti ll not being \ntaught how to process information, how to focus on outcomes, or \nwhat actions to take to make them happen. And for a ll of us indi- \nvidually, it's needed so we can take advantage of a ll the opportuni- \nties we're given to add value to our world in a sus tainable, \nself-nurturing way. \nThe power, simplicity, and effectiveness of what I' m talking about \nin Getting Things Done are best experienced as experiences, in real \ntime, with real situations in your real world. Nece ssarily, the book \nmust put the essence of this dynamic art of workflo w manage- \nment and personal productivity into a linear format . I've tried \nto organize it in such a way as to give you both th e inspiring big- \npicture view and a taste of immediate results as yo u go along. \nThe book is divided into three parts. Part 1 descri bes the \nwhole game, providing a brief overview of the syste m and an \nexplanation of why it's unique and timely, and then  presenting the \nbasic methodologies themselves in their most conden sed and \nxiii \nxiv WELCOME TO GETTING THINGS DONE \nbasic form. Part 2 shows you how to implement the s ystem. \nIt's your personal coaching, step by step, on the n itty-gritty appli- \ncation of the models. Part 3 goes even deeper, desc ribing the \nsubtler and more profound results you can expect wh en you incor- \nporate the methodologies and models into your work and your \nlife. \nI want you to hop in. I want you to test this stuff  out, even \nchallenge it. I want you to find out for yourself t hat what I prom- \nise is not only possible but instantly accessible t o you personally. \nAnd I want you to know that everything I propose is  easy to do. It \ninvolves no new skills at all. You already know how  to focus, how \nto write things down, how to decide on outcomes and  actions, and \nhow to review options and make choices. You'll vali date that \nmany of the things you've been doing instinctively and intuitively \nall along are right. I'll give you ways to leverage those basic skills \ninto new plateaus of effectiveness. I want to inspi re you to put all \nthis into a new behavior set that will blow your mi nd. \nThroughout the book I refer to my coaching and semi nars \non this material.
