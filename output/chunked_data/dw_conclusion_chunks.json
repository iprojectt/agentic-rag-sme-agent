I also signed a \ndeal to write my fourth book, So Good\n\nThey Can’ t Ignore You,  during this \nperiod— a project, of course, that soon \nlevied its own intense demands on my \ntime.\nTo compensate for these new \nconstraints, I refined my ability to work \ndeeply. Among other methods, I began to \nmore carefully block out deep work \nhours and preserve them against \nincursion. I also developed an ability to \ncarefully work through thoughts during \nthe many hours I spent on foot each week \n(a boon to my productivity), and became \nobsessive about finding disconnected \nlocations conducive to focus. During the \nsummer, for example, I would often \nwork under the dome in Barker\n\nEngineering library—a pleasingly\ncavernous location that becomes too \ncrowded when class is in session, and \nduring the winter, I sought more obscure \nlocations for some silence, eventually \ndeveloping a preference for the small \nbut well-appointed Lewis Music \nLibrary. At some point, I even bought a \n$50 high-end grid-lined lab notebook to \nwork on mathematical proofs, believing \nthat its expense would induce more care \nin my thinking.\nI ended up surprised by how well \nthis recommitment to depth ended up \nworking. After I’d taken a job as a \ncomputer science professor at \nGeorgetown University in the fall of\n\n2011, my obligations did in fact \ndrastically increase. But I had been \ntraining for this moment. Not only did I \npreserve my research productivity; it \nactually improved.  My previous rate of \ntwo good papers a year, which I \nmaintained as an unencumbered graduate \nstudent, leapt to four good papers a year, \non average, once I became a much more \nencumbered professor.\nImpressive as this was to me, \nhowever, I was soon to learn that I had \nnot yet reached the limits of what deep \nwork could produce. This lesson would \ncome during my third year as a \nprofessor. During my third year at \nGeorgetown, which spanned the fall of\n\n2013 through the summer of 2014, I \nturned my attention back to my deep \nwork habits, searching for more \nopportunities to improve. A big reason \nfor this recommitment to depth is the \nbook you’re currently reading—most of \nwhich was written during this period. \nWriting a seventy-thousand-word book \nmanuscript, of course, placed a sudden \nnew constraint on my already busy \nschedule, and I wanted to make sure my \nacademic productivity didn’t take a \ncorresponding hit. Another reason I \nturned back to depth was the looming \ntenure process. I had a year or two of \npublications left before my tenure case \nwas submitted. This was the time, in\n\nother words, to make a statement about \nmy abilities (especially given that my \nwife and I were planning on growing our \nfamily with a second child in the final \nyear before tenure). The final reason I \nturned back to depth was more personal \nand (admittedly) a touch petulant. I had \napplied and been rejected for a well- \nrespected grant that many of my \ncolleagues were receiving. I was upset \nand embarrassed, so I decided that \ninstead of just complaining or \nwallowing in self-doubt, I would \ncompensate for losing the grant by \nincreasing the rate and impressiveness \nof my publications—allowing them to \ndeclare on my behalf that I actually did\n\nknow what I was doing, even if this one \nparticular grant application didn’t go my \nway.\nI was already an adept deep worker, \nbut these three forces drove me to push \nthis habit to an extreme. I became \nruthless in turning down time-consuming \ncommitments and began to work more in \nisolated locations outside my office. I \nplaced a tally of my deep work hours in \na prominent position near my desk and \ngot upset when it failed to grow at a fast \nenough rate. Perhaps most impactful, I \nreturned to my MIT habit of working on \nproblems in my head whenever a good \ntime presented itself—be it walking the \ndog or commuting. Whereas earlier, I\n\ntended to increase my deep work only as \na deadline approached, this year I was \nrelentless—most every day of most \nevery week I was pushing my mind to \ngrapple with results of consequence, \nregardless of whether or not a specific \ndeadline was near.

But this \nexperience reinforces the point that \nopened this conclusion: Deep work is \nway more  powerful than most people \nunderstand. It’s a commitment to this \nskill that allowed Bill Gates to make the\n\nmost of an unexpected opportunity to \ncreate a new industry, and that allowed \nme to double my academic productivity \nthe same year I decided to concurrently \nwrite a book. To leave the distracted \nmasses to join the focused few, I’m \narguing, is a transformative experience.\nThe deep life, of course, is not for \neverybody. It requires hard work and \ndrastic changes to your habits. For many, \nthere’s a comfort in the artificial \nbusyness of rapid e-mail messaging and \nsocial media posturing, while the deep \nlife demands that you leave much of that \nbehind. There’s also an uneasiness that \nsurrounds any effort to produce the best \nthings you’re capable of producing, as\n\nthis forces you to confront the possibility \nthat your best is not (yet) that good. It’s \nsafer to comment on our culture than to \nstep into the Rooseveltian ring and \nattempt to wrestle it into something \nbetter.\nBut if you’re willing to sidestep \nthese comforts and fears, and instead \nstruggle to deploy your mind to its fullest \ncapacity to create things that matter, then \nyou’ll discover, as others have before \nyou, that depth generates a life rich with \nproductivity and meaning. In Part 1, I \nquoted writer Winifred Gallagher \nsaying, “I’ll live the focused life, \nbecause it’s the best kind there is.” I \nagree. So does Bill Gates.
