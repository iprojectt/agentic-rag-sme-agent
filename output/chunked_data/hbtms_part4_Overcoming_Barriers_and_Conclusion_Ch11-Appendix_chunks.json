They should learn to say “No”, especially to inappropriate orthoughtless requests. Dr Mackenzie suggests four steps to say NO and it is\npresented in the BOX on the next page for quick reference.\nDr. Mackenzie’s Four Steps to Saying “No.”\n1. Listen\nThis lets the requesting person know you’re giving full attention to the request and lets\nyou fully understand what is being asked.\n2. Say “No” politely but firmly right away\nDon’t build false hopes with wishy-washy answers.\n3. Give your reasons, if appropriate\nYour reasons may include your priorities, your schedule, etc. This reinforces your\ncredibility.\n4. Offer alternatives, if possible\nDemonstrate your good faith by suggesting other ways to meet the person’s need.\nThere are many ways to say “No” after listening to a request that you simplycannot handle.\nDr. Mackenzie offers a few:\n• “I’m sorry, my other commitments just won’t permit me to take on another project rightnow.”\n• “You know, on New Year’s Day I promised my family I wouldn’t take on anything else\nthis year. I’ve been neglecting them too much.”• “Thanks for the compliment, but I’m afraid I’ll have to decline. maybe next year.”\n• If a request catches you off-guard, don’t say anything until you count to ten first.\nHandbook on Time Management Skills\n47m. Leaving tasks unfinished:  Managers must take time log and assess the impact of\nleaving tasks unfinished. They should set deadlines on all important tasks to provide\nincentive to complete them. They should get organized to permit effective control oftasks. They should recognize that sound organization saves time in retrieving\ninformation, processing decisions, and maintaining control over projects.\nn. Lack of Self-Discipline:  When a manager switches priorities of his team, he makes\nself-discipline difficult to practice. S/he should take time log to record frequency, assess\ncost, discuss with colleagues to seek ways of reducing problem.\nSoft Skills for Public Managers\n48Time-Wasters: Causes & Solutions\nLack of planning Failure to see the\nbenefit of planningRecognize that planning may\ntake time but it saves time\nand effort in the long run.\nLack of planningAction-oriented\n(perhaps not action-oriented\notherwise the above point is\nsimilar to this)Emphasize results,\nnot activity.\nLack of planning Success withoutRecognize that success is\noften in spite of, not because\nof, methods.\nLack of priorities Lack of goals and\nobjectivesWrite down goals and\nobjectives.

It is said\nthat time and tide waits for none so our attempts would be to make the best use of time\nand prevent others from wasting our time too. This chapter winds up all our observationson time management in this book. It summarizes as to what causes us to waste our time\nand suggests solutions to save time as much as possible. It also offers tips to make the\nbest use of time. As with all the precious resources, time is a scarce resource. The wisdomlies in making the most of it.

How to Get Control of Your Time and Your Life\nSoft Skills for Public Managers\n56Appendix\nTime Management Facts and Figures\n80% of “crisis management” events are preventable.One hour of planning will save 10 hours of doing.\nGood time managers do not allocate their time to those who “demand” it, but\nrather to those who “deserve” it.\nThe most powerful word in our time management vocabulary is “no.”\nDelegation is an unlimited method to multiply time for achieving results.\nThe hardest part about delegation is simply letting go “If you want a job done\nright, you have to do it yourself.”\nDr. Donald E. Wetmore -Productivity Institute\nTime Management Facts and Figures\n- Nine out of 10 people daydream in meetings.\n- 60% of meeting attendees take notes to appear as if they are listening.\n- When someone is asking for our time for a meeting, 80% of the time there is an\nalternate date and time that will be acceptable.\nDr. Donald E.
