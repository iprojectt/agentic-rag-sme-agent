You'r e probably \nalready using some version of most of them. \nThe Collection Success Factors \nUnfortunately, merely having an in-basket doesn't m ake it func- \ntional. Most people do have collection devices of some sort, but \nusually they're more or less out of control. Let's examine the three \nrequirements to make the collection phase work: \n1 |   Every open loop must be in your collection sys tem and out \nof your head. \n2 |   You must have as few collection buckets as you can get by with. \n3 |   You must empty them regularly. \nGet It All Out of Your Head \nIf you're still trying to keep track of too many th ings in your RAM, \nyou likely won't be motivated to use and empty your  in-baskets \nwith integrity. Most people are relatively careless  about these tools \nbecause they know they don't represent discrete, wh ole systems \nanyway: there's an incomplete set of things in thei r in-basket and \nan incomplete set in their mind, and they're not ge tting any payoff \nfrom either one, so their thinking goes. It's like trying to play pin- \nball on a machine that has big holes in the table, so the balls keep \nfalling out: there's little motivation to keep play ing the game. \nThese collection tools should become part of your l ife-style. \nKeep them close by so no matter where you are you c an collect a \npotentially valuable thought-—think of them as bein g as indis- \npensable as your toothbrush or your driver's licens e or your glasses. \nMinimize the Number of Collection Buckets \nYou should have as many in-baskets as you need and as few as you \ncan get by with. You need this function to be avail able to you in \n29 \nTHE ART OF GETTING THINGS DONE  I  PART ONE \nevery context, since things you'll want to capture may show up \nalmost anywhere. If you have too many collection zo nes, however, \nyou won't be able to process them easily or consist ently. \nAn excess of collection buckets is seldom a problem  on the \nhigh-tech end; the real improvement opportunity for  most people \nis on the low-tech side, primarily in the areas of note-taking and \nphysical in-basket collection. Written notes need t o be corralled \nand processed instead of left lying embedded in sta cks, note- \nbooks, and drawers. Paper materials need to be funn eled into \nphysical in-baskets instead of being scattered over  myriad piles in \nall the available corners of your world. \nImplementing   standard   tools   for   capturing \nideas and input will become more and more critical \nas your life and work become more sophisticated. As\nyou proceed in your career, for instance, you'll pr oba- \nbly notice that your best ideas about work will not\ncome to you at work.

Simply trac king that on the \ncalendar is sufficient. \nDay-Specific Actions These are things that you need to do some- \ntime on a certain day, but not necessarily at a specific time. Perhaps \nyou told Mioko you would call her on Friday to chec k that the \n39 \nTHE ART OF GETTING THINGS DONE  I  PART ONE \nreport you're sending her is OK. She won't have the  report until \nThursday, and she's leaving the country on Saturday , so Friday is \nthe time window for taking the action—but anytime F riday will \nbe fine. That should be tracked on the calendar for  Friday but not \ntied to any particular time slot—it should just go on the day. \nIt's \nuseful to have a calendar on which you can note bot h time- \nspecific and day-specific actions. \nDay-Specific Information The calendar is also the place to keep \ntrack of things you want to know about on specific days—not nec- \nessarily actions you'll have to take but rather information that may \nbe useful on a certain date. This might include dir ections for \nappointments, activities that other people (family or staff) will be \ninvolved in then, or events of interest. It's also helpful to put \nshort-term \"tickler\" information here, too, such as  a reminder to \ncall someone after the day they return from a vacat ion. \nNo More \"Daily To-Do\" Lists   Those three things are what go on \nthe calendar, and nothing else! I know this is here sy to traditional \ntime-management training, which has almost uni- \nversally taught that the \"daily to-do list\" is key.  But \nsuch lists don't work, for two reasons. \nFirst, constant new input and shifting tactical \npriorities reconfigure daily work so consistently t hat \nit's virtually impossible to nail down to-do items \nahead of time. Having a working game plan as a ref-\nerence point is always useful, but it must be able to be \nrenegotiated at any moment. Trying to keep a list i n writing on \nthe calendar, which must then be rewritten on anoth er day if \nitems don't get done, is demoralizing and a waste o f time. The \n\"Next Actions\" lists I advocate will hold all of th ose action \nreminders, even the most time-sensitive ones. And t hey won't \nhave to be rewritten daily. \nSecond, if there's something on a daily to-do list that doesn't",

In that case it makes sense to subdivide your \n\"Next Actions\" list into categories, such as \"Calls \" to \nmake when you're at a phone or \"Project Head Ques- \ntions\" to be asked at your weekly briefing. \nNonactionable Items \nYou need well-organized, discrete systems to handle  the items \nthat require no action as well as the ones that do.  No-action sys- \ntems fall into three categories: trash, incubation, and reference. \n41 Everything should \nbe made as simple \nas possible, but not \nsimpler. \n—Albert Einstein \n42 THE ART OF GETTING THINGS DONE  I  PART ONE \nTrash \nTrash should be self-evident. Throw away anything that ha s no \npotential future action or reference value. If you leave this stuff \nmixed in with other categories, it will seriously u ndermine the \nsystem. \nIncubation \nThere are two other groups of things besides trash that require no \nimmediate action, but this stuff you will want to keep. Here again, \nit's critical that you separate nonactionable from actionable items; \notherwise you will tend to go numb to your piles, s tacks, and lists \nand not know where to start or what needs to be don e. \nSay you pick up something from a memo, or read an e -mail, \nthat gives you an idea for a project you might want to do someday, \nbut not now. You'll want to be reminded of it again  later so you \ncan reassess the option of doing something about it  in the future. \nFor example, a brochure arrives in the mail for the  upcoming sea- \nson of your local symphony. On a quick browse, you see that the \nprogram that really interests you is still four mon ths away—too \ndistant for you to move on it yet (you're not sure what your travel \nschedule will be that far out), but if you are in town, you'd like to \ngo. What should you do about that? \nThere are two kinds of \"incubate\" systems that coul d work \nfor this kind of thing: \"Someday/Maybe\" lists and a  \"tickler\" file. \n\"Someday/Maybe\" It can be useful and inspiring to maintain an \nongoing list of things you might want to do at some  point but not \nnow.
