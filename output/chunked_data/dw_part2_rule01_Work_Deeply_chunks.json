Dewane is \nan architecture professor, and therefore \nlikes to explore the intersection between \nthe conceptual and the concrete. The \nEudaimonia Machine is a good example \nof this intersection. The machine, which\n\ntakes its name from the ancient Greek \nconcept of eudaimonia  (a state in which \nyou’re achieving your full human \npotential), turns out to be a building. \n“The goal of the machine,” David \nexplained, “is to create a setting where \nthe users can get into a state of deep \nhuman flourishing—creating work that’s \nat the absolute extent of their personal \nabilities.” It is, in other words, a space \ndesigned for the sole purpose of \nenabling the deepest possible deep \nwork. I was, as you might expect, \nintrigued.\nAs Dewane explained the machine to \nme, he grabbed a pen to sketch its \nproposed layout. The structure is a one-\n\nstory narrow rectangle made up of five \nrooms, placed in a line, one af ter \nanother. There’s no shared hallway: you \nhave to pass through one room to get to \nthe next. As Dewane explains, “[The \nlack of circulation] is critical because it \ndoesn’t allow you to bypass any of the \nspaces as you get deeper into the \nmachine.”\nThe first room you enter when \ncoming off the street is called the \ngallery. In Dewane’s plan, this room \nwould contain examples of deep work \nproduced in the building. It’s meant to \ninspire users of the machine, creating a \n“culture of healthy stress and peer \npressure.”\n\nAs you leave the gallery, you next \nenter the salon. In here, Dewane \nimagines access to high-quality coffee \nand perhaps even a full bar. There are \nalso couches and Wi-Fi. The salon is \ndesigned to create a mood that “hovers \nbetween intense curiosity and \nargumentation.” This is a place to \ndebate, “brood,” and in general work \nthrough the ideas that you’ll develop \ndeeper in the machine.\nBeyond the salon you enter the \nlibrary. This room stores a permanent \nrecord of all work produced in the \nmachine, as well as the books and other \nresources used in this previous work. \nThere will be copiers and scanners for\n\ngathering and collecting the information \nyou need for your project. Dewane \ndescribes the library as “the hard drive \nof the machine.”\nThe next room is the office space. It \ncontains a standard conference room \nwith a whiteboard and some cubicles \nwith desks. “The office,” Dewane \nexplains, “is for low-intensity activity.” \nTo use our terminology, this is the space \nto complete the shallow efforts required \nby your project. Dewane imagines an \nadministrator with a desk in the office \nwho could help its users improve their \nwork habits to optimize their efficiency.\nThis brings us to the final room of the \nmachine, a collection of what Dewane\n\ncalls “deep work chambers” (he adopted \nthe term “deep work” from my articles \non the topic). Each chamber is \nconceived to be six by ten feet and \nprotected by thick soundproof walls \n(Dewane’s plans call for eighteen inches \nof insulation). “The purpose of the deep \nwork chamber is to allow for total focus \nand uninterrupted work flow,” Dewane \nexplains. He imagines a process in \nwhich you spend ninety minutes inside, \ntake a ninety-minute break, and repeat \ntwo or three times— at which point your \nbrain will have achieved its limit of \nconcentration for the day.\nFor now, the Eudaimonia Machine \nexists only as a collection of\n\narchitectural drawings, but even as a \nplan, its potential to support impactful \nwork excites Dewane. “[This design] \nremains, in my mind, the most interesting \npiece of architecture I’ve ever \nproduced,” he told me.\nIn an ideal world—one in which the true \nvalue of deep work is accepted and \ncelebrated—we’d all have access to \nsomething like the Eudaimonia Machine. \nPerhaps not David Dewane’s exact \ndesign, but, more generally speaking, a \nwork environment (and culture) \ndesigned to help us extract as much \nvalue as possible from our brains. \nUnfortunately, this vision is far from our\n\ncurrent reality.

Most people \nrecognize that this urge can complicate \nefforts to concentrate on hard things, but \nmost underestimate its regularity and \nstrength.\nConsider a 2012 study, led by \npsychologists Wilhelm Hofmann and\n\nRoy Baumeister, that outfitted 205 adults \nwith beepers that activated at randomly \nselected times (this is the experience \nsampling method discussed in Part 1). \nWhen the beeper sounded, the subject \nwas asked to pause for a moment to \nreflect on desires that he or she was \ncurrently feeling or had felt in the last \nthirty minutes, and then answer a set of \nquestions about these desires. After a \nweek, the researchers had gathered more \nthan 7,500 samples. Here’s the short \nversion of what they found: People fight  \ndesires all day long.  As Baumeister \nsummarized in his subsequent book, \nWillpower  (co-authored with the science \nwriter John Tierney): “Desire turned out\n\nto be the norm, not the exception.”\nThe five most common desires these \nsubjects fought include, not surprisingly, \neating, sleeping, and sex. But the top five \nlist also included desires for “taking a \nbreak f rom [hard] work... checking e­\nmail and social networking sites, surfing \nthe web, listening to music, or watching \ntelevision.” The lure of the Internet and \ntelevision proved especially strong: The \nsubjects succeeded in resisting these \nparticularly addictive distractions only \naround half the time.\nThese results are bad news for this \nrule’s goal of helping you cultivate a \ndeep work habit. They tell us that you \ncan expect to be bombarded with the\n\ndesire to do anything but work deeply \nthroughout the day, and if you’re like the \nGerman subjects from the Hofmann and \nBaumeister study, these competing \ndesires will often win out. You might \nrespond at this point that you will \nsucceed where these subjects failed \nbecause you understand the importance \nof depth and will therefore be more \nrigorous in your will to remain \nconcentrated. This is a noble sentiment, \nbut the decades of research that \npreceded this study underscore its \nfutility. A now voluminous line of \ninquiry, initiated in a series of \npioneering papers also written by Roy \nBaumeister, has established the\n\nfollowing important (and at the time, \nunexpected) truth about willpower: You \nhave a finite amount o f willpower that  \nbecomes depleted as you use it.\nYour will, in other words, is not a \nmanifestation of your character that you \ncan deploy without limit; it’s instead like \na muscle that tires. This is why the \nsubjects in the Hofmann and Baumeister \nstudy had such a hard time fighting \ndesires—over time these distractions \ndrained their finite pool of willpower \nuntil they could no longer resist.

The \nsame will happen to you, regardless of \nyour intentions—unless, that is, you’re \nsmart about your habits.\nThis brings me to the motivating idea\n\nbehind the strategies that follow: The \nkey to developing a deep work habit is \nto move beyond good intentions and add \nroutines  and rituals  to your working life \ndesigned to minimize the amount of your \nlimited willpower necessary to \ntransition into and maintain a state of \nunbroken concentration. If you suddenly \ndecide, for example, in the middle of a \ndistracted af ternoon spent Web \nbrowsing, to switch your attention to a \ncognitively demanding task, you’ll draw \nheavily from your finite willpower to \nwrest your attention away from the \nonline shininess. Such attempts will \ntherefore frequently fail. On the other \nhand, if you deployed smart routines and\n\nrituals—perhaps a set time and quiet \nlocation used for your deep tasks each \nafternoon—you’d require much less \nwillpower to start and keep going. In the \nlong run, you’d therefore succeed with \nthese deep efforts far more often.\nWith this in mind, the six strategies \nthat follow can be understood as an \narsenal of routines and rituals designed \nwith the science of limited willpower in \nmind to maximize the amount of deep \nwork you consistently accomplish in \nyour schedule.

As I’ll detail \nin the next section, Knuth deploys a form \nof monasticism that prioritizes deep \nwork by trying to eliminate or minimize \nall other types of work. Chappell, by \ncontrast, deploys a rhythmic strategy in \nwhich he works for the same hours (five \nto seven thirty a.m.) every weekday \nmorning, without exception, before \nbeginning a workday punctuated by \nstandard distractions. Both approaches \nwork, but not universally. Knuth’s \napproach might make sense for someone \nwhose primary professional obligation \nis to think big thoughts, but if Chappell \nadopted a similar rejection of all things \nshallow, he’d likely lose his job.\n\nYou need your own philosophy for \nintegrating deep work into your \nprofessional life. (As argued in this \nrule’s introduction, attempting to \nschedule deep work in an ad hoc fashion \nis not an effective way to manage your \nlimited willpower.) But this example \nhighlights a general warning about this \nselection: You must be careful to choose \na philosophy that fits your specific \ncircumstances, as a mismatch here can \nderail your deep work habit before it has \na chance to solidify.

He’s \nfamous for many innovations in \ncomputer science, including, notably, the \ndevelopment of a rigorous approach to \nanalyzing algorithm performance. \nAmong his peers, however, Knuth also \nmaintains an aura of infamy for his\n\napproach to electronic communication.

If \nyou visit Knuth’s website at Stanford \nwith the intention of finding his e-mail \naddress, you’ll instead discover the \nfollowing note:\nI  have been a happy man ever  \nsince January 1, 1990, when I  no  \nlonger had an email address. I ’ d  \nused email since about 1975,  \nand it seems to me that 15 years  \no f email is plenty fo r one  \nlifetime. Email is a wonderful  \nthing fo r people whose role in  \nlife is to be on top o f things. But  \nnot fo r me; my role is to be on  \nthe bottom o f things. What I  do\n\ntakes long hours o f studying and  \nuninterruptible concentration.\nKnuth goes on to acknowledge that he \ndoesn’t intend to cut himself off \ncompletely from the world. He notes that \nwriting his books requires \ncommunication with thousands of people \nand that he wants to be responsive to \nquestions and comments. His solution? \nHe provides an address—a postal  \nmailing  address. He says that his \nadministrative assistant will sort through \nany letters arriving at that address and \nput aside those that she thinks are \nrelevant. Anything that’s truly urgent \nshe’ll bring to Knuth promptly, and\n\neverything else he’ll handle in a big \nbatch, once every three months or so.\nKnuth deploys what I call the \nmonastic philosophy  of deep work \nscheduling. This philosophy attempts to \nmaximize deep efforts by eliminating or \nradically minimizing shallow \nobligations.

He chose the former option, \nand this choice requires him to avoid as \nmuch as possible any source of shallow \nwork in his professional life. (This issue \nis so important to Stephenson that he \nwent on to explore its implications— \npositive and negative— in his 2008 \nscience fiction epic, Anathem , which \nconsiders a world where an intellectual \nelite live in monastic orders, isolated \nfrom the distracted masses and \ntechnology, thinking deep thoughts.)\nIn my experience, the monastic \nphilosophy makes many knowledge \nworkers defensive. The clarity with \nwhich its adherents identify their value\n\nto the world, I suspect, touches a raw \nnerve for those whose contribution to the \ninformation economy is more complex. \nNotice, of course, that “more complex” \ndoes not mean “lesser.” A high-level \nmanager, for example, might play a vital \nrole in the functioning of a billion-dollar \ncompany, even if she cannot point to \nsomething discrete, like a completed \nnovel, and say, “This is what I produced \nthis year.” Therefore, the pool of \nindividuals to whom the monastic \nphilosophy applies is limited—and \nthat’s okay. If you’re outside this pool, \nits radical simplicity shouldn’t evince \ntoo much envy. On the other hand, if \nyou’re inside this pool— someone whose\n\ncontribution to the world is discrete, \nclear, and individualize d*—then you \nshould give this philosophy serious \nconsideration, as it might be the deciding \nfactor between an average career and \none that will be remembered.\nThe Bimodal Philosophy of  \nDeep Work Scheduling\nThis book opened with a story about the \nrevolutionary psychologist and thinker \nCarl Jung. In the 1920s, at the same time \nthat Jung was attempting to break away \nfrom the strictures of his mentor, \nSigmund Freud, he began regular retreats\n\nto a rustic stone house he built in the \nwoods outside the small town of \nBollingen. When there, Jung would lock \nhimself every morning into a minimally \nappointed room to write without \ninterruption. He would then meditate and \nwalk in the woods to clarify his thinking \nin preparation for the next day’s writing. \nThese efforts, I argued, were aimed at \nincreasing the intensity of Jung’s deep \nwork to a level that would allow him to \nsucceed in intellectual combat with \nFreud and his many supporters.\nIn recalling this story I want to \nemphasize something important: Jung did \nnot deploy a monastic approach to deep \nwork. Donald Knuth and Neal\n\nStephenson, our examples from earlier, \nattempted to completely eliminate \ndistraction and shallowness from their \nprofessional lives. Jung, by contrast, \nsought this elimination only during the \nperiods he spent at his retreat. The rest \nof Jung’s time was spent in Zurich, \nwhere his life was anything but \nmonastic: He ran a busy clinical practice \nthat often had him seeing patients until \nlate at night; he was an active participant \nin the Zurich coffeehouse culture; and he \ngave and attended many lectures in the \ncity’s respected universities. (Einstein \nreceived his doctorate from one \nuniversity in Zurich and later taught at \nanother; he also, interestingly enough,\n\nknew Jung, and the two shared several \ndinners to discuss the key ideas of \nEinstein’s special relativity.) Jung’s life \nin Zurich, in other words, is similar in \nmany ways to the modern archetype of \nthe hyperconnected digital-age \nknowledge worker: Replace “Zurich” \nwith “San Francisco” and “letter” with \n“tweet” and we could be discussing \nsome hotshot tech CEO.\nJung’s approach is what I call the \nbimodal philosophy  of deep work. This \nphilosophy asks that you divide your \ntime, dedicating some clearly defined \nstretches to deep pursuits and leaving the \nrest open to everything else. During the \ndeep time, the bimodal worker will act\n\nmonastically— seeking intense and\nuninterrupted concentration. During the \nshallow time, such focus is not \nprioritized. This division of time \nbetween deep and open can happen on \nmultiple scales. For example, on the \nscale of a week, you might dedicate a \nfour-day weekend to depth and the rest \nto open time. Similarly, on the scale of a \nyear, you might dedicate one season to \ncontain most of your deep stretches (as \nmany academics do over the summer or \nwhile on sabbatical).\nThe bimodal philosophy believes \nthat deep work can produce extreme \nproductivity, but only if",

This is why the minimum unit of \ntime for deep work in this philosophy \ntends to be at least one full day. To put \naside a few hours in the morning, for \nexample, is too short to count as a deep \nwork stretch for an adherent of this \napproach.\nAt the same time, the bimodal \nphilosophy is typically deployed by \npeople who cannot succeed in the \nabsence of substantial commitments to \nnon-deep pursuits. Jung, for example, \nneeded his clinical practice to pay the \nbills and the Zurich coffeehouse scene to \nstimulate his thinking. The approach of\n\nshifting between two modes provides a \nway to serve both needs well.\nTo provide a more modern example \nof the bimodal philosophy in action, we \ncan once again consider Adam Grant, the \nWharton Business School professor \nwhose thoughtfulness about work habits \nwas first introduced in Part 1. As you \nmight recall, Grant’s schedule during his \nrapid rise through the professorship \nranks at Wharton provides a nice \nbimodality case study. On the scale of \nthe academic year, he stacked his \ncourses into one semester, so that he \ncould focus the other on deep work. \nDuring these deep semesters he then \napplied the bimodal approach on the\n\nweekly scale. He would, perhaps once \nor twice a month, take a period of two to \nfour days to become completely \nmonastic. He would shut his door, put an \nout-of-office auto-responder on his e­\nmail, and work on his research without \ninterruption. Outside of these deep \nsessions, Grant remained famously open \nand accessible. In some sense, he had to \nbe: His 2013 bestseller, Give and Take,  \npromotes the practice of giving of your \ntime and attention, without expectation \nof something in return, as a key strategy \nin professional advancement.\nThose who deploy the bimodal \nphilosophy of deep work admire the \nproductivity of the monastics but also\n\nrespect the value they receive from the \nshallow behaviors in their working \nlives. Perhaps the biggest obstacle to \nimplementing this philosophy is that \neven short periods of deep work require \na flexibility that many fear they lack in \ntheir current positions. If even an hour \naway from your inbox makes you \nuncomfortable, then certainly the idea of \ndisappearing for a day or more at a time \nwill seem impossible. But I suspect \nbimodal working is compatible with \nmore types of jobs than you might guess. \nEarlier, for example, I described a study \nby Harvard Business School professor \nLeslie Perlow. In this study, a group of \nmanagement consultants were asked to\n\ndisconnect for a full day each \nworkweek. The consultants were afraid \nthe client would rebel. It turned out that \nthe client didn’t care.

You’ll \nlike seeing that chain, especially when \nyou get a few weeks under your belt. \nYour only job next is to not break the \nchain.”\nThis chain method  (as some now \ncall it) soon became a hit among writers \nand fitness enthusiasts— communities \nthat thrive on the ability to do hard things \nconsistently. For our purposes, it\n\nprovides a specific example of a general \napproach to integrating depth into your \nlife: the rhythmic philosophy.  This \nphilosophy argues that the easiest way to \nconsistently start deep work sessions is \nto transform them into a simple regular \nhabit. The goal, in other words, is to \ngenerate a rhythm  for this work that \nremoves the need for you to invest \nenergy in deciding if and when you’re \ngoing to go deep. The chain method is a \ngood example of the rhythmic \nphilosophy of deep work scheduling \nbecause it combines a simple scheduling \nheuristic (do the work every day), with \nan easy way to remind yourself to do the \nwork: the big red Xs on the calendar.\n\nAnother common way to implement \nthe rhythmic philosophy is to replace the \nvisual aid of the chain method with a set \nstarting time that you use every day for \ndeep work. In much the same way that \nmaintaining visual indicators of your \nwork progress can reduce the barrier to \nentry for going deep, eliminating even \nthe simplest scheduling decisions, such \nas when during the day to do the work, \nalso reduces this barrier.\nConsider the example of Brian \nChappell, the busy doctoral candidate I \nintroduced in the opening to this strategy. \nChappell adopted the rhythmic \nphilosophy of deep work scheduling out \nof necessity. Around the time that he was\n\nramping up his dissertation writing he \nwas offered a full-time job at a center on \nthe campus where he was a student. \nProfessionally, this was a good \nopportunity and Chappell was happy to \naccept it. But academically, a full-time \njob, especially when coupled with the \nrecent arrival of Chappell’s first child, \nmade it difficult to find the depth needed \nto write thesis chapters.\nChappell began by attempting a \nvague commitment to deep work. He \nmade a rule that deep work needed to \nhappen in ninety-minute chunks \n(recognizing correctly that it takes time \nto ease into a state of concentration) and \nhe decided he would try to schedule\n\nthese chunks in an ad hoc manner \nwhenever appropriate openings in his \nschedule arose. Not surprisingly, this \nstrategy didn’t yield much productivity. \nIn a dissertation boot camp Chappell had \nattended the year before, he’d managed \nto produce a full thesis chapter in a \nsingle week of rigorous deep work. \nAfter he accepted his full-time job, he \nmanaged to produce only a single \nadditional chapter in the entire first  \nyear  he was working.\nIt was the glacial writing progress \nduring this year that drove Chappell to \nembrace the rhythmic method. He made \na rule that he would wake up and start \nworking by five thirty every morning. He\n\nwould then work until seven thirty, make \nbreakfast, and go to work already done \nwith his dissertation obligations for the \nday. Pleased by early progress, he soon \npushed his wake-up time to four forty- \nfive to squeeze out even more morning \ndepth.\nWhen I interviewed Chappell for this \nbook, he described his rhythmic \napproach to deep work scheduling as \n“both astronomically productive and \nguilt free.” His routine was producing \nfour to five pages of academic prose per \nday and was capable of generating draf ts \nof thesis chapters at a rate of one chapter \nevery two or three weeks :  a phenomenal \noutput for someone who also worked a\n\nnine-to-five job. “Who’s to say that I \ncan’t be that prolific?” he concluded. \n“Why not me?”\nThe rhythmic philosophy provides an \ninteresting contrast to the bimodal \nphilosophy. It perhaps fails to achieve \nthe most intense levels of deep thinking \nsought in the daylong concentration \nsessions favored by the bimodalist. The \ntrade-off, however, is that this approach \nworks better with the reality of human \nnature. By supporting deep work with \nrock-solid routines that make sure a little \nbit gets done on a regular basis, the \nrhythmic scheduler will often log a \nlarger total number of deep hours per \nyear.\n\nThe decision between rhythmic and \nbimodal can come down to your self­\ncontrol in",

If \nyou’re Carl Jung and are engaged in an \nintellectual dogfight with Sigmund \nFreud’s supporters, you’ll likely have no \ntrouble recognizing the importance of \nfinding time to focus on your ideas. On \nthe other hand, if you’re writing a \ndissertation with no one pressuring you \nto get it done, the habitual nature of the \nrhythmic philosophy might be necessary \nto maintain progress.\nFor many, however, it’s not just self­\ncontrol issues that bias them toward the \nrhythmic philosophy, but also the reality \nthat some jobs don’t allow you to\n\ndisappear for days at a time when the \nneed to go deep arises. (For a lot of \nbosses, the standard is that you’re free to \nfocus as hard as you want... so long as \nthe boss’s e-mails are still answered \npromptly.) This is likely the biggest \nreason why the rhythmic philosophy is \none of the most common among deep \nworkers in standard office jobs.\nThe Journalistic Philosophy  \nof Deep Work Scheduling\nIn the 1980s, the journalist Walter \nIsaacson was in his thirties and well \nalong in his rapid ascent through the\n\nranks of Time  magazine. By this point, he \nwas undoubtedly on the radar of the \nthinking class. Christopher Hitchens, for \nexample, writing in the London Review  \no f Books  during this period, called him \n“one of the best magazine journalists in \nAmerica.” The time was right for \nIsaacson to write a Big Important Book \n—a necessary step on the ladder of \njournalistic achievement. So Isaacson \nchose a complicated topic, an \nintertwined narrative biography of six \nfigures who played an important role in \nearly Cold War policy, and teamed up \nwith a fellow young Time  editor, Evan \nThomas, to produce an appropriately \nweighty book: an 864-page epic titled\n\nThe Wise Men: Six Friends and the  \nWorld They Made.\nThis book, which was published in \n1986, was well received by the right \npeople. The New York Times  called it “a \nrichly textured account,” while the San \nFrancisco Chronicle  exulted that the \ntwo young writers had “fashioned a \nCold War Plutarch.” Less than a decade \nlater, Isaacson reached the apex of his \njournalism career when he was \nappointed editor of Time  (which he then \nfollowed with a second act as the CEO \nof a think tank and an incredibly popular \nbiographer of figures including \nBenjamin Franklin, Albert Einstein, and \nSteve Jobs).\n\nWhat interests me about Isaacson, \nhowever, is not what  he accomplished \nwith his first book but how he wrote it. \nIn uncovering this story, I must draw \nfrom a fortunate personal connection. As \nit turns out, in the years leading up to the \npublication of The Wise Men,  my uncle \nJohn Paul Newport, who was also a \njournalist in New York at the time, \nshared a summer beach rental with \nIsaacson. To this day, my uncle \nremembers Isaacson’s impressive work \nhabits:\nIt was always amazing... he  \ncould retreat up to the bedroom  \nfo r a while, when the rest o f us\n\nwere chilling on the patio or  \nwhatever, to work on his book...  \nhe ’ d go up fo r twenty minutes or  \nan hour, we ’ d hear the  \ntypewriter pounding, then h e ’ d  \ncome down as relaxed as the rest  \no f us ... the work never seemed to  \nfaze him, he just happily went up  \nto work when he had the spare  \ntime.\nIsaacson was methodic: Any time he \ncould find some free time, he would \nswitch into a deep work mode and \nhammer away at his book. This is how, it \nturns out, one can write a nine-hundred- \npage book on the side while spending\n\nthe bulk of one’s day becoming one of \nthe country’s best magazine writers.\nI call this approach, in which you fit \ndeep work wherever you can into your \nschedule, the journalist philosophy.  \nThis name is a nod to the fact that \njournalists, like Walter Isaacson, are \ntrained to shift into a writing mode on a \nmoment’s notice, as is required by the \ndeadline-driven nature of their \nprofession.\nThis approach is not for the deep \nwork novice. As I established in the \nopening to this rule, the ability to rapidly \nswitch your mind from shallow to deep",

Without \npractice, such switches can seriously\n\ndeplete your finite willpower reserves. \nThis habit also requires a sense of \nconfidence in your abilities— a \nconviction that what you’re doing is \nimportant and will succeed. This type of \nconviction is typically built on a \nfoundation of existing professional \naccomplishment. Isaacson, for example, \nlikely had an easier time switching to \nwriting mode than, say, a first-time \nnovelist, because Isaacson had worked \nhimself up to become a respected writer \nby this point. He knew  he had the \ncapacity to write an epic biography and \nunderstood it to be a key task in his \nprofessional advancement. This \nconfidence goes a long way in\n\nmotivating hard efforts.\nI’m partial to the journalistic \nphilosophy of deep work because it’s my \nmain approach to integrating these \nefforts into my schedule. In other words, \nI’m not monastic in my deep work \n(though I do find myself occasionally \njealous of my fellow computer scientist \nDonald Knuth’s unapologetic \ndisconnection), I don’t deploy multiday \ndepth binges like the bimodalists, and \nthough I am intrigued by the rhythmic \nphilosophy, my schedule has a way of \nthwarting attempts to enforce a daily \nhabit. Instead, in an ode to Isaacson, I \nface each week as it arrives and do my \nbest to squeeze out as much depth as\n\npossible. To write this book, for \nexample, I had to take advantage of free \nstretches of time wherever they popped \nup. If my kids were taking a good nap, \nI’d grab my laptop and lock myself in the \nhome office. If my wife wanted to visit \nher parents in nearby Annapolis on a \nweekend day, I’d take advantage of the \nextra child care to disappear to a quiet \ncorner of their house to write. If a \nmeeting at work was canceled, or an \nafternoon left open, I might retreat to one \nof my favorite libraries on campus to \nsqueeze out a few hundred more words. \nAnd so on.\nI should admit that I’m not pure in my \napplication of the journalist philosophy.\n\nI don’t, for example, make all my deep \nwork decisions on a moment-to-moment \nbasis. I instead tend to map out when I’ll \nwork deeply during each week at the \nbeginning of the week, and then refine \nthese decisions, as needed, at the \nbeginning of each day (see Rule #4 for \nmore details on my scheduling routines). \nBy reducing the need to make decisions \nabout deep work moment by moment, I \ncan preserve more mental energy for the \ndeep thinking itself.\nIn the final accounting, the \njournalistic philosophy of deep work \nscheduling remains difficult to pull off. \nBut if you’re confident in the value of \nwhat you’re trying to produce, and\n\npracticed in the skill of going deep (a \nskill we will continue to develop in the \nstrategies that follow), it can be a \nsurprisingly robust way to squeeze out \nlarge amounts of depth from an \notherwise demanding schedule.\nRitualize\nAn often-overlooked observation about \nthose who use their minds to create \nvaluable things is that they’re rarely \nhaphazard in their work habits. Consider \nthe Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer \nRobert Caro. As revealed in a 2009 \nmagazine profile, “every inch of\n\n[Caro’s] New York office is governed \nby rules.” Where he places his books, \nhow he stacks his notebooks, what he \nputs on his wall, even what he wears to \nthe office: Everything is specified by a \nroutine that has varied little over Caro’s \nlong career. “I trained myself to be \norganized,” he explained.\nCharles Darwin had a similarly strict \nstructure for his working life during the \nperiod when he was perfecting On the  \nOrigin o f Species.  As his son Francis \nlater remembered, he would rise \npromptly at seven to take a short walk. \nHe would then eat breakfast alone and \nretire to his study from eight to nine \nthirty. The next hour was dedicated to\n\nreading his letters from the day before, \nafter which he would return to his study \nfrom ten thirty until noon. After this \nsession, he would mull over challenging \nideas while walking on a proscribed \nroute that started at his greenhouse and \nthen circled a path on his property. He \nwould walk until satisfied with his \nthinking then",

Their rituals minimized the friction \nin this transition to depth, allowing them \nto go deep more easily and stay in the \nstate longer. If they had instead waited\n\nfor inspiration to strike before settling in \nto serious work, their accomplishments \nwould likely have been greatly reduced.\nThere’s no one correct  deep work \nritual—the right fit depends on both the \nperson and the type of project pursued. \nBut there are some general questions that \nany effective ritual must address:\n• Where you’ll work and for how  \nlong .  Your ritual needs to specify a \nlocation for your deep work efforts. This \nlocation can be as simple as your normal \noffice with the door shut and desk \ncleaned off (a colleague of mine likes to \nput a hotel-style “do not disturb” sign on \nhis office door when he’s tackling\n\nsomething difficult). If it’s possible to \nidentify a location used only for depth— \nfor instance, a conference room or quiet \nlibrary—the positive effect can be even \ngreater. (If you work in an open office \nplan, this need to find a deep work \nretreat becomes particularly important.) \nRegardless of where you work, be sure \nto also give yourself a specific time \nframe to keep the session a discrete \nchallenge and not an open-ended slog.\n• How you’ll work once you start  \nto work .  Your ritual needs rules and \nprocesses to keep your efforts \nstructured. For example, you might\n\ninstitute a ban on any Internet use, or \nmaintain a metric such as words \nproduced per twenty-minute interval to \nkeep your concentration honed. Without \nthis structure, you’ll have to mentally \nlitigate again and again what you should \nand should not be doing during these \nsessions and keep trying to assess \nwhether you’re working sufficiently \nhard. These are unnecessary drains on \nyour willpower reserves.\n• How you’ll support your work .\nYour ritual needs to ensure your brain \ngets the support it needs to keep \noperating at a high level of depth. For\n\nexample, the ritual might specify that you \nstart with a cup of good coffee, or make \nsure you have access to enough food of \nthe right type to maintain energy, or \nintegrate light exercise such as walking \nto help keep the mind clear. (As \nNietzsche said: “It is only ideas gained \nfrom walking that have any worth.”) \nThis support might also include \nenvironmental factors, such as \norganizing the raw materials of your \nwork to minimize energy-dissipating \nfriction (as we saw with Caro’s \nexample). To maximize your success, \nyou need to support your efforts to go \ndeep. At the same time, this support\n\nneeds to be systematized so that you \ndon’t waste mental energy figuring out \nwhat you need in the moment.\nThese questions will help you get \nstarted in crafing your deep work ritual. \nBut keep in mind that finding a ritual that \nsticks might require experimentation, so \nbe willing to work at it. I assure you that \nthe effort’s worth it: Once you’ve \nevolved something that feels right, the \nimpact can be significant",

To work \ndeeply is a big deal and should not be an \nactivity undertaken lightly. Surrounding \nsuch efforts with a complicated (and \nperhaps, to the outside world, quite \nstrange) ritual accepts this reality—\n\nproviding your mind with the structure \nand commitment it needs to slip into the \nstate of focus where you can begin to \ncreate things that matter.\nMake Grand Gestures\nIn the early winter of 2007, J.K. \nRowling was struggling to complete The \nDeathly Hallows , the final book in her \nHarry Potter series. The pressure was \nintense, as this book bore the\nresponsibility of tying together the six \nthat preceded it in a way that would \nsatisfy the series’  hundreds of millions \nof fans. Rowling needed to work deeply\n\nto satisfy these demands, but she was \nfinding unbroken concentration \nincreasingly difficult to achieve at her \nhome office in Edinburgh, Scotland. “As \nI was finishing Deathly Hallows  there \ncame a day where the window cleaner \ncame, the kids were at home, the dogs \nwere barking,” Rowling recalled in an \ninterview. It was too much, so J.K. \nRowling decided to do something \nextreme to shift her mind-set where it \nneeded to be: She checked into a suite in \nthe five-star Balmoral Hotel, located in \nthe heart of downtown Edinburgh. “So I \ncame to this hotel because it’s a \nbeautiful hotel, but I didn’t intend to stay \nhere,” she explained. “[But] the first\n\nday’s writing went well so I kept coming \nback... and I ended up finishing the last \nof the Harry Potter  books [here].”\nIn retrospect, it’s not surprising that \nRowling ended up staying. The setting \nwas perfect for her project. The \nBalmoral, known as one of Scotland’s \nmost luxurious hotels, is a classic \nVictorian building complete with ornate \nstonework and a tall clock tower. It’s \nalso located only a couple of blocks \naway from Edinburgh Castle—one of \nRowling’s inspirations in dreaming up \nHogwarts.\nRowling’s decision to check into a \nluxurious hotel suite near Edinburgh \nCastle is an example of a curious but\n\neffective strategy in the world of deep \nwork: the grand gesture.  The concept is \nsimple: By leveraging a radical change \nto your normal environment, coupled \nperhaps with a significant investment of \neffort or money, all dedicated toward \nsupporting a deep work task, you \nincrease the perceived importance of the \ntask. This boost in importance reduces \nyour mind’s instinct to procrastinate and \ndelivers an injection of motivation and \nenergy.\nWriting a chapter of a Harry Potter \nnovel, for example, is hard work and \nwill require a lot of mental energy— \nregardless of where you do it. But when \npaying more than $1,000 a day to write\n\nthe chapter in a suite of an old hotel \ndown the street from a Hogwarts-style \ncastle, mustering  the energy to begin and \nsustain this work is easier than if you \nwere instead in a distracting home \noffice.\nWhen you study the habits of other \nwell-known deep workers, the grand \ngesture strategy comes up often. Bill \nGates, for example, was famous during \nhis time as Microsoft CEO for taking \nThink Weeks during which he would \nleave behind his normal work and family \nobligations to retreat to a cabin with a \nstack of papers and books. His goal was \nto think deeply, without distraction, \nabout the big issues relevant to his\n\ncompany. It was during one of these \nweeks, for example, that he famously \ncame to the conclusion that the Internet \nwas going to be a major force in the \nindustry. There was nothing physically \nstopping Gates from thinking deeply in \nhis office in Microsoft’s Seattle \nheadquarters, but the novelty of his \nweeklong retreat helped him achieve the \ndesired levels of concentration.\nThe MIT physicist and award­\nwinning novelist Alan Lightman also \nleverages grand gestures. In his case, he \nretreats each summer to a “tiny island” \nin Maine to think deeply and recharge. \nAt least as of 2000, when he described \nthis gesture in an interview, the island\n\nnot only lacked Internet, but didn’t even \nhave phone service. As he then justified: \n“It’s really about two and a half months \nthat I’ll feel like I can recover some \nsilence in my life... which is so hard to \nfind.”\nNot everyone has",

He eventually \nrealized that thirty thousand feet was an \nideal environment for him to focus. As \nhe explained in a blog post, “Locked in a \nseat with nothing in front of me, nothing \nto distract me, nothing to set off my \n‘Ooh! Shiny!’  DNA, I have nothing to do \nbut be at one with my thoughts.” It was \nsometime after this realization that \nShankman signed a book contract that \ngave him only two weeks to finish the \nentire manuscript. Meeting this deadline \nwould require incredible concentration. \nTo achieve this state, Shankman did\n\nsomething unconventional. He booked a \nround-trip business-class ticket to \nTokyo. He wrote during the whole flight \nto Japan, drank an espresso in the \nbusiness class lounge once he arrived in \nJapan, then turned around and flew back, \nonce again writing the whole way— \narriving back in the States only thirty \nhours after he first left with a completed \nmanuscript now in hand. “The trip cost \n$4,000 and was worth every penny,” he \nexplained.\nIn all of these examples, it’s not just \nthe change of environment or seeking of \nquiet that enables more depth. The \ndominant force is the psychology of \ncommitting so seriously to the task at\n\nhand. To put yourself in an exotic \nlocation to focus on a writing project, or \nto take a week off from work just to \nthink, or to lock yourself in a hotel room \nuntil you complete an important \ninvention: These gestures push your \ndeep goal to a level of mental priority \nthat helps unlock the needed mental \nresources. Sometimes to go deep, you \nmust first go big.\nDon’t Work Alone\nThe relationship between deep work and \ncollaboration is tricky. It’s worth taking \nthe time to untangle, however, because\n\nproperly leveraging collaboration can \nincrease the quality of deep work in your \nprofessional life.\nIt’s helpful to start our discussion of \nthis topic by taking a step back to \nconsider what at first seems to be an \nunresolvable conflict. In Part 1  of this \nbook I criticized Facebook for the \ndesign of its new headquarters. In \nparticular, I noted that the company’s \ngoal to create the world’s largest open \noffice space— a giant room that will \nreportedly hold twenty-eight hundred \nworkers—represents an absurd attack on \nconcentration. Both intuition and a \ngrowing body of research underscore the \nreality that sharing a workspace with a\n\nlarge number of coworkers is incredibly \ndistracting—creating an environment \nthat thwarts attempts to think seriously. \nIn a 201",

To support this \nclaim, let’s consider the origins of this \nparticular understanding of what spurs \nbreakthroughs.\nThe theory in question has many \nsources, but I happen to have a personal \nconnection to one of the more well- \nknown. During my seven years at MIT, I \nworked on the site of the institute’s \nfamed Building 20. This structure, \nlocated at the intersection of Main and \nVassar Streets in East Cambridge, and \neventually demolished in 1998, was\n\nthrown together as a temporary shelter \nduring World War II, meant to house the \noverflow from the school’s bustling \nRadiation Laboratory. As noted by a \n2012 New Yorker  article, the building \nwas initially seen as a failure: \n“Ventilation was poor and hallways \nwere dim The walls were thin, the roof \nleaked, and the building was broiling in \nthe summer and freezing in the winter.” \nWhen the war ended, however, the \ninflux of scientists to Cambridge \ncontinued. MIT needed space, so instead \nof immediately demolishing Building 20 \nas they had promised local officials (in \nexchange for lax permitting), they \ncontinued using it as overflow space.\n\nThe result was that a mismatch of \ndifferent departments—from nuclear \nscience to linguistics to electronics— \nshared the low-slung building alongside \nmore esoteric tenants such as a machine \nshop and a piano repair facility. Because \nthe building was cheaply constructed, \nthese groups felt free to rearrange space \nas needed. Walls and floors could be \nshif ted and equipment bolted to the \nbeams. In recounting the story of Jerrold \nZacharias’s work on the first atomic \nclock, the abovementioned New Yorker  \narticle points to the importance of his \nability to remove two floors from his \nBuilding 20 lab so he could install the \nthree-story cylinder needed for his\n\nexperimental apparatus.\nIn MIT lore, it’s generally believed \nthat this haphazard combination of \ndifferent disciplines, thrown together in \na large reconfigurable building, led to \nchance encounters and a spirit of \ninventiveness that generated \nbreakthroughs at a fast pace, innovating \ntopics as diverse as Chomsky grammars, \nLoran navigational radars, and video \ngames, all within the same productive \npostwar decades. When the building was \nfinally demolished to make way for the \n$300 million Frank Gehry-designed \nStata Center (where I spent my time), its \nloss was",

As Maria \nKonnikova reports in The New Yorker , \nwhen this concept first emerged, its goal \nwas to “facilitate communication and \nidea flow.” This claim resonated with \nAmerican businesses looking to embrace \nan aura of start-up unconventionality. \nJosh Tyrangiel, the editor of Bloomberg\n\nBusinessweek , for example, explained \nthe lack of offices in Bloomberg’s \nheadquarters as follows: “Open plan is \npretty spectacular; it ensures that \neveryone is attuned to the broad mission, \nand... it encourages curiosity between \npeople who work in different \ndisciplines.” Jack Dorsey justified the \nopen layout of the Square headquarters \nby explaining: “We encourage people to \nstay out in",

The \ntransistor, we can argue with some \nconfidence, probably required Bell Labs \nand its ability to put solid-state \nphysicists, quantum theorists, and world- \nclass experimentalists in one building \nwhere they could serendipitously \nencounter one another and learn from \ntheir varied expertise. This was an \ninvention unlikely to come from a lone \nscientist thinking deeply in the academic \nequivalent of Carl Jung’s stone tower.\nBut it’s here that we must embrace \nmore nuance in understanding what \nreally  generated innovation in sites such \nas Building 20 and Bell Labs. To do so, \nlet’s return once again to my own\n\nexperience at MIT. When I arrived as a \nnew PhD student in the fall of 2004, I \nwas a member of the first incoming class \nto be housed in the new Stata Center, \nwhich, as mentioned, replaced Building \n20. Because the center was new, \nincoming students were given tours that \ntouted its features. Frank Gehry, we \nlearned, arranged the offices around \ncommon spaces and introduced open \nstairwells between adjacent floors, all \nin an effort to support the type of \nserendipitous encounters that had \ndefined its predecessor. But what struck \nme at the time was a feature that hadn’t \noccurred to Gehry but had been recently \nadded at the faculty’s insistence: special\n\ngaskets installed into the office \ndoorjambs to improve soundproofing. \nThe professors at MIT— some of the \nmost innovative technologists in the \nworld—wanted nothing to do with an \nopen-office-style workspace. They \ninstead demanded the ability to close \nthemselves off.\nThis combination of soundproofed \noffices connected to large common areas \nyields a hub-and-spoke  architecture of \ninnovation in which both serendipitous \nencounter and isolated deep thinking are \nsupported. It’s a setup that straddles a \nspectrum where on one extreme we find \nthe solo thinker, isolated from \ninspiration but free from distraction, and\n\non the other extreme, we find the fully \ncollaborative thinker in an open office, \nflush with inspiration but struggling to \nsupport the deep thinking needed to \nbuild on i t -\nIf we turn our attention back to \nBuilding 20 and Bell Labs, we see that \nthis is the architecture they deployed as \nwell. Neither building offered anything \nresembling a modern open office plan. \nThey were instead constructed using the \nstandard layout of private offices \nconnected to shared hallways.

In tribute to the \n“plywood palace” it replaced, the\n\ninterior design of the Stata Center \nincludes boards of unfinished plywood \nand exposed concrete with construction \nmarkings left intact.\nAround the same time that Building \n20 was hastily constructed, a more \nsystematic pursuit of serendipitous \ncreativity was under way two hundred \nmiles to the southwest in Murray Hill, \nNew Jersey. It was here that Bell Labs \ndirector Mervin Kelly guided the \nconstruction of a new home for the lab \nthat would purposefully encourage \ninteraction between its diverse mix of \nscientists and engineers. Kelly \ndismissed the standard university-style \napproach of housing different\n\ndepartments in different buildings, and \ninstead connected the spaces into one \ncontiguous structure joined by long \nhallways— some so long that when you \nstood at one end it would appear to \nconverge to a vanishing point.

What makes this \nparticular innovation process an \ninteresting case, however, is that even \nwhen it shifted to a spoke it remained \ncollaborative. It was two researchers in \nparticular—the experimentalist Walter \nBrattain and the quantum theorist John \nBardeen—who over a period of one \nmonth in 1947 made the series of \nbreakthroughs that led to the first \nworking solid-state transistor.\nBrattain and Bardeen worked \ntogether during this period in a small \nlab, often side by side, pushing each \nother toward better and more effective \ndesigns. These efforts consisted\n\nprimarily of deep work—but a type of \ndeep work we haven’t yet encountered. \nBrattain would concentrate intensely to \nengineer an experimental design that \ncould exploit Bardeen’s latest \ntheoretical insight; then Bardeen would \nconcentrate intensely to make sense of \nwhat Brattain’s latest experiments \nrevealed, trying to expand his theoretical \nframework to match the observations. \nThis back-and-forth represents a \ncollaborative form of deep work \n(common in academic circles) that \nleverages what I call the whiteboard  \neffect.  For some types of problems, \nworking with someone else at the \nproverbial shared whiteboard can push\n\nyou deeper than if you were working \nalone. The presence of the other party \nwaiting for your next insight—be it \nsomeone physically in the same room or \ncollaborating with you virtually—can \nshort-circuit the natural instinct to avoid \ndepth.\nWe can now step back and draw \nsome practical conclusions about the \nrole of collaboration in deep work. The \nsuccess of Building 20 and Bell Labs \nindicates that isolation is not required \nfor productive deep work. Indeed, their \nexample indicates that for many types of \nwork—especially when pursuing\ninnovation—collaborative deep work \ncan yield better results. This strategy,\n\ntherefore, asks that you consider this \noption in contemplating how best to \nintegrate depth into your professional \nlife. In doing so, however, keep the \nfollowing two guidelines in mind.\nFirst,  distraction remains a destroyer \nof depth. Therefore, the hub-and-spoke \nmodel provides a crucial template. \nSeparate your pursuit of serendipitous \nencounters from your efforts to think \ndeeply and build on these inspirations. \nYou should try to optimize each effort \nseparately, as opposed to mixing them \ntogether into a sludge that impedes both \ngoals.\nSecond,  even when you retreat to a \nspoke to think deeply, when it’s\n\nreasonable to leverage the whiteboard \neffect, do so. By working side by side \nwith someone on a problem, you can \npush each other toward deeper levels of \ndepth, and therefore toward the \ngeneration of more and more valuable \noutput as compared to working alone.\nWhen it comes to deep work, in other \nwords, consider the use of collaboration \nwhen appropriate, as it can push your \nresults to a new level. At the same time, \ndon’t lionize this quest for interaction \nand positive randomness to the point \nwhere it crowds out the unbroken \n",

In the mid-1990s, \nHarvard Business School professor \nClayton Christensen received a call from \nAndy Grove, the CEO and chairman of \nIntel. Grove had encountered \nChristensen’s research on disruptive \ninnovation and asked him to fly out to \nCalifornia to discuss the theory’s \nimplications for Intel. On arrival, \nChristensen walked through the basics of \ndisruption: entrenched companies are \noften unexpectedly dethroned by start­\nups that begin with cheap offerings at the \nlow end of the market, but then, over\n\ntime, improve their cheap products just \nenough  to begin to steal high-end market \nshare. Grove recognized that Intel faced \nthis threat from low-end processors \nproduced by upstart companies like \nAMD and Cyrix. Fueled by his \nnewfound understanding of disruption, \nGrove devised the strategy that led to the \nCeleron family of processors— a lower- \nperformance offering that helped Intel \nsuccessfully fight off the challenges from \nbelow.\nThere is, however, a lesser-known \npiece to this story. As Christensen \nrecalls, Grove asked him during a break \nin this meeting, “How do I do this?” \nChristensen responded with a discussion\n\nof business strategy, explaining how \nGrove could set up a new business unit \nand so on Grove cut him off with a gruff \nreply: “You are such a naive academic. I \nasked you how to do it, and you told me \nwhat  I should do. I  know what I  need to  \ndo. Iju st don’ t know how to do it.”\nAs Christensen later explained, this \ndivision between what  and how is \ncrucial but is overlooked in the \nprofessional world. It’s often \nstraightforward to identify a strategy \nneeded to achieve a goal, but what trips \nup companies is figuring out how to \nexecute the strategy once identified. I \ncame across this story in a foreword \nChristensen wrote for a book titled The\n\n4 Disciplines o f Execution , which built \non extensive consulting case studies to \ndescribe four “disciplines” \n(abbreviated, 4DX) for helping \ncompanies successfully implement high- \nlevel strategies. What struck me as I \nread was that this gap between what  and \nhow was relevant to my personal quest \nto spend more time working deeply. Just \nas Andy Grove had identified the \nimportance of competing in the low-end \nprocessor market, I had identified the \nimportance of prioritizing depth. What I \nneeded was help figuring out how to \nexecute this strategy.\nIntrigued by these parallels, I set out \nto adapt the 4DX framework to my\n\npersonal work habits and ended up \nsurprised by how helpful they proved in \ndriving me toward effective action on \nmy goal of working deeply. These ideas \nmay have been forged for the world of \nbig business, but the underlying concepts \nseem to apply anywhere that something \nimportant needs to get done against the \nbackdrop of many competing obligations \nand distractions. With this in mind, Fve \nsummarized in the following sections the \nfour disciplines of the 4DX framework, \nand for each I describe how I adapted it \nto the specific concerns of developing a \ndeep work habit.\nDiscipline #1: Focus on the\n\nWildly Important\nAs the authors of The 4 Disciplines oj  \nExecution  explain, “The more you try to \ndo, the less you actually accomplish.” \nThey elaborate that execution should be \naimed at a small number of “wildly \nimportant goals.” This simplicity will \nhelp focus an organization’s energy to a \nsufficient intensity to ignite real results.\nFor an individual focused on deep \nwork, the implication is that you should \nidentify a small number of ambitious \noutcomes to pursue with your deep work \nhours. The general exhortation to “spend \nmore time working deeply” doesn’t \nspark a lot of enthusiasm To instead\n\nhave a specific goal that would return \ntangible and substantial professional \nbenefits will generate a steadier stream \nof enthusiasm In a 2014 column titled \n“The Art of Focus,” David Brooks \nendorsed this approach of letting \nambitious goals drive focused behavior, \nexplaining: “If you want to win the war \nfor attention, don’t try to say ‘no’  to the \ntrivial distractions you",

This \ngoal was ambitious, as it was more \npapers than I had been publishing, and \nthere were tangible rewards attached to \nit (tenure review was looming). \nCombined, these two properties helped \nthe goal stoke my motivation.\nDiscipline #2: Act on the Lead  \nMeasures\nOnce you’ve identified a wildly \nimportant goal, you need to measure \nyour success. In 4DX, there are two \ntypes of metrics for this purpose: lag\n\nmeasures and lead  measures. Lag \nmeasures describe the thing you’re \nultimately trying to improve. For \nexample, if your goal is to increase \ncustomer satisfaction in your bakery, \nthen the relevant lag measure is your \ncustomer satisfaction scores. As the \n4DX authors explain, the problem with \nlag measures is that they come too late to \nchange your behavior: “When you\nreceive them, the performance that drove \nthem is already in the past.”\nLead measures, on the other hand, \n“measure the new behaviors that will \ndrive success on the lag measures.” In \nthe bakery example, a good lead \nmeasure might be the number of\n\ncustomers who receive free samples. \nThis is a number you can directly \nincrease by giving out more samples. As \nyou increase this number, your lag \nmeasures will likely eventually improve \nas well. In other words, lead measures \nturn your attention to improving the \nbehaviors you directly control in the \nnear future that will then have a positive \nimpact on your long-term goals.\nFor an individual focused on deep \nwork, it’s easy to identify the relevant \nlead measure: time spent in a state oj  \ndeep work dedicated toward your  \nwildly important goal.  Returning to my \nexample, this insight had an important \nimpact on how I directed my academic\n\nresearch. I used to focus on lag \nmeasures, such as papers published per \nyear. These measures, however, lacked \ninfluence on my day-to-day behavior \nbecause there was nothing I could do in \nthe short term that could immediately \ngenerate a noticeable change to this \nlong-term metric. When I shifted to \ntracking deep work hours, suddenly \nthese measures became relevant to my \nday-to-day: Every hour extra of deep \nwork was immediately reflected in my \ntally.\nDiscipline #3: Keep a  \nCompelling Scoreboard\n\n“People play differently when they’re \nkeeping score,” the 4DX authors \nexplain They then elaborate that when \nattempting to drive your team’s \nengagement toward your organization’s \nwildly important goal, it’s important that \nthey have a public place to record and \ntrack their lead measures. This \nscoreboard creates a sense of \ncompetition that drives them to focus on \nthese measures, even when other \ndemands vie for their attention. It also \nprovides a reinforcing source of \nmotivation. Once the team notices their \nsuccess with a lead measure, they \nbecome invested in perpetuating this \nperformance.\n\nIn the preceding discipline, I argued \nthat for an individual focused on deep \nwork, hours spent working deeply \nshould be the lead measure. It follows, \ntherefore, that the individual’s \nscoreboard should be a physical artifact \nin the workspace that displays the \nindividual’s current deep work hour \ncount.\nIn my early experiments with 4DX, I \nsettled on a simple but effective solution \nfor implementing this scoreboard. I took \na piece of card stock and divided it into \nrows, one for each week of the current \nsemester. I then labeled each row with \nthe dates of the week and taped it to the \nwall next to my computer monitor\n\n(where it couldn’t be ignored). As each \nweek progressed, I kept track of the \nhours spent in deep work that week with \na simple tally of tick marks in that \nweek’s row. To maximize the motivation \ngenerated by this scoreboard, whenever \nI reached an important milestone in an \nacademic paper (e.g., solving a key \nproof), I would circle the tally mark \ncorresponding to the hour where I\nfinished the result- This served two \npurposes. First, it allowed me to \nconnect, at a visceral level, accumulated \ndeep work hours and tangible results. \nSecond, it helped calibrate",

In other words, lead measures \nturn your attention to improving the \nbehaviors you directly control in the \nnear future that will then have a positive \nimpact on your long-term goals.\nFor an individual focused on deep \nwork, it’s easy to identify",

It’s no surprise, therefore, that \nthese same disciplines can have a \nsimilar effect on your personal goal of \ncultivating a deep work habit.\nTo conclude, let’s return one last time \nto my own example. As I noted earlier, \nwhen I first embraced 4DXI adopted the \ngoal of publishing five peer-reviewed \npapers in the 2013-2014 academic year. \nThis was an ambitious goal given that I \nhad published only four papers the \nprevious year (a feat I was proud of). \nThroughout this 4DX experiment, the \nclarity of this goal, coupled with the \nsimple but unavoidable feedback of my\n\nlead measure scoreboard, pushed me to \na level of depth I hadn’t before \nachieved. In retrospect, it was not so \nmuch the intensity of my deep work \nperiods that increased, but instead their \nregularity. Whereas I used to cluster my \ndeep thinking near paper submission \ndeadlines, the 4DX habit kept my mind \nconcentrated throughout the full year. It \nended up, I must admit, an exhausting \nyear (especially given that I was writing \nthis book at the same time). But it also \nturned out to produce a convincing \nendorsement for the 4DX framework: By \nthe summer of 2014, I had nine full \npapers accepted for publication, more \nthan doubling what I had managed to\n\naccomplish in any preceding year.\nBe Lazy\nIn a 2012 article written for a New York  \nTimes  blog, the essayist and cartoonist \nTim Kreider provided a memorable self­\ndescription: “I am not busy. I am the \nlaziest ambitious person I know.” \nKreider’s distaste for frenetic work, \nhowever, was put to the test in the \nmonths leading up to the writing of his \npost. Here’s his description of the \nperiod: “I’ve insidiously started,\nbecause of professional obligations, to \nbecome busy... every morning my in­\n\nbox was full of e-mails asking me to do \nthings I did not want to do or presenting \nme with problems that I now had to \nsolve.”\nHis solution? He fled to what he \ncalls an “undisclosed location”:  a place \nwith no TV and no Internet (going online \nrequires a bike ride to the local library), \nand where he could remain \nnonresponsive to the pinprick onslaught \nof small obligations that seem harmless \nin isolation but aggregate to serious \ninjury to his deep work habit. “Fve \nremembered about butterc",

For the most part, the \nmore time you can spend immersed in \nshallow work the more of it that gets \naccomplished. As a writer and artist, \nhowever, Kreider is instead concerned \nwith deep work—the serious efforts that \nproduce things the world values. These \nefforts, he’s convinced, need the support \nof a mind regularly released to leisure.\nThis strategy argues that you should \nfollow Kreider’s lead by injecting\n\nregular and substantial freedom from \nprofessional concerns into your day, \nproviding you with the idleness \nparadoxically required to get (deep) \nwork done. There are many ways to \naccomplish this goal. You could, for \nexample, use Kreider’s approach of \nretreating from the world of shallow \ntasks altogether by hiding out in an \n“undisclosed location,” but this isn’t \npractical for most people. Instead, I \nwant to suggest a more applicable but \nstill quite powerful heuristic: At the end \nof the workday, shut down your \nconsideration of work issues until the \nnext morning—no after-dinner e-mail \ncheck, no mental replays of\n\nconversations, and no scheming about \nhow you’ll handle an upcoming \nchallenge; shut down work thinking \ncompletely. If you need more time, then \nextend your workday, but once you shut \ndown, your mind must be left free to \nencounter Kreider’s buttercups, stink \nbugs, and stars.\nBefore describing some tactics that \nsupport this strategy, I want to first \nexplore why a shutdown will be \nprofitable to your ability to produce \nvaluable output. We have, of course, Tim \nKreider’s personal endorsement, but it’s \nworth taking the time to also understand \nthe science behind the value of \ndowntime. A closer examination of this\n\nliterature reveals the following three \npossible explanations for this value.\nReason #1: Downtime Aids  \nInsights\nConsider the following excerpt from a \n2006 paper that appeared in the journal \nScience :\nThe scientific literature has  \nemphasized the benefits o f  \nconscious deliberation in  \ndecision making fo r hundreds o f  \nyears... The question addressed  \nhere is whether this view is\n\njustified. We hypothesize that it  \nis not.\nLurking in this bland statement is a \nbold claim The authors of this study, led \nby the Dutch psychologist Ap \nDijksterhuis, set out to prove that some \ndecisions are better left to your \nunconscious mind to untangle. In other \nwords, to actively try to work through \nthese decisions will lead to a worse  \noutcome than loading up the relevant \ninformation and then moving on to \nsomething else while letting the \nsubconscious layers of your mind mull \nthings over.\nDijksterhuis’s team isolated this\n\neffect by giving subjects the information \nneeded for a complex decision regarding \na car purchase. Half the subjects were \ntold to think through the information and \nthen make the best decision The other \nhalf were distracted by easy puzzles \nafter they read the information, and were \nthen put on the spot to make a decision \nwithout having had time to consciously \ndeliberate. The distracted group ended \nup performing better.\nObservations from experiments such \nas this one led Dijksterhuis and his \ncollaborators to introduce unconscious \nthought theory (UTT)— an attempt to \nunderstand the different roles conscious \nand unconscious deliberation play in\n\ndecision making. At a high level, this \ntheory proposes that for decisions",

Subjects \nwere split into two groups. One group \nwas asked to take a walk on a wooded\n\npath in an arboretum near the Ann Arbor, \nMichigan, campus where the study was \nconducted. The other group was sent on \na walk through the bustling center of the \ncity. Both groups were then given a \nconcentration-sapping task called \nbackward digit-span. The core finding of \nthe study is that the nature group \nperformed up to 20 percent better on the \ntask. The nature advantage still held the \nnext week when the researchers brought \nback the same subjects and switched the \nlocations: It wasn’t the people who \ndetermined performance, but whether or \nnot they got a chance to prepare by \nwalking through the woods.\nThis study, it turns out, is one of\n\nmany that validate attention restoration \ntheory (ART), which claims that \nspending time in nature can improve \nyour ability to concentrate. This theory, \nwhich was first proposed in the 1980s \nby the University of Michigan \npsychologists Rachel Kaplan and \nStephen Kaplan (the latter of which co­\nauthored the 2008 study discussed here, \nalong with Marc Berman and John \nJonides), is based on the concept of \nattention fatigue. To concentrate requires \nwhat ART calls directed attention.  This \nresource is finite: If you exhaust it, \nyou’ll struggle to concentrate. (For our \npurposes, we can think of this resource \nas the same thing as Baumeister’s\n\nlimited willpower reserves we \ndiscussed in the introduction to this \nrule.-) The 2008 study argues that \nwalking on busy city streets requires you \nto use directed attention, as you must \nnavigate complicated tasks like figuring \nout when to cross a street to not get run \nover, or when to maneuver around the \nslow group of tourists blocking the \nsidewalk. After just fifty minutes of this \nfocused navigation, the subject’s store of \ndirected attention was low.\nWalking through nature, by contrast, \nexposes you to what lead author Marc \nBerman calls “inherently fascinating \nstimuli,” using sunsets as an example. \nThese stimuli “invoke attention\n\nmodestly, allowing focused-attention \nmechanisms a chance to replenish.” Put \nanother way, when walking through \nnature, you’re freed from having to \ndirect your attention, as there are few \nchallenges to navigate (like crowded \nstreet crossings), and experience enough \ninteresting stimuli to keep your mind \nsufficiently occupied to avoid the need \nto actively aim your attention This state \nallows your directed attention resources \ntime to replenish After fifty minutes of \nsuch replenishment, the subjects enjoyed \na boost in their concentration\n(You might, of course, argue that \nperhaps being outside watching a sunset \nputs people in a good mood, and being\n\nin a good mood is what really helps \nperformance on these tasks. But in a \nsadistic twist, the researchers debunked \nthat hypothesis by repeating the \nexperiment",

As you might recall from Part 1, \ndeliberate practice is the systematic \nstretching of your ability for a given \nskill. It is the activity required to get \nbetter at something. Deep work and \ndeliberate practice, as Eve argued, \noverlap substantially. For our purposes \nhere we can use deliberate practice as a\n\ngeneral-purpose stand-in for cognitively \ndemanding efforts.\nIn Ericsson’s seminal 1993 paper on \nthe topic, titled “The Role of Deliberate \nPractice in the Acquisition of Expert \nPerformance,” he dedicates a section to \nreviewing what the research literature \nreveals about an individual’s capacity \nfor cognitively demanding work. \nEricsson notes that for a novice, \nsomewhere around an hour a day of \nintense concentration seems to be a \nlimit, while for experts this number can \nexpand to as many as four hours—but \nrarely more.\nOne of the studies cited, for example, \ncatalogs the practice habits of a group of\n\nelite violin players training at Berlin’s \nUniversitat der Kiinste. This study found \nthe elite players average around three \nand a half hours per day in a state of \ndeliberate practice, usually separated \ninto two distinct periods. The less \naccomplished players spent less time in \na state of depth.\nThe implication of these results is \nthat your capacity for deep work in a \ngiven day is limited. If you’re careful \nabout your schedule (using, for example, \nthe type of productivity strategies \ndescribed in Rule #4), you should hit \nyour daily deep work capacity during \nyour workday. It follows, therefore, that \nby evening, you’re beyond the point\n\nwhere you can continue to effectively \nwork deeply. Any work you do fit into \nthe night, therefore, won’t be the type of \nhigh-value activities that really advance \nyour career; your efforts will instead \nlikely be confined to low-value shallow \ntasks (executed at a slow, low-energy \npace). By deferring evening work, in \nother words, you’re not missing out on \nmuch of importance.\nThe three reasons just described support \nthe general strategy of maintaining a \nstrict endpoint to your workday. Let’s \nconclude by filling in some details \nconcerning implementation.\nTo succeed with this strategy, you\n\nmust first accept the commitment that \nonce your workday shuts down, you \ncannot allow even the smallest incursion \nof professional concerns into your field \nof attention.

This study found \nthe elite players average around three \nand a half hours per day in a state of \ndeliberate practice, usually separated \ninto two distinct periods.

The first thing I do is take a final \nlook at my e-mail inbox to ensure that \nthere’s nothing requiring an urgent \nresponse before the day ends. The next \nthing I do is transfer any new tasks that\n\nare on my mind or were scribbled down \nearlier in the day into my official task \nlists. (I use Google Docs for storing my \ntask lists, as I like the ability to access \nthem from any computer—but the \ntechnology here isn’t really relevant.) \nOnce I have these task lists open, I \nquickly skim every  task in every list, and \nthen look at the next few days on my \ncalendar. These two actions ensure that \nthere’s nothing urgent I’m forgetting or \nany important deadlines or appointments \nsneaking up on me. I have, at this point, \nreviewed everything that’s on my \nprofessional plate. To end the ritual, I \nuse this information to make a rough plan \nfor the next day. Once the plan is\n\ncreated, I say, “Shutdown complete,” \nand my work thoughts are done for the \nday.\nThe concept of a shutdown ritual \nmight at first seem extreme, but there’s a \ngood reason for it: the Zeigarnik effect. \nThis effect, which is named for the \nexperimental work of the early- \ntwentieth-century psychologist Bluma \nZeigarnik, describes the ability of \nincomplete tasks to dominate our \nattention. It tells us that if you simply \nstop whatever you are doing at five p.m \nand declare, “I’m done with work until \ntomorrow,” you’ll likely struggle to keep \nyour mind clear of professional issues, \nas the many obligations left unresolved\n\nin your mind will, as in Blurna \nZeigarnik’s experiments, keep battling \nfor your attention throughout the evening \n(a battle that they’ll often win).\nAt first, this challenge might seem \nunresolvable. As any busy knowledge \nworker can attest, there are always  tasks \nleft incomplete. The idea that you can \never reach a point where all your \nobligations are handled is a fantasy. \nFortunately, we don’t need to complete  a \ntask to get it off our minds. Riding to our \nrescue in this matter is our friend from \nearlier in the rule, the psychologist Roy \nBaumeister, who wrote a paper with E. J. \nMasicampo playfully titled “Consider It \nDone!” In this study, the two researchers\n\nbegan by replicating the Zeigarnik effect \nin their subjects (in this case, the \nresearchers assigned a task and then \ncruelly engineered interruptions), but \nthen found that they could significantly \nreduce the effect’s impact by asking the \nsubjects, soon after the interruption, to \nmake a plan for how they would later  \ncomplete the incomplete task.
