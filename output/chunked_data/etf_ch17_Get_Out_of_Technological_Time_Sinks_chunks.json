There are very few\nthings that are so important that they cannot wait.\nPeople often ask me at my seminars, “But don’t you have to keep\ncurrent with the news, by reading newspapers, listening to radio and\nwatching television?”\nI tell them, “If it is really important, someone will tell you.” If\nsomething important happens in your life, the country or the world,\nsomeone else can spend hours following the news for you, and they\nwill usually tell you on the first possible occasion.\nMany people discontinue newspapers, stop watching broadcast news\non television and refuse to listen to the radio. And surprisingly\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 103enough, they remain well informed on most important subjects.\nSomeone always keeps them up to date. You should do the same.\nEat That Frog!\n1.  Resolve today to create “zones of silence” during your day-to-day\nactivities. Turn off all communications devices and technology for\none hour in the morning and one hour in the afternoon. You will be\namazed at what happens: nothing!\n2.  Resolve to take one full day off each week during which you do\nnot touch your computer, check your Blackberry or make any\nattempt to keep in touch with the world of technology. At the end of\na day without continuous contact, except by voice, your mind will go\ncalm and clear, like water.
