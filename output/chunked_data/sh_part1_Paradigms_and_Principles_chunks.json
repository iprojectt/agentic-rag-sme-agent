But it's cost me \nmy personal and family life.  I don't know my wife  and children anymore.  I'm not even sure I know \nmyself and what's really important to me.  I've had to ask myself -- is it worth it? \n   I've started a new diet -- for the fifth time this year.  I know I' m overweight, and I really want to \nchange.  I read all the new information, I set goals, I get myself all psyched up with a positive mental \nattitude and tell myself I can do it.  But I don't.  Af ter a few weeks, I fizzle.  I just can't seem to keep a \npromise I make to myself.    I've taken course after course on effective mana gement training.  I expect a lot out of my employees \nand I work hard to be friendly tow ard them and to treat them right.  But I don't feel any loyalty from \nthem.  I think if I were home sick for a day, they 'd spend most of their ti me gabbing at the water \nfountain.  Why can't I train them to be independen t and responsible -- or find employees who can be? \n   My teenage son is rebellious and on drugs.  No matter what I try, he won't listen to me.  What can \nI do?    There's so much to do.  And there's never enough  time.  I feel pressured and hassled all day, every \nday, seven days a week.  I've attended time manageme nt seminars and I've tried half a dozen different \nplanning systems.  They've helped some, but I still don't feel I'm living the happy, productive, peaceful \nlife I want to live.    I want to teach my children the value of work.  But to get them to do anything, I have to supervise \nevery move;  and put up with complaining every step of the way.  It's so much easier to do it myself.  \nWhy can't children do their work ch eerfully and without being reminded? \n   I'm busy -- really busy.  But sometimes I wonder  if what I'm doing will make a difference in the \nlong run.  I'd really like to think there was mean ing in my life, that some how things were different \nbecause I was here.    I see my friends or relatives achieve some degree  of success or receive some  recognition, and I smile \nand congratulate them enthusiastically.  But inside, I' m eating my heart out.  Why do I feel this way? \n   I have a forceful personality.  I know, in almost  any interaction, I can control the outcome.  Most of \nthe time, I can even do it by influencing others to come up with the solution I want.  I think through \neach situation and I really feel the ideas I come up with are usually the best for everyone.  But I feel \nuneasy.  I always wonder what other peop le really think of me and my ideas. \n    My marriage has gone flat.  We don't fight or anything; we just don't lo ve each other anymore.  \nWe've gone to counseling; we've tried a number of th ings, but we just can't seem to rekindle the feeling \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \nwe used to have. \n   These are deep problems",

Socially he was immature, often \nembarrassing those closest to him.  Athletically, he  was small, skinny, and uncoordinated -- swinging \nhis baseball bat, for example, almost before the ba ll was even pitched.  Others would laugh at him. \n    Sandra and I were consumed with a desire to help him.  We felt th at if \"success\" were important in \nany area of life, it was supremely im portant in our role as parents.  So we worked on our attitudes and \nbehavior toward him and we tried to work on his.  We attempted to psyche him up using positive \nmental attitude techniques.  \"Come on, son! You can do it! We know you can.  Put your hands a little \nhigher on the bat and keep your eye on the ball.  Don' t swing till it gets close to you.\" And if he did a \nlittle better, we would go to great lengths to rein force him.  \"That's good, son, keep it up.\" \n   When others laughed, we reprimanded them.  \"L eave him alone.  Get off his back.  He's just \nlearning.\" And our son would cry and insist that he'd never be any good and that he didn't like baseball \nanyway.    Nothing we did seemed to help, and we were rea lly worried.  We could see the effect this was \nhaving on his self-esteem.  We tried to be encou raging and helpful and positive, but after repeated \nfailure, we finally drew back and tried to lo ok at the situation on a different level. \n   At this time in my professional role I was in volved in leadership development work with various \nclients throughout the country.  In that capacity I was preparing bimonthly pr ograms on the subject of \ncommunication and perception for IBM's Ex ecutive Development Program participants. \n   As I researched and prepared these presentati ons, I became particul arly interested in how \nperceptions are formed, how they behave.  This led me to a study of expectancy theory and \nself-fulfilling prophecies or the \"Pygmalion effect,\"  and to a realization of how deeply imbedded our \nperceptions are.  It taught me that we must look at  the lens through which we see the world, as well as \nat the world we see, and that the lens it self shapes how we interpret the world. \n   As Sandra and I talked about the concepts I wa s teaching at IBM and ab out our own situation, we \nbegan to realize that what we were doing to help our son was not in harmony with the way we really \nsaw him.  When we honestly examined our deepest f eelings, we realized that our perception was that \nhe was basically inadequate, somehow \"behind.\" No matter how much we worked on our attitude and \nbehavior, our efforts were ineffective because, de spite our actions and our words, what we really \ncommunicated to him was, \"You aren't capable.  You have to be protected.\"    We began to realize that if we wanted to change  the situation, we first had to change ourselves.  \nAnd to change ourselves effectively, we first had to change our perceptions. \n The Personality and Character Ethics     At the same time, in addition to my research on perception, I was also deeply immersed in an \nin-depth study of the success literature published in  the United States sinc e 1776.  I was reading or \nscanning literally hundreds of books, articles, and es says in fields such as self-improvement, popular \npsychology, and self-help.  At my fingertips was the sum and substance of what a free and democratic \npeople considered to be the keys to successful living.     As my study took me back through 200 years of  writing about success, I noticed a startling pattern \nemerging in the content of the literature.  Because of our own pain, and because of similar pain I had \nseen in the lives and relationships of many people I had worked with through the years, I began to feel \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L",

It was filled \nwith social image consciousness, techniques and quic k fixes -- with social band-aids and aspirin that \naddressed acute problems and sometimes even appe ared to solve them temporarily -- but left the \nunderlying chronic problems untouched to  fester and resurface time and again. \n   In stark contrast, almost all the literature in th e first 150 years or so focused on what could be called \nthe character ethic as the foundation of success -- th ings like integrity, humility, fidelity, temperance, \ncourage, justice, patience, industry, simplicity, mo desty, and the Golden Rule.  Benjamin Franklin's \nautobiography is representative of that literature.  It is, basically, the story of one man's effort to \nintegrate certain principles and habits deep within his nature. \n   The character ethic taught that there are basic prin ciples of effective living, and that people can only \nexperience true success and enduring happiness as th ey learn and integrate thes e principles into their \nbasic character.    But shortly after World War I the basic view of success shifted from the ch aracter ethic to what we \nmight call the personality ethic.

We also conscientiously worked on our \nmotives and cultivated internal sources of secu rity so that our own feelings of worth were not \ndependent on our children's \"acceptable\" behavior.    As we loosened up our old perception of our son and developed value-based motives, new feelings \nbegan to emerge.  We found ourselves enjoying him instead of comparing or judging him.  We \nstopped trying to clone him in our own image or  measure him against social expectations.  We \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \nstopped trying to kindly, positively manipulate him into an acceptable social mold.  Because we saw \nhim as fundamentally adequate and able to cope with life, we stopped protecting him against the \nridicule of others.    He had been nurtured on this protection, so  he went through some withdrawal pains, which he \nexpressed and which we accepted, but did not necessar ily respond to.  \"We don't need to protect you,\" \nwas the unspoken message.  \"You're fundamentally okay.\"    As the weeks and months passed, he began to f eel a quiet confidence and affirmed himself.  He \nbegan to blossom, at his own pace and speed.  He be came outstanding as measured by standard social \ncriteria -- academically, socially and athletically -- at a rapid clip, far beyond the so-called natural \ndevelopmental process.  As the years passed, he was elected to several student body leadership \npositions, developed into an all-state athlete and st arted bringing home straight A report cards.  He \ndeveloped an engaging and guileless personality that has enabled him to relate in nonthreatening ways \nto all kinds of people.    Sandra and I believe that our son's \"soc ially impressive\" accomplishments were more a \nserendipitous expression of the fee lings he had about himself than mere ly a response to social reward.  \nThis was an amazing experience for Sandra and me, and a very instructional one in dealing with our \nother children and in other roles as  well.  It brought to our awareness on a very personal level the vital \ndifference between the personality et hic and the character ethic of succ ess.  The Psalmist expressed our \nconviction well: \"Search your own heart with all di ligence for out of it flow the issues of life.\" \n Primary and Secondary Greatness     M y  e x p e r i e n c e  w i t h  m y  s o n ,  m y  s t u d y  o f  p e rception and my reading of the success literature \ncoalesced to create one of those \"Aha!\" experiences in  life when suddenly things click into place.

My \nduplicity will breed distrust, and everything I do  -- even using so-called good human relations \ntechniques -- will be perceived as manipulative.  It  simply makes no difference how good the rhetoric \nis or even how good the intentions are; if there is little or no trust, there is no foundation for permanent \nsuccess.  Only basic goodness gives life to technique.    To focus on technique is like cramming your  way through school.  You sometimes get by, perhaps \neven get good grades, but if you don't pay the price day in and day out, you never achieve true mastery \nof the subjects you study or develop an educated mind.    Did you ever consider how ridiculous it would be to  try to cram on a farm -- to forget to plant in the \nspring, play all summer and then cram in the fall to br ing in the harvest? The f arm is a natural system.  \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \nThe price must be paid and the process followed.  You always reap what you sow; there is no shortcut. \n   This principle is also true, ultimately, in huma n behavior, in human relationships.  They, too, are \nnatural systems based on the The Law of the Harvest. In the short run, in an artifi cial social system such \nas school, you may be able to get by if you learn ho w to manipulate the man-made rules, to \"play the \ngame.\" In most one-shot or short-lived human intera ctions, you can use the personality ethic to get by \nand to make favorable impressions through charm an d skill and pretending to be interested in other \npeople's hobbies.  You can pick up quick, easy tech niques that may work in short-term situations.  \nBut secondary traits alone have no permanent worth in long-term relationships.  Eventually, if there \nisn't deep integrity and fundamental character strength , the challenges of life w ill cause true motives to \nsurface and human relationship failu re will replace short-term success. \n   Many people with secondary greatness -- that is , social recognition for their talents -- lack primary \ngreatness or goodness in their character.  Sooner or later, you'll see this in every long-term relationship \nthey have, whether it is with a business associate, a spouse, a friend, or a teenage child going through \nan identity crisis.  It is character that communicate s most eloquently.  As Em erson once put it, \"What \nyou are shouts so loudly in my ears that I cannot hear what you say.\"    There are, of course, situations where people have character strength but they lack communication \nskills, and that undoubtedly affects the quality of relationships as well.  But the effects are still \nsecondary.    In the last analysis, what we are communicate s far more eloquently than anything we say or do.  \nWe all know it.  There are people we trust abso lutely because we know their character.  Whether \nthey're eloquent or not, whether they have the human relations tec hniques or not, we trust them, and \nwe work successfully with them.    In the words of William George Jordan, \"Into th e hands of every individual is given a marvelous \npower for good or evil -- the silent unconscious, un seen influence of his life.  This is simply the \nconstant radiation of what man really  is, not what he pretends to be.\" \n The Power of a Paradigm     The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People em body many of the fundamental principles of human \neffectiveness.  These habits are basic; they are pr imary.  They represent the internalization of correct \nprinciples upon which enduring happiness and success are based. \n   But before we can really understand these Seven Habits TM, we need to understand our own \n\"paradigms\" and how to make a \"A Paradigm Shift TM.\"    Both the The Character Ethic The Personality Ethi c are examples of social paradigms.  The word \nparadigm comes from the Greek.  It was originally a scientific term, and is more commonly used today \nto mean a model, theory, perception, assumption, or fr ame of reference.  In the more general sense, it's \nthe way we \"see\" the world -- not in terms of our vi sual sense of sight, but in terms of perceiving, \nunderstanding, and interpreting.     For our purposes",

For our purposes, a simple way to understand para digms is to see them as maps.  We all know that \n\"the map is not the territory.\" A map is simply an e xplanation of certain aspects of the territory.  That's \nexactly what a paradigm is.  It is a theory, an explanation, or model of something else. \n   Suppose you wanted to arrive at a specific locati on in central Chicago.  A street map of the city \nwould be a great help to you in reaching your destination.  But suppose you were given the wrong \nmap.  Through a printing error, the map labeled \"Chicago\" was actually a map of Detroit.  Can you imagine the frustration, the ineffectivene ss of trying to reach your destination? \n   You might work on your behavior -- you could try harder, be more diligent, double your speed.  \nBut your efforts would only succeed in getting you to the wrong place faster. \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n \n   You might work on your attitude -- you could th ink more positively.  You still wouldn't get to the \nright place, but perhaps you wouldn't care.  Your  attitude would be so positive, you'd be happy \nwherever you were.    The point is, you'd still be lost.  The fundamental  problem has nothing to do with your behavior or \nyour attitude.  It has everything to do with having a wrong map. \n   If you have the right map of Chicago, then diligence becomes important, and when you encounter \nfrustrating obstacles along the way, then attitude ca n make a real difference.  But the first and most \nimportant requirement is the accuracy of the map.    Each of us has many, many maps in our head, which can be divided into two main categories: maps \nof the way things are, or realities, and maps of th e way things should be, or values.  We interpret \neverything we experience through these mental maps .  We seldom question  their accuracy; we're \nusually even unaware that we have them.  We simp ly assume that the way we see things is the way \nthey really are or the way they should be.    And our attitudes and behaviors grow out of those assumptions.  The way we see things is the \nsource of the way we think and the way we act.    Before going any further, I invite you to have an intellectual and emotional experience.  Take a few \nseconds and just look at the picture on the following page    Now look at the picture below and carefully describe what you see    Do you see a woman? How old would you say she is? What does she look like? What is she wearing? \nIn what kind of roles do you see her?    You probably would describe the woman in the second picture to be about 25 years old -- very \nlovely, rather fashionable with a petite nose and demure presence.  If you were a single man you \nmight like to take her out.  If you were in retailing, you might hire her as a fashion model.    But what if I were to tell you that you're wrong? Wh at if I said this picture is of a woman in her 60s \nor 70s who looks sad, has a huge nose, and certainly is no model.  She's someone you probably would \nhelp cross the street.    Who's right? Look at the pict ure again.  Can you see the old woma n? If you can't, keep trying.  \nCan you see her big hook nose? Her shawl?    If you and I were talking face to face, we coul d discuss the picture.  You could describe what you \nsee to me, and I could talk to you about what I s ee.  We could continue to communicate until you \nclearly showed me what you see in the pict ure and I clearly showed you what I see. \n   Because we can't do that, turn to page 45 and st udy the picture there and th en look at this picture \nagain.  Can you see the old woman now? It's import ant that you see her before you continue reading. \n   I first encountered this exercise many years ag o at the Harvard Business School.  The instructor was \nusing it to demonstrate clearly and eloquently that two people can see the same thing, disagree,",

The instructor was \nusing it to demonstrate clearly and eloquently that two people can see the same thing, disagree, and yet \nboth be right.  It's not logical; it's psychological.     He brought into the room a stack of large card s, half of which had the image of the young woman \nyou saw on page 25, and the other half of which had the old woman on page 45. \n   He passed them out to the class, the picture of  the young woman to one side of the room and the \npicture of the old woman to the other.  He asked us to  look at the cards, conc entrate on them for about \n10 seconds and then pass them back in.  He then projected upon the screen the picture you saw on \npage 26 combining both images and asked the class to  describe what they saw.  Almost every person \nin that class who had first seen the young woma n's image on a card saw the young woman in the \npicture.  And almost every person in that class who had first seen the old woman's image on a card \nsaw an old woman in the picture.  \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n \n   The professor then asked one student to explain wh at he saw to a student on the opposite side of the \nroom.  As they talked back and fort h, communication problems flared up. \n   \"What do you mean, 'old lady'? She co uldn't be more than 20 or 22 years old! \n   \"Oh, come on.  You have to be joking.  She's 70 -- could be pushing 80!\"    \"What's the matter with you?  Are you blind?  Th is lady is young, good looking.  I'd like to take \nher out.  She's lovely.\"    \"Lovely? She's an old hag.    The arguments went back and forth, each person  sure of, and adamant in, his or her position.  All \nof this occurred in spite of one exceedingly import ant advantage the students had -- most of them knew \nearly in the demonstration that another point of view did, in fact, exist -- something many of us would \nnever admit.  Nevertheless, at first, only a few stud ents really tried to see this picture from another \nframe of reference.    After a period of futile communication, one st udent went up to the screen and pointed to a line on \nthe drawing.  \"There is the young woman's necklace.\"  The other one said, \"No, that is the old woman's \nmouth.\" Gradually, they began to calmly discuss specif ic points of difference, and finally one student, \nand then another, experienced sudden recognition when the images of bo th came into focus.  Through \ncontinued calm, respectful, and specific communication,  each of us in the room was finally able to see \nthe other point of view.  But when  we looked away and then back, mo st of us would immediately see \nthe image we had been conditioned to s ee in the 10-second period of time. \n   I frequently use this perception demonstration in working with people an d organizations because it \nyields so many deep insights into both personal and interpersonal effectiveness.  It shows, first of all, \nhow powerfully conditioning affects our perceptions, our paradigms.  If 10 seconds can have that kind \nof impact on the way we see things, what about the co nditioning of a lifetime?  The influences in our \nlives -- family, school, church, work environment, friends, associates, and current social paradigms such \nas the personality ethic -- all have made their silent  unconscious impact on us and help shape our frame \nof reference, our paradigms, our maps.    It also shows that these paradigms are the sour ce of our attitudes and behaviors.  We cannot act \nwith integrity outside of them.  We simply cannot maintain wholeness if we talk and walk differently \nthan we see.  If you were among the 90 percent who typically see the young woman in the composite \npicture when conditioned to do so, you undoubtedly fo und it difficult to think in terms of having to \nhelp her cross the street.  Both your attitude ab out her and your behavior toward her had to be \ncongruent with the way you saw her.    This brings into focus one of the basic flaws of  the personality ethic.",

To try to change outward \nattitudes and behaviors does very little good in th e long run if we fail to examine the basic paradigms \nfrom which those attitudes and behaviors flow.    This perception demonstration also shows ho w powerfully our paradigms affect the way we interact \nwith other people.  As clearly and objectively as we think we see things, we begin to realize that others \nsee them differently from their own apparently equa lly clear and objective point of view.  \"Where we \nstand depends on where we sit.\"    Each of us tends to think we see things as they are, that we are objective.  But this is not the case.  \nWe see the world, not as it is, but as we are -- or, as we are conditioned to see it.  When we open our \nmouths to describe what we see, we in effect desc ribe ourselves, our perceptions, our paradigms.  \nWhen other people disagree with us, we immediately th ink something is wrong with them.  But, as the \ndemonstration shows, sincere, clearheaded people see things differently, each looking through the \nunique lens of experience.    This does not mean that there are no facts.  In the demonstration, two individuals who initially \nhave been influenced by different conditioning pict ures look at the third pi cture together.

But each person's interp retation of these facts repr esents prior experiences, \nand the facts have no meaning whatso ever apart from the interpretation. \n   The more aware we are of our basic paradigms, ma ps, or assumptions, and the extent to which we \nhave been influenced by our experience, the mo re we can take responsib ility for those paradigms, \nexamine them, test them against reality, listen to others and be open to th eir perceptions, thereby \ngetting a larger picture and a far more objective view.  The Power of a Paradigm Shift     Perhaps the most important insight to be gained from the perception demonstration is in the area of \nparadigm shifting, what we might call the \"Aha!\" expe rience when someone finally \"sees\" the composite \npicture in another way.  The more bound a person is by the initial perception, the more powerful the \n\"Aha!\" experience is.  It's as though a light were suddenly turned on inside. \n   The term Paradigm Shift was introduced by Thom as Kuhn in his highly influential landmark book, \nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions.  Kuhn show s how almost every significant breakthrough in the \nfield of scientific endeavor is first a break with trad ition, with old ways of th inking, with old paradigms. \n   For Ptolemy, the great Egyptian astronomer, the earth was the center of the universe.  But \nCopernicus created a Paradigm Shift, and a great deal of resistance and persecution as well, by placing \nthe sun at the center.  Suddenly, everyth ing took on a different interpretation. \n   The Newtonian model of physics was a cloc kwork paradigm and is still the basis of modern \nengineering.  But it was partial, incomplete.  The scientific world was revolutionized by the \nEinsteinian paradigm, the relativity paradigm, whic h had much higher predictive and explanatory \nvalue.    Until the germ theory was de veloped, a high percentage of women and children died during \nchildbirth, and one could understand why.  In m ilitary skirmishes, more men were dying from small \nwounds and diseases than from the major traumas on the front lines.  But as soon as the germ theory \nwas developed, a whole new paradigm, a better, improved way of understanding what was happening made dramatic, significant medical improvement possible.    The United States today is the fruit of a Paradig m Shift.  The traditional concept of government for \ncenturies had been a monarchy, the divine right of kings.  Then a different paradigm was developed -- \ngovernment of the people, by the people, and for the people.  And a constitutional democracy was \nborn, unleashing tremendous human energy and inge nuity,",

As we have observed, the shift from the \ncharacter ethic to the personality ethic has drawn us aw ay from the very roots that nourish true success \nand happiness.    But whether they shift us in positive or nega tive directions, whether they are instantaneous or \ndevelopmental, Paradigm Shifts move us from one way of seeing the world to another.  And those \nshifts create powerful change.  Our paradigms, correct  or incorrect, are the sources of our attitudes and \nbehaviors, and ultimately our relationships with others.    I remember a mini-Paradigm Shift I experienced one Sunday morning on a subway in New York.  \nPeople were sitting quietly -- some reading newspapers, some lost in thought, some resting with their \neyes closed.  It was a calm, peaceful scene.    Then suddenly, a man and his children entered the subway car.  The children were so loud and \nrambunctious that instantly the whole climate changed. \n   The man sat down next to me and closed his eyes, apparently oblivious to the situation.  The \nchildren were yelling back and forth, throwing things , even grabbing people's papers.  It was very \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \ndisturbing.  And yet, the man sitting next to me did nothing. \n   It was difficult not to feel irritated.  I could not believe that he could be  so insensitive to let his \nchildren run wild like that and do no thing about it, taking no responsib ility at all.  It was easy to see \nthat everyone else on the subway felt irritated, too.   So finally, with what I felt was unusual patience \nand restraint, I turned to him and said, \"Sir, your children are really disturbi ng a lot of people.  I \nwonder if you couldn't control them a little more?\"    The man lifted his gaze as if to come to a con sciousness of the situation fo r the first time and said \nsoftly, \"Oh, you're right.  I guess I should do some thing about it.  We just came from the hospital \nwhere their mother died about an hour ago.  I don' t know what to think, an d I guess they don't know \nhow to handle it either.\"    Can you imagine what I felt at that mome nt? My paradigm shifted.  Suddenly I saw things \ndifferently, I felt differently, I behaved differently.  My irritation vanished.  I didn't have to worry \nabout controlling my attitude or my behavior; my he art was filled with the man's pain.  Feelings of \nsympathy and compassion flowed freely.  \"Your wi fe just died? Oh, I'm so sorry. Can you tell me \nabout it? What can I do to help?\" Everything changed in an instant. \n   Many people experience a similar fundamental sh ift in thinking when they  face a life-threatening \ncrisis and suddenly see their priorities in a different light, or when they sudden ly step into a new role, \nsuch as that of husband or wife, pare nt or grandparent, manager or leader. \n   We could spend weeks, months, even years labori ng with the personality ethic trying to change our \nattitudes and behaviors and not even begin to ap proach the phenomenon of change that occurs \nspontaneously when we see things differently.    It becomes obvious that if we want to make relatively minor changes in our lives, we can perhaps \nappropriately focus on our attitudes and behaviors.   But if we want to make significant, quantum \nchange, we need to work on our basic paradigms. \n   In the words of Thoreau, \"For every thousand hack ing at the leaves of evil, there is one striking at \nthe root.\" We can only achieve quantum improvements in our lives as we quit hacking at the leaves of \nattitude and behavior and get to work on the root, the paradigms from which our attitudes and \nbehaviors flow.  Seeing and Being     Of course, not all Paradigm Shifts are instantane ous.  Unlike my instant in sight on the subway, the \npar",

And those \nshifts create powerful change.  Our paradigms, correct  or incorrect, are the sources of our attitudes and \nbehaviors, and ultimately our relationships with others.    I remember a mini-Paradigm Shift I experienced one Sunday morning on a subway in New York.  \nPeople were sitting quietly -- some reading newspapers, some lost in thought, some resting with their \neyes closed.  It was a calm",

We can't go very far to change our seeing  without simultaneously changing our being, and \nvice versa.

The power \nof a Paradigm Shift is the essential power of quantum change, whether that shift is an instantaneous or \na slow and deliberate process.  The Principle-Centered Paradigm     The character ethic is based on the fundamental idea that there are principles that govern human \neffectiveness -- natural laws in the human dimension that are just as real, just as unchanging and \nunarguably \"there\" as laws such as gravity are in the physical dimension.    An idea of the reality -- and the impact -- of these principles can be captured in another \nparadigm-shifting experience as told by Frank Kock in Proceedi ngs, the magazine of the Naval \nInstitute.    Two battleships assigned to the training squadr on had been at sea on maneuvers in heavy weather \nfor several days.  I was serving on the lead battleshi p and was on watch on the bridge as night fell.  \nThe visibility was poor with patchy fog, so the capt ain remained on the bridge  keeping an eye on all \nactivities.    Shortly after dark, the lookout on the wing of the bridge reported, \"Light, bearing on the starboard \nbow.\"    \"Is it steady or moving astern?\" the captain called out.    Lookout replied, \"Steady, captain,\" which mean t we were on a dangerous collision course with that \nship.    The captain then called to the signal man, \"Signal that ship: We are on a collision course, advise you change course 20 degrees.\"    Back came a signal, \"Advisable for you to change course 20 degrees.\"    The captain said, \"Send, I'm a captain, change course 20 degrees.\"    \"I'm a seaman second class,\" came the reply.  \"You had better change course 20 degrees.\"    By that time, the captain was furious.  He spat  out, \"Send, I'm a battleship.  Change course 20 \ndegrees.\"    Back came the flashing  light, \"I'm a lighthouse.\" \n   We changed course    The A Paradigm Shift is the \"a-h a\" experience associated with fi nally perceiving or understanding \nsome aspect of the world (or a ci rcumstance) in a different way. Paradigm Shift experienced by the \ncaptain -- and by us as we read this account -- puts th e situation in a totally different light",

These princi ples surface time and time again, and the degree to \nwhich people in society recognize and live in harmon y with them moves them toward either survival \nand stability or disintegration and destruction.    The principles I am referring to are not esoteric , mysterious, or \"religious\" ideas.  There is not one \nprinciple taught in this book that is unique to any specific faith or religion, including my own.  These \nprinciples are a part of every major enduring relig ion, as well as enduring social philosophies and \nethical systems.  They are self-evident and can easily be validated by any individual.  It's almost as if \nthese principles or natural laws are part of the huma n condition, part of the human consciousness, part \nof the human conscience.  They seem to exist in a ll human beings, regardless of social conditioning and \nloyalty to them, even though they might be subm erged or numbed by conditions or disloyalty. \n   I am referring, for example, to the principle of  fairness, out of which our whole concept of equity \nand justice is developed.  Little children seem to have  an innate sense of the idea of fairness even apart \nfrom opposite conditioning experiences.  There are  vast differences in how fairness is defined and \nachieved, but there is almost universal awareness of the idea.    Other examples would include integrity and hones ty.  They create the foundation of trust which is \nessential to cooperation and long-ter m personal and interpersonal growth. \n   Another principle is human dignity.  The ba sic concept in the United States Declaration of \nIndependence bespeaks this value or principle.  \"We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men \nare created equal and endowed by their Creator with ce rtain inalienable rights, that among these are life, \nliberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\"    Another principle is service, or the idea of maki ng a contribution.  Another is quality or excellence. \n   There is the principle of potential, the idea  that we are embryonic and can grow and develop and \nrelease more and more potential, develop more and mo re talents.  Highly related to potential is the \nprinciple of growth -- the process of releasing potent ial and developing talents,  with the accompanying \nneed for principles such as patien ce, nurturance, and encouragement. \n   Principles are not practices.  A practice is a spec ific activity or action.  A practice that works in one \ncircumstance will not necessarily work in another, as  parents who have tried to raise a second child \nexactly like they did the first one can readily attest.    While practices are situationally specific, principl es are deep, fundamental tr uths that have universal \napplication.  They apply to individuals, to marriages , to families, to private an d public organizations of \nevery kind.  When these truths are internalized in to habits, they empower people to create",

Principles of Growth and Change     The glitter of the personality et hic, the massive appeal, is that th ere is some quick and easy way to \nachieve quality of life -- personal e ffectiveness and rich, deep relation ships with other people -- without \ngoing through the natural process of wo rk and growth that makes it possible \n   It's symbol without substance.  It's the \"get  rich quick\" scheme promising \"wealth without work.\" \nAnd it might even appear to succ eed -- but the schemer remains. \n   The personality ethic is illusory and deceptive.   And trying to get high-quality results with its \ntechniques and quick fixes is just about as effective as trying to get to some  place in Chicago using a \nmap of Detroit.    In the words of Erich Fromm, an astute observer  of the roots and fruits of the personality ethic. \n   Today we come across an individual who beha ves like an automaton, who does not know or \nunderstand himself, and the only person that he kn ows is the person that he is supposed to be, whose \nmeaningless chatter has replaced communicative sp eech, whose synthetic smile has replaced genuine \nlaughter, and whose sense of dull despair has taken th e place of genuine pain.  Two statements may be \nsaid concerning this individual.  One is that he suffers from defects of spontaneity and individuality \nwhich may seem to be incurable.  At  the same time it may be said of  him he does not differ essentially \nfrom the millions of the rest of us who walk upon this earth. \n   In all of life, there are sequential stages of gr owth and development.  A child learns to turn over, to \nsit up, to crawl, and then to walk and run.  Each step is important and each one takes time.  No step \ncan be skipped.    This is true in all phases of life, in all areas of development, whether it be learning to play the piano \nor communicate effectively with a working associate.  It is true with individuals, with marriages, with \nfamilies, and with organizations.    We know and accept this fact or principle of pr ocess in the area of physical things, but to understand \nit in emotional areas, in human relations, and even  in the area of personal character is less common and \nmore difficult.

It is simply impossibl e to violate, ignore, or shortcut this development \nprocess.  It is contrary to nature, and attempting to  seek such a shortcut only  results in disappointment \nand frustration.

You cannot pretend for long, for you will eventually be found \nout.  Admission of ignorance is often the first step  in our education.  Thoreau taught, \"How can we \nremember our ignorance, which ou r growth requires, when we are using our knowledge all of the \ntime?\"    I recall one occasion when two young women, daug hters of a friend of mine, came to me tearfully, \ncomplaining about their father's harshness and lack of understanding.  They were afraid to open up \nwith their parents for fear of the consequences.  An d yet they desperately needed their parents' love, \nunderstanding, and guidance.    I talked with the father and found that he was intellectually aware of what was happening.  But \nwhile he admitted he had a temper problem, he refused to take responsibility for it and to honestly accept the fact that his emotional development le vel was low.  It was more than his pride could \nswallow to take the first step toward change.    To relate effectively with a wife, a husband, ch ildren, friends, or working associates, we must learn \nto listen.  And this requires emotional strength.  Listening involves patience , openness, and the desire \nto understand -- highly developed qualities of charact er.  It's so much easier to operate from a low \nemotional level and to give high-level advice.    Our level of development is fairly obvious with  tennis or piano playing, where it is impossible to \npretend.  But it is not so obvious in the areas of  character and emotional development.  We can \"pose\" \nand \"put on\" for a stranger or an associate.  We can pretend.  And for a while we can get by with it -- \nat least in public.  We might even deceive ourselves.   Yet I believe that most of us know the truth of \nwhat we really are inside; and I think many of those we live with and work with do as well. \n   I have seen the consequences of attempting to shortcut this natural process of growth often in the \nbusiness world, where executives attempt to \"buy\" a new culture of improved productivity, quality, \nmorale, and customer service with the strong speeche s, smile training, and external interventions, or \nthrough mergers, acquisitions, and friendly or unfr iendly takeovers.  But they ignore the low-trust \nclimate produced by such manipulations.  When  these methods don't work, they look for other \npersonality ethic techniques that will -- all the time ignoring and vi olating the natural principles and \nprocesses on which high-trust culture is based.    I remember violating this principle myself as a father many years ago.  One day I returned home to \nmy little girl's third-year birthday party to find her in the corner of  the front room, defiantly clutching \nall",

One day I returned home to \nmy little girl's third-year birthday party to find her in the corner of  the front room, defiantly clutching \nall of her presents, unwilling to let the other childre n play with them.  The first thing I noticed was \nseveral parents in the room witnessi ng this selfish display.  I was embarrassed, and doubly so because \nat the time I was teaching university classes in human relations.  And I knew, or at least felt, the expectation of these parents.    The atmosphere in the room was really ch arged -- the children were crowding around my little \ndaughter with their hands out, asking to play with the presents they had just  given, and my daughter \nwas adamantly refusing.  I said to myself, \"Certainly  I should teach my daughter to share.  The value \nof sharing is one of the most  basic things we believe in.\" \n   So I first tried a simple request.  \"Honey, woul d you please share with your friends the toys they've \ngiven you?    \"No,\" she replied flatly.    My second method was to use a little reasoning.  \"Honey, if you learn to sh are your toys with them \nwhen they are at your home, then  when you go to their homes they  will share their toys with you.\" \n   Again, the immediate reply was \"No!\"    I was becoming a little more embarrassed, for it was evident I was having no influence.  The third \nmethod was bribery.  Very softly I said, \"Honey, if  you share, I've got special surprise for you.  I'll \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \ngive you a piece of gum.\" \n   \"I don't want gum!\" she exploded.    Now I was becoming exasperated.  For my fourth  attempt, I resorted to fear and threat.  \"Unless \nyou share, you will be in real trouble!\"    \"I don't care!\" she cried.  \"These are my things.  I don't have to share!\" \n   Finally, I resorted to force.  I merely took some of the toys and gave them to the other kids.  \"Here, \nkids, play with these.\"    But at that moment, I valued  the opinion those parents had of  me more than the growth and \ndevelopment of my child and our relationship togethe r.  I simply made an initial judgment that I was \nright; she should share, and she was wrong in not doing so. \n   Perhaps I superimposed a higher-level expectatio n on her simply because on my own scale I was at \na lower level.  I was unable or unwilling to give pati ence or understanding, so I expected her to give \nthings.  In an attempt to compensate for my defi ciency, I borrowed strength  f r o m  m y  p o s i t i o n  a n d  \nauthority and forced her to do what I wanted her to do.    But borrowing strength builds weakness.  It builds weakness in the borrower because it reinforces \ndependence on external factors to get things do ne.  It builds weakness in  the person forced to \nacquiesce, stunting the development of independent reasoning, growth , and internal discipline.  And \nfinally, it builds weakness in the relationship.  Fear replaces cooperation, and both people involved \nbecome more arbitrary and defensive.    And what happens when the source of borrowed stre ngth -- be it superior size or physical strength, \nposition, authority, credentials, status symbols, a ppearance, or past achievements -- changes or is no \nlonger there?    Had I been more mature, I could have relied on  my own intrinsic strength -- my understanding of \nsharing and of growth and my capacity to love and nurture -- and allowed my daughter to make a free \nchoice as to whether she wanted to share or not to share.  Perhaps after attempting to reason with her, \nI could have turned the attention of the children to  an interesting game, taking all that emotional \npressure off my child.  I've learned that once child ren gain a sense of real possession, they share very \nnaturally, freely, and spontaneously.    My experience has been that there are times to teach and times not to teach.  When relationships \nare strained and the air charged with emotion, an a ttempt to teach is often perceived as a form of \njudgment and rejection.  But",

Is getting more things done in less time going \nto make a difference -- or will it just increase the pace at which I react to the people and circumstances \nthat seem to control my life?

It says it is futile \nto put personality ahead of character, to try to im prove relationships with others before improving \nourselves.    Inside-Out is a process -- a continuing process of renewal based on the natural laws that govern \nhuman growth and progress.  It's an upward spiral of growth that leads to progressively higher forms \nof responsible independence an d effective interdependence. \n   I have had the opportunity to work with many people -- wonderful people, talented people, people \nwho deeply want to achieve happin ess and success, people who are searc h",

To recognize and develop them and to use them in meeting our deepest \nconcerns, we need to think differently, to shift our paradigms to a new, deeper, \"Inside-Out\" level. \n   As we sincerely seek to understand and integ rate these principles into our lives, I am convinced we \nwill discover and rediscover the truth of T. S. Eliot's observation:    We must not cease from exploration and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we \nbegan and to know the place for the first time.  \nThe Seven Habits -- An Overview \n    We are what we repeatedly do.  Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit. \n   -- Aristotl \n \n   Our character, basically, is a composite of our habits .  \"Sow a thought, reap an action; sow an action, \nreap a habit; sow a habit, reap a character; sow a character,",

Habits are powerful factors in our lives.  Beca use they are consistent, often unconscious patterns, \nthey constantly, daily, express our character and produce our effectiveness or ineffectiveness. \n   As Horace Mann, the great educator, once said, \"Habits are like a cable.  We weave a strand of it \neveryday and soon it cannot be broken .\" I personally do not agree with the last part of his expression.  \nI know they can be broken.  Habits can be learned an d unlearned.  But I also know it isn't a quick fix.  \nIt involves a process and a tremendous commitment.

They are also habits of effectiveness because they  are based on a paradigm of effectiveness that is in \nharmony with a natural law, a prin ciple I call the \"P/PC Balance,\" whic h many people break themselves \nagainst.  This principle can be easily understood  by remembering Aesop's fa ble of the Goose and the \nGolden Egg TM.    This fable is the story of a poor farmer who one day discovers in the nest of his pet goose a glittering \ngolden egg.  At first, he thinks it must be some ki nd of trick.  But as he starts to throw the egg aside, \nhe has second thoughts and takes it in to be appraised instead. \n   The egg is pure gold! The farmer can't belie ve his good fortune.  He becomes even more \nincredulous the following day when th e experience is repeated.  Day after day, he awakens to rush to \nthe nest and find another golden egg.  He becomes fa bulously wealthy; it all seems too good to be true. \n   But with his increasing wealth comes greed and impatience.  Unable to wait day after day for the \ngolden eggs, the farmer decides he will kill the goose and get them all at once.  But when he opens the \ngoose, he finds it empty.  There are no golden e ggs -- and now there is no way to get any more.  The \nfarmer has destroyed the goose that produced them.    But as the story shows, true effectiveness is a function of two things: what is produced (the golden \neggs) and the producing asset or capacity to produce (the goose).  \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n   If you adopt a pattern of life that focuses on go lden eggs and neglects the goose, you will soon be \nwithout the asset that produces golden eggs.  On th e other hand, if you only take care of the goose \nwith no aim toward the golden eggs, you soon won' t have the wherewithal to  feed yourself or the \ngoose.    Effectiveness lies in the balance -- what I call the P/PC Balance TM.  P stands for production of \ndesired results, the golden eggs.  PC stands for produc tion capability, the ability or asset that produces \nthe golden eggs.  Three Kinds of Assets     Basically, there are three kinds of assets: physical , financial, and human.  Let's look at each one in \nturn.    A few years ago, I purchased a physical asset -- a power lawn mower.  I used it over and over again \nwithout doing anything to maintain it.  The mower worked well for two seasons, but then it began to break down.  When I tried to revive it with serv ice and sharpening, I discovered the engine had lost \nover half its original power capacity.  It was essentially worthless.    Had I invested in PC -- in preserving and mainta ining the asset -- I would still be enjoying its P -- the \nmowed lawn.  As it was, I had to spend far more  time and money replacing the mower than I ever \nwould have spent, had I maintained it.  It simply wasn't effective. \n   In our quest for short-term re turns, or results, we often ruin a prized physical asset -- a car, a \ncomputer, a washer or dryer, even our body or ou r environment.  Keeping P and PC in balance makes \na tremendous difference in the e ffective use of physical assets. \n   It also powerfully impacts the effective use of  financial assets.  How often do people confuse \nprincipal with interest? Have you ever invaded princi pal to increase your standard of living, to get \nmore golden eggs? The decreasing principal has decr easing power to produce interest or income.  And \nthe dwindling capital becomes smaller and smaller un til it no longer supplies even our basic needs. \n   Our most important financial asset is our own ca pacity to earn.  If we don't continually invest in \nimproving our own PC, we severely limit our options.  We're locked  into our present situation, \nrunning scared of our corporation or  our boss's opinion of us, economic ally dependent and defensive.  \nAgain, it simply isn't effective.    In the human area, the P/PC Balance is equally",

Perhaps the compan y is in a rapid growth stage and promotions are \ncoming fast.  So he produces at optimum levels  -- no downtime, no maintenance.  He runs the \nmachine day and night.  The production is phen omenal, costs are down, and profits skyrocket.  \nWithin a short time, he's promoted.  Golden eggs.    But suppose you are his successor on the job.  You inherit a very sick goose, a machine that, by this \ntime, is rusted and starts to break down.  You have  to invest heavily in downtime and maintenance.  \nCosts skyrocket; profits nose-dive.  And who gets blamed for the loss of golden eggs? You do.  Your \npredecessor liquidated the asset, but the accounting system only reported unit  production, costs, and \nprofit.    The P/PC Balance is particularly important as it applies to the human assets  of an organization -- the \ncustomers and the employees.    I know of a restaurant that served a fantasti c clam chowder and was pack ed with customers every \nday at lunchtime.  Then the business was sold, and the new owner focused on golden eggs -- he \ndecided to water down the chowder.  For about a month, with costs down and revenues constant, \nprofits zoomed.  But little by little, the customers began to disappear.  Trust was gone, and business \ndwindled to almost nothing.  The new owner tried desperately to reclaim it, but he had neglected the \ncustomers, violated their trust, and lost the asset of customer loyalty.  There was no more goose to \nproduce the golden egg.    There are organizations that talk a lot about th e customer and then completely neglect the people \nthat deal with the customer -- the employees.  Th e PC principle is to always treat your employees \nexactly as you want them to treat your best customers.    You can buy a person's hand, but you can't buy his heart.  His heart is where his enthusiasm, his loyalty is.  You can buy his back, but you can't buy his brain.  That's where his creativity is, his \ningenuity, his resourcefulness.    PC work is treating employees as volunteers just as you treat customers as volunteers, because that's \nwhat they are.  They volunteer the best part -- their hearts and minds. \n   I was in a group once where someone asked,  \"How do you shape up  lazy",

You can see it when you press to get your ow n way with someone and somehow feel an emptiness \nin the relationship; or when you really take time to invest in a relationship and you find the desire and \nability to work together, to communicate, takes a quantum leap.
