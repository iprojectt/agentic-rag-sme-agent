Unless you were willing to hover over your\nemployees every minute of the day , or to manage all\ntransactions yourself , it was diﬀicult to prevent theft.\nAs Patterson mulled over his predicament, he came\nacross an advertisement for a new invention called Ritty’s\nIncorruptible Cashier . Designed by fellow Dayton resident\nJames Ritty , it was the ﬁrst cash register . The machine\nautomatically locked the cash and receipts inside after each\ntransaction. P atterson bought two for ﬁfty dollars each.\nEmployee theft at his store vanished overnight. In the\nnext six months, Patterson’s business went from losing\nmoney to making $5,000 in proﬁt—the equivalent of more\nthan $100,000 today .\nPatterson was so impressed with the machine that he\nchanged businesses. He bought the rights to Ritty’s\ninvention and opened the National Cash Register Company .\nTen years later , National Cash Register had over one\nthousand employees and was on its way to becoming one of\nthe most successful businesses of its time.\nThe best way to break a bad habit is to make it\nimpractical to do . Increase the friction until you don’t even\nhave the option to act. The brilliance of the cash register\nwas that it automated ethical behavior by making stealing\npractically impossible. R ather than trying to change the\nemployees, it made the preferred behavior automatic.\nSome actions—like installing a cash register—pay oﬀ\nagain and again.

    "text": " to pour into the next stage of\ngrowth. As mathematician and philosopher Alfred North\nWhitehead wrote, “ Civilization advances by extending the\nnumber of operations we can perform without thinking\nabout them.”\nOf course, the power of technology can work against us\nas well. Binge-watching becomes a habit because you have\nto put more eﬀort in to stop looking at the screen than to\ncontinue doing so . Instead of pressing a button to advance\nto the next episode, Netﬂix or Y ouTube will autoplay it for\nyou. All you have to do is keep your eyes open.\nTechnology creates a level of convenience that enables\nyou to act on your smallest whims and desires. A t the mere\nsuggestion of hunger , you can have food delivered to your\ndoor. At the slightest hint of boredom, you can get lost in\nthe vast expanse of social media. When the eﬀort required\nto act on your desires becomes eﬀectively zero, you can\nﬁnd yourself slipping into whatever impulse arises at the\nmoment. The downside of automation is that we can ﬁnd\nourselves jumping from easy task to easy task without\nmaking time for more diﬀicult, but ultimately more\nrewarding, work.\nI often ﬁnd myself gravitating toward social media\nduring any downtime. If I feel bored for just a fraction of a\nsecond, I reach for my phone. It’s easy to write oﬀ these\nminor distractions as “just taking a break,” but over time\nthey can accumulate into a serious issue. The constant tug\nof “just one more minute” can prevent me from doing\nanything of consequence. (I’m not the only one. The\naverage person spends over two hours per day on social\nmedia. What could you do with an extra six hundred hours\nper year?)\nDuring the year I was writing this book, I experimented\nwith a new time management strategy . Every Monday , my\nassistant would reset the passwords on all my social media\naccounts, which logged me out on each device. All week I\nworked without distraction. On Friday , she would send me\nthe new passwords. I had the entire weekend to enjoy what\nsocial media had to oﬀer until Monday morning when she\nwould do it again. (If you don’t have an assistant, team up\nwith a friend or family member and reset each other’s\npasswords each week.)\nOne of the biggest surprises was how quickly I adapted.\nWithin the ﬁrst week of locking myself out of social media, I\nrealized that I didn’t need to check it nearly as often as I\nhad been, and I certainly didn’t need it each day . It had\nsimply been so easy that it had become the default. Once\nmy bad habit became impossible, I discovered that I did\nactually have the motivation to work on more meaningful\ntasks. A fter I removed the mental candy from my\nenvironment, it became much easier to eat the healthy\nstuﬀ.\nWhen working in your favor , automation can make your\ngood habits inevitable and your bad habits impossible. It is\nthe ultimate way to lock in future behavior rather than\nrelying on willpower in the moment.
