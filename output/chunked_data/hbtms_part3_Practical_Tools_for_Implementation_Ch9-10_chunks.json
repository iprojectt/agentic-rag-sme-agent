    "text": ", R. Alec. The Time Trap, 2nd rev. ed., NY: ANACOM, American Management\nAssociation, 1990.\nHandbook on Time Management Skills\n23Based on the analysis of Activity Time Log over some period, it is possible for managers\nto calculate their daily efficiency ratio.  Daily efficiency ratio is the amount of time spent by\nmanagers on the work divided by the total amount of time they spent in the office.\nEfficiency Ratio = (Time Doing “Real Work”) / (Time Spent “At Work”)\nAssuming that managers have done only 15 hours of actual productive time in a week (60\nhrs), the Daily Efficiency Ratio of a manager is only 25% of the time.\nB. Goal-Setting\nWhy is goal-setting so important in time management? From the time management\nperspective, a person’s life is a sequence of big and small choices and decisions. It is\nthose choices that a person really manages, not the flow of time. A key difference between\nsuccessful and unsuccessful managers is the quality and practicality of the goals they setfor themselves. Goals state clearly the measurable and specific results to be accomplished\nby the managers and the timeframe to attain them.\nGoal-setting is the wisdom that comes from practical experience that helps managers\ndirect their conscious and subconscious decisions towards success. The process of setting\ngoals helps managers choose where they want to go in personal and professional life. Bybeing aware of precisely what they want to achieve, they know the efforts required for it.\nGoals help in monitoring the day to day activities and ensure the activities are progressing\nin the right direction. There are two types of goals managers can set for themselves –rational goals and directional goals. Rational goals are specific, short-time goals focusing\non the questions-\n• What do I want to accomplish?\n• Why am I doing this task?• Who are all involved in the task?\n• What are the expected outcomes of this task?\n• When can this task be expected to be completed?\nSoft Skills for Public Managers\n24Directional goals (also known as domain planning) are long-term goals with no predictable\noutcomes, focusing on the question - What do I want to accomplish? To stay focused,\nmanagers should aim and visualize these goals. They should identify possible quartersfrom where they can pool up the support and required resources needed to put together\nand accomplish those goals.\nTime Management Goal Planner\nLifetime Goals (long range)\n•        1.\n•        2.•        3.•        4.\nOne-year goals (medium range)\n•        1.•        2.•        3.•        4.\nOne-month goals (short range)\n•        1.•        2.•        3.•        4.\nPick two top priority goals from each category.

Gene Donohue (“Goal Setting\nPowerful Written Goals in 7 Easy Steps!”) lays down the following 7 goal setting steps for\nthe managers to follow that help in building the road map to good goals.\n•1. Make sure the goal you are working for is something you really want, not\njust something that sounds good : When setting goals it is very important for the\nmanagers to remember that the goals are compatible with their personal interests\nand values. Any inherent conflict or incompatibility will cause unwarranted friction\nand adversely impact accomplishment of the goals.\n•2. A goal cannot contradict any of your other goals:  Non-integrated thinking\ncan also sabotage all the hard work managers put into their goals. Non-integrated\nthinking can also hamper their everyday thoughts. Managers should continually striveto eliminate contradictory ideas from their thinking.\n•3. Develop goals in the 6 areas of life:  Setting goals in each area of life will\nensure a more balanced life as managers begin to examine and change the\nfundamentals of everyday living. Setting goals in each area of life also helps in\neliminating the non-integrated thinking. The six areas of life that need goal-settinginclude –\n•Family and Home              \n•Physical and Health\n•Mental and Educational\n•Financial and Career\n•Spiritual and Ethical",

Write down your goals:  The difference between a goal and a dream is the\nwritten word. Writing down the goals creates the roadmap to success. Although the\nmere act of writing them down can set the process in motion, it is also extremelyimportant to review the goals frequently. The more focused the managers are on\ntheir goals, the more likely they are to accomplish them.\n•5. Write your goal in the positive instead of the negative:  The subconscious\nmind can not determine right from wrong and it does not judge. It’s only function is\nto carry out its instructions. The more positive instructions one gives it, the more\npositive results one will get.\n•6. Write your goal out in complete detail.  Writing down goals in details is once\nagain giving the subconscious mind a detailed set of instructions to work on. Themore information one gives it, the more clear the final outcome becomes. The more\nprecise the outcome, the more efficient the subconscious mind can become.\n•7. By all means, make sure your goal is high enough:  Keeping in view the\ntime and resources at their disposal, managers should set fairly high but practicable\ngoals. Lower goals are indicators of lower motivational levels on the part of\nmanagers. Higher goals are pointers to the zest managers have toward their work.\nApart from the above, traditional goal-setting wisdom teaches that a good goal must be\nbelievable, specific and measurable, and have a deadline.\nManagers must believe that it is possible for them to achieve the goal or they will not be\nmotivated to try. The goals should also be measurable and specific enough for them to\nknow unambiguously whether they have been completed yet or not. For goals to bemeaningful, managers must know the time-frame by when they are to be accomplished.\nReviewing your goals daily is a crucial part of a manager’s success and must become\npart of his/her routine. At the beginning of each day, they must take stock of the list of goals\nand identify the efforts required on their part, for the day, to accomplish each of the goals\nby the set deadline. Each night, they should review the goals to ascertain whether the\nHandbook on Time Management Skills\n27required work has been done or not. This process will set their subconscious and conscious\nminds working towards the goal. This will also begin to replace any of the negative self-talk\nthey may indulge in and replace it with positive self-talk.\nA manager’s time can best be directed by using goals. Without goals, they become easily\nside-tracked and waste time.\nC. Defining Priorities\nPrioritizing means “taking conscious control of one’s choices and deciding to spend more\ntime on the activities and tasks that are important and valuable, and less time on the onesthat are not....” The importance of prioritizing tasks or activities is best driven home by the\npopular ‘pebbles and jar’ parable.\nOne day, an expert in time management was speaking to a group of managers. As he\nstood in front of the group of high-powered over-achievers he said, “Okay, time for a quiz”\nand he pulled out a one-gallon, wide-mouth mason jar and set it on the table in front of him.He also produced about a dozen fist-sized rocks and carefully placed them, one at a time,\ninto the jar. When the jar was filled to the top and no more rocks would fit inside, he asked,\n“Is this jar full?” Everyone yelled, “Yes.”\nThe time management expert replied, “Really?” He reached under the table and pulled out\na bucket of gravel. He dumped some gravel in and shook the jar causing pieces of gravel\nto work themselves down into the spaces between the big rocks. He then asked the grouponce more, “Is the jar full?”\n“Probably not,” one of them answered.\n“Good!” he replied. He reached under the table and brought out a bucket of sand. He\nstarted dumping the sand in the jar and it went into all of the spaces left between the rocks\nand the gravel. Once more he asked the question, “Is this jar full?”\n“No!” the audience shouted.\nSoft Skills for Public Managers\n28Once again he said, “Good.” Then he grabbed a pitcher of water and began to pour it in\nuntil the jar was filled to the brim. Then he looked at the spectators and asked, “What is the\npoint of this illustration?”\nOne eager beaver raised his hand and said, “The point is, no matter how full your schedule\nis, if you try really",

The president, one Charles Schwab, was interested to\nfind out how he could increase performance. Lee was telling Schwab how he could\nprovide him with advice to better manage the company. Schwab, however, was notinterested because he did not want more knowledge. Instead, he wanted to find out how\nto get more done within available time, and he was willing to pay anything within reason\nfor such advice. Lee said that he could help him increase his efficiency by at least 50%provided he could have about 20 minutes of his time.\nAfter Schwab consented, Lee gave him a blank piece of paper and told him to write\ndown the six most important things he wanted to accomplish tomorrow. Schwab thoughtabout it and completed the task in about three minutes. Then Lee instructed him to order\nthese things from most important to least important. That, too, took very little time. Now\nHandbook on Time Management Skills\n29the executive was instructed to keep the list until the following morning, at which time he\nwas asked to look at the first item and to start working on it until it was completed. After\nthat he was told to work on task number two and so on until the end of the day. Lee furtheradvised Schwab not to worry about those tasks that he could not get done, since it didn’t\nmatter because they would not have gotten done anyway.\nThen Schwab was asked to repeat this process every working day. Lee then told him to\ntry this system as long as he likes. Lee also asked Schwab to have his employees try\nthis system and, if it worked, to send him a check for whatever the idea was worth to him\nand the company. After several months, Lee received a check for $25,000 and a letter inwhich Schwab said that this was one of the most profitable ideas that he had ever been\ntaught. It is further reputed that the consistent application of this strategy helped to turn\nthis small steel mill into Bethlehem Steel.\nManagers must realize that they cannot simply do task or activity they take up. Given the\nconstraints of time and resources, they have to be selective and consciously choose tospend time on what is most important to them. They have to keep in mind is that whenever\nthey start an activity or task, they are inevitably ruling out everything else they could have\ndone with that time.\nWhen managers have to choose among several tasks, they can use several prioritization\ntools. The key ones are summarized below. It can be very helpful at times to break out of\ntheir routine way of looking at things and to use a tool that they do not use all of the time.\nCovey’s Quadrants\nDiscussed earlier under Time Matrix, Steven Covey describes a high-level prioritization\nTime Management Grid in his book \nThe Seven Habits of Highly Effective People . In this\ngrid, tasks are categorized by four quadrants:\nSoft Skills for Public Managers\n30• Quadrant 1 represents things which are both urgent and important - labelled\n“firefighting”. The activities need to be dealt with immediately, and they are important.\n• Quadrant 2 represents things which are important, but not urgent - labelled “Quality\nTime”. Although the activities here are important, and contribute to achieving thegoals and priorities - they do not have to be done right now. As a result, they can be\nscheduled when they can be given quality thought to them. A good example would\nbe the preparation of an important talk, or mentoring a key individual. Prayer time,family time and personal relaxation/recreation are also part of Quadrant 2.\n• Quadrant 3 represents distractions. They must be dealt with right",

For example, driving can be quadrant 4 if the time is unproductive, but there\nare a number of ways of making this time more productive by learning new skills, planning\nand so on.\nKen Blanchard’s Quadrants\nKen Blanchard - the author of the popular book “The One Minute Manager” and “The On-Time, On-Target Manager” – sets out his quadrants a little differently:\n• Have to Do, Want to Do\n• Have to Do, Don’t Want to Do• Don’t Have to Do, Want to Do• Don’t Have to Do, Don’t Want to Do\nMost of the managers do not have a problem with Quadrants 1 and 4. If It is Quadrant 1,\nthey will willingly do it. If it is Quadrant 4, they never do it. It is Quadrants 2 and 3 where the\nconflict is likely to arise and most of the managers are likely to be attracted to Quadrant 3,\nmeaning things that do not have to be done  get done.\nThe Blanchard advice for the managers is to take up tasks in the order of Quadrant 2 and\nQuadrant 1, and spend little or no time on Quadrant 3 items. To use this model, managershave to chart out to-do list and plan accordingly.\nPaired Comparison\nThe Simple Paired Comparison method uses a simple scoring system for comparing\nactivities. The following example illustrates how this method can be applied:\nHere is the list of example tasks or activities to be performed:1. Call home about dinner plans\nSoft Skills for Public Managers\n322. Fire Venkat\n3. Draft budget report\n4. Respond to e-mails\nCompare the following and put a check mark against the relatively important task of each\ncomparison:\n• 1 to 2, 1 to 3, 1 to 4\n• 2 to 3, 2 to 4• 3 to 4\nLet’s say the result is as follows:\n1. Call home about dinner plans XX\n2. Fire Venkat XXX\n3. Draft budget report X\n4. Respond to e-mails  \nSo, the order you would do the tasks in would be 2, 1, 3, 4.\nThe ABC Method\nThe ABC method ranks tasks into the following categories:\n- ‘A’ are activities which Absolutely must get done now\n- ‘B’ are those that Better get done soon- ‘C’ are those that could wait for now- ‘D’ are those that can be Delegated but require follow up\nThen it subdivides tasks in these categories into A1, A2, A3, ..., B1, B2, ... and so forth.\nA lot of people find this prioritization method helpful.\nHandbook on Time Management Skills\n33The Payoff versus Time Method\nWith this method, the managers have to weigh each task by the payoff they expect\nfrom it versus the time it takes to do it. Tasks that have high payoff and that take little\ntime are the ones they would take up first. Correspondingly, tasks that have",

Night owls might schedule things later.\nSample Daily Planner\nName:                                   Day of Week:                                     Date:\nT=Top Priority   M=Middle Priority   L=Low Priority\nTime   Actually Accomplished           Planned Task To Do Today\n7:30\n8:00\n8:30\n9:00\n9:30\n10:00\n10:30\n11:00\n11:30\nNoon\n12:30\n1:00\n1:30\n2:00\n2:30\n3:00\n3:30\n4:00\n4:30\n5:00\n5:30\nSoft Skills for Public Managers\n36Work your way down from the top items. Only when they are completed should you work on\nthe middle priority tasks. Only when everything else is done should you work on the low\npriority items. You will find that it is often acceptable to ignore the low priority items. While\nscheduling activities, managers need to consider the following points:\n10  Essential Steps in Using A Planner\nOutlined below is a step-by-step approach for using a day planner to manage time\neffectively.\n1. Select a Compatible Time Planner:  A day planner is a device that includes a\ncalendar, space to write “to-do” lists, and space to write telephone numbers,\naddresses, and other/ reference information. It can be a Franklin Planner (simple\npaper-and-pencil type), Day Timer, a fancy electronic organizer or time management\nsoftware on a computer. If techno-savvy, a manager can pick an electronic organizer.\nIf not, a manager can choose the paper-and-pencil method.\n2. Find a Single, Accessible Place to Keep the Planner:  Having selected a planner,\nmanagers should cultivate the habit of keeping it in an exclusively designated andeasily accessible place at home and workplace. An ideal place to keep the planner\ncould be near the telephone",

Ideally, the\nDay Planner should be their integral part and constant companion of managers.\n5.

Use the Day Planner as a Calendar for Everything:  Appointments, and activi-\nties for the day on personal, family and professional fronts should be listed in the\nplanner. It is advisable that activities relating to family and professions are high-\nlighted using different colours. It is also essential that crucial activities or tasks thatneed personal attention and close scrutiny are highlighted using different colours to\nreview their progress from time to time.\n7.

Conduct a Daily Planning Session:  The goal of this session is to plan the upcoming\nday’s activities and develop a plan of attack and to carry  out the same. In addition to\nlisting priorities and reviewing schedules, the planning session is the time to considerexactly how each task will be accomplished.  What materials will be needed? Whatobstacles are likely to be encountered? How can these obstacles be overcome? Theplanning session will thus provide a mental map that guides them in carrying out thetasks on the list\n9. Prioritize ‘To-Do’ List and Action in Accordance with Priorities:  There are\nmany ways to prioritize a “to do” list. One way is to number all of the items on the list\nin order of decreasing priority. Another way is to classify items into one of threecategories: “Essential,” “Important,” and “Do only if I have extra time.” The managers\nshould pick the method that best fits their style, and begin prioritizing their daily “to\ndo” list.Tool 3 : Daily Task List\n•   List everything you’d like to accomplish\n•   Assign value using “ABC” system•   Assign numerical value to each item\nTool 4 : Notes\n•   Carry paper at all times\n•   Make notes\n•   Use full-sized paper\n•   Date notes\n•   File in action file folders\nHandbook on Time Management Skills\n3910.Generate a List of Long-Term Goals and Break the Long-Term Goals into\nSmall, Manageable Chunks:  First, generate a list of all long-term goals. These\nare broad goals to be accomplished over many months and years. Then, take one\ngoal at a time and break it down into small chunks or sub-goals that might beaccomplished on a monthly basis. Assign one sub-goal to each month of the year.\nAt the beginning of the month, conduct a monthly planning session to decide how to\naccomplish the sub-goal over the course of the month. Assign various tasks to\neach week of the month. At the beginning of each week, conduct a weekly planning\nsession to decide how to assign aspects of that week’s sub-goal to the daily tasklists for the entire week. During each daily planning session, plan the details of the\nassigned task that will be performed that day.\nE: Personal Action Plan with a Follow-Up\nIn order to eliminate the time wasters in the work-process, managers need to act to change\nthem.
