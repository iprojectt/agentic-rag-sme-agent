As my\nclassmate took a full swing, the bat slipped out of his hands\nand came ﬂying toward me before striking me directly\nbetween the eyes. I have no memory of the moment of\nimpact.\nThe bat smashed into my face with such force that it\ncrushed my nose into a distorted U -shape. The collision\nsent the soft tissue of my brain slamming into the inside of\nmy skull. Immediately , a wave of swelling surged\nthroughout my head. In a fraction of a second, I had a\nbroken nose, multiple skull fractures, and two shattered\neye sockets.\nWhen I opened my eyes, I saw people staring at me and\nrunning over to help. I looked down and noticed spots of\nred on my clothes. One of my classmates took the shirt oﬀ\nhis back and handed it to me. I used it to plug the stream of\nblood rushing from my broken nose. Shocked and confused,\nI was unaware of how seriously I had been injured.\nMy teacher looped his arm around my shoulder and we\nbegan the long walk to the nurse’s oﬀice: across the ﬁeld,\ndown the hill, and back into school. R andom hands touched\nmy sides, holding me upright. W e took our time and walked\nslowly . Nobody realized that every minute mattered.\nWhen we arrived at the nurse’s oﬀice, she asked me a\nseries of questions.\n“What year is it?”\n“1998,” I answered. It was actually 2002.\n“Who is the president of the United States?”\n“Bill Clinton,” I said. The correct answer was George W .\nBush.\n“What is your mom’s name?”\n“Uh. Um.” I stalled. T en seconds passed.\n“Patti,” I said casually , ignoring the fact that it had taken\nme ten seconds to remember my own mother’s name.\nThat is the last question I remember . My body was\nunable to handle the rapid swelling in my brain and I lost\nconsciousness before the ambulance arrived. Minutes later ,\nI was carried out of school and taken to the local hospital.\nShortly after arriving, my body began shutting down. I\nstruggled with basic functions like swallowing and\nbreathing. I had my ﬁrst seizure of the day . Then I stopped\nbreathing entirely . As the doctors hurried to supply me with\noxygen, they also decided the local hospital was\nunequipped to handle the situation and ordered a\nhelicopter to ﬂy me to a larger hospital in Cincinnati.\nI was rolled out of the emergency room doors and toward\nthe helipad across the street. The stretcher rattled on a\nbumpy sidewalk as one nurse pushed me along while\nanother pumped each breath into me by hand. My mother ,\nwho had arrived at the hospital a few moments before,\nclimbed into the helicopter beside me. I remained\nunconscious and unable to breathe on my own as she held\nmy hand during the ﬂight.\nWhile my mother rode with me in the helicopter , my\nfather went home to check on my brother and sister and\nbreak the news to them. He choked back tears as he\nexplained to my sister that he would miss her eighth-grade\ngraduation ceremony that night. A fter passing my siblings\noﬀ to family and friends, he drove to Cincinnati to meet my\nmother .\nWhen my mom and I landed on the roof of the hospital, a\nteam of nearly twenty doctors and nurses sprinted onto the\nhelipad and wheeled me into the trauma unit. By this time,\nthe swelling in my brain had become so severe that I was\nhaving repeated post-traumatic seizures. My broken bones\nneeded to be ﬁxed, but I was in no condition to undergo\nsurgery . After yet another seizure—my third of the day—I\nwas put into a medically induced coma and placed on a\nventilator .\nMy parents were no strangers to this hospital.

A fter two and a half years of chemotherapy\ntreatments, spinal taps, and bone marrow biopsies, my\nlittle sister ﬁnally walked out of the hospital happy , healthy ,\nand cancer free.

    "text": ", my\nparents found themselves back in the same place with a\ndiﬀerent child.\nWhile I slipped into a coma, the hospital sent a priest and\na social worker to comfort my parents. It was the same\npriest who had met with them a decade earlier on the\nevening they found out my sister had cancer .\nAs day faded into night, a series of machines kept me\nalive. My parents slept restlessly on a hospital mattress—\none moment they would collapse from fatigue, the next\nthey would be wide awake with worry . My mother would\ntell me later , “It was one of the worst nights I’ve ever had.”\nMY RECO VERY\nMercifully , by the next morning my breathing had\nrebounded to the point where the doctors felt comfortable\nreleasing me from the coma. When I ﬁnally regained\nconsciousness, I discovered that I had lost my ability to\nsmell. As a test, a nurse asked me to blow my nose and sniﬀ\nan apple juice box. My sense of smell returned, but—to\neveryone’s surprise—the act of blowing my nose forced air\nthrough the fractures in my eye socket and pushed my left\neye outward. My eyeball bulged out of the socket, held\nprecariously in place by my eyelid and the optic nerve\nattaching my eye to my brain.\nThe ophthalmologist said my eye would gradually slide\nback into place as the air seeped out, but it was hard to tell\nhow long this would take. I was scheduled for surgery one\nweek later , which would allow me some additional time to\nheal. I looked like I had been on the wrong end of a boxing\nmatch, but I was cleared to leave the hospital. I returned\nhome with a broken nose, half a dozen facial fractures, and\na bulging left eye.\nThe following months were hard. It felt like everything in\nmy life was on pause. I had double vision for weeks; I\nliterally couldn’t see straight. It took more than a month,\nbut my eyeball did eventually return to its normal location.\nBetween the seizures and my vision problems, it was eight\nmonths before I could drive a car again. A t physical\ntherapy , I practiced basic motor patterns like walking in a\nstraight line. I was determined not to let my injury get me\ndown, but there were more than a few moments when I felt\ndepressed and overwhelmed.\nI became painfully aware of how far I had to go when I\nreturned to the baseball ﬁeld one year later . Baseball had\nalways been a major part of my life. My dad had played\nminor league baseball for the St. Louis Cardinals, and I had\na dream of playing professionally , too. After months of\nrehabilitation, what I wanted more than anything was to\nget back on the ﬁeld.\nBut my return to baseball was not smooth.

In\nthe messy world of a college dorm, I made a point to keep\nmy room neat and tidy . These improvements were minor ,\nbut they gave me a sense of control over my life. I started\nto feel conﬁdent again. And this growing belief in myself\nrippled into the classroom as I improved my study habits\nand managed to earn straight A ’s during my ﬁrst year .\nA habit is a routine or behavior that is performed\nregularly—and, in many cases, automatically . As each\nsemester passed, I accumulated small but consistent habits\nthat ultimately led to results that were unimaginable to me\nwhen I started. F or example, for the ﬁrst time in my life, I\nmade it a habit to lift weights multiple times per week, and\nin the years that followed, my six -foot-four-inch frame\nbulked up from a featherweight 170 to a lean 200 pounds.\nWhen my sophomore season arrived, I earned a starting\nrole on the pitching staﬀ . By my junior year , I was voted\nteam captain and at the end of the season, I was selected\nfor the all-conference team. But it was not until my senior\nseason that my sleep habits, study habits, and strength-\ntraining habits really began to pay oﬀ .\nSix years after I had been hit in the face with a baseball\nbat, ﬂown to the hospital, and placed into a coma, I was\nselected as the top male athlete at Denison University and\nnamed to the ESPN Academic All-America T eam—an honor\ngiven to just thirty-three players across the country . By the\ntime I graduated, I was listed in the school record books in\neight diﬀerent categories. That same year , I was awarded\nthe university’s highest academic honor , the President’s\nMedal.\nI hope you’ll forgive me if this sounds boastful. T o be\nhonest, there was nothing legendary or historic about my\nathletic career . I never ended up playing professionally .\nHowever , looking back on those years, I believe I\naccomplished something just as rare: I fulﬁlled my\npotential. And I believe the concepts in this book can help\nyou fulﬁll your potential as well.\nWe all face challenges in life. This injury was one of\nmine, and the experience taught me a critical lesson:\nchanges that seem small and unimportant at ﬁrst will\ncompound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick\nwith them for years. We all deal with setbacks but in the\nlong run, the quality of our lives often depends on the\nquality of our habits. W ith the same habits, you’ll end up\nwith the same results. But with better habits, anything is\npossible.\nMaybe there are people who can achieve incredible\nsuccess overnight. I don’t know any of them, and I’m\ncertainly not one of them. There wasn’t one deﬁning\nmoment on my journey from medically induced coma to\nAcademic All-American; there were many . It was a gradual\nevolution, a long series of small wins and tiny\nbreakthroughs. The only way I made progress—the only\nchoice I had—was to start small. And I employed this same\nstrategy a few years later when I started my own business\nand began working on this book.\nHOW AND WHY I WROTE THIS BOOK\nIn November 2012, I began publishing articles at\njamesclear .com. F or years, I had been keeping notes about\nmy personal experiments with habits and I was ﬁnally\nready to share some of them publicly . I began by publishing\na new article every Monday and Thursday . Within a few\nmonths, this simple writing habit led to my ﬁrst one\nthousand email subscribers, and by the end of 2013 that\nnumber had grown to more than thirty thousand people.\nIn 2014, my email list expanded to over one hundred\nthousand subscribers, which made it one of the fastest-\ngrowing newsletters on the internet. I had felt like an\nimpostor when I began writing two years earlier , but now I\nwas becoming known as an expert on habits—a new label\nthat excited me but also felt uncomfortable. I had never\nconsidered myself a master of the topic, but rather\nsomeone who was experimenting alongside my readers.\nIn 2015, I reached two hundred thousand email\nsubscribers and signed a book deal with P enguin R andom\nHouse to begin writing the book you are reading now . As\nmy audience grew , so did my business opportunities. I was\nincreasingly asked to speak at top companies about the",

I had to rely on small habits to rebound\nfrom my injury , to get stronger in the gym, to perform at a\nhigh level on the ﬁeld, to become a writer , to build a\nsuccessful business, and simply to develop into a\nresponsible adult. Small habits helped me fulﬁll my\npotential, and since you picked up this book, I’m guessing\nyou’d like to fulﬁll yours as well.\nIn the pages that follow , I will share a step-by-step plan\nfor building better habits—not for days or weeks, but for a\nlifetime. While science supports everything I’ve written,\nthis book is not an academic research paper; it’s an\noperating manual. Y ou’ll ﬁnd wisdom and practical advice\nfront and center as I explain the science of how to create\nand change your habits in a way that is easy to understand\nand apply .\nThe ﬁelds I draw on—biology , neuroscience, philosophy ,\npsychology , and more—have been around for many years.\nWhat I oﬀer you is a synthesis of the best ideas smart\npeople ﬁgured out a long time ago as well as the most\ncompelling discoveries scientists have made recently . My\ncontribution, I hope, is to ﬁnd the ideas that matter most\nand connect them in a way that is highly actionable.\nAnything wise in these pages you should credit to the many\nexperts who preceded me. Anything foolish, assume it is my\nerror .\nThe backbone of this book is my four-step model of\nhabits—cue, craving, response, and reward—and the four\nlaws of behavior change that evolve out of these steps.\nReaders with a psychology background may recognize\nsome of these terms from operant conditioning, which was\nﬁrst proposed as “ stimulus, response, reward” by B. F .\nSkinner in the 1930s and has been popularized more\nrecently as “ cue, routine, reward” in The P ower of Habit  by\nCharles Duhigg.\nBehavioral scientists like Skinner realized that if you\noﬀered the right reward or punishment, you could get\npeople to act in a certain way . But while Skinner’s model\ndid an excellent job of explaining how external stimuli\ninﬂuenced our habits, it lacked a good explanation for how\nour thoughts, feelings, and beliefs impact our behavior .\nInternal states—our moods and emotions—matter , too. In\nrecent decades, scientists have begun to determine the\nconnection between our thoughts, feelings, and behavior .\nThis research will also be covered in these pages.\nIn total, the framework I oﬀer is an integrated model of\nthe cognitive and behavioral sciences. I believe it is one of\nthe ﬁrst models of human behavior to accurately account\nfor both the inﬂuence of external stimuli and internal\nemotions on our habits. While some of the language may be\nfamiliar , I am conﬁdent",

I was\nincreasingly asked to speak at top companies about the\nscience of habit formation, behavior change, and\ncontinuous improvement. I found myself delivering keynote\nspeeches at conferences in the United States and Europe.\nIn 2016, my articles began to appear regularly in major\npublications like Time , Entrepreneur , and Forbes .\nIncredibly , my writing was read by over eight million\npeople that year . Coaches in the NFL, NBA, and MLB\nbegan reading my work and sharing it with their teams.\nAt the start of 2017, I launched the Habits Academy ,\nwhich became the premier training platform for\norganizations and individuals interested in building better\nhabits in life and work. * Fortune 500 companies and\ngrowing start-ups began to enroll their leaders and train\ntheir staﬀ . In total, over ten thousand leaders, managers,\ncoaches, and teachers have graduated from the Habits\nAcademy , and my work with them has taught me an\nincredible amount about what it takes to make habits work\n",
