During the Gulf W ar, Lieutenant Commander\nMichael Riley saved an entire battleship when he ordered a\nmissile shot down—despite the fact that it looked exactly\nlike the battleship’s own planes on radar .

I’ve even heard of hairdressers\nnoticing whether a client is pregnant based only on the feel\nof her hair .\nThe human brain is a prediction machine. It is\ncontinuously taking in your surroundings and analyzing the\ninformation it comes across. Whenever you experience\nsomething repeatedly—like a paramedic seeing the face of\na heart attack patient or a military analyst seeing a missile\non a radar screen—your brain begins noticing what is\nimportant, sorting through the details and highlighting the\nrelevant cues, and cataloging that information for future\nuse.\nWith enough practice, you can pick up on the cues that\npredict certain outcomes without consciously thinking\nabout it. Automatically , your brain encodes the lessons\nlearned through experience. W e can’t always explain what\nit is we are learning, but learning is happening all along the\nway, and your ability to notice the relevant cues in a given\nsituation is the foundation for every habit you have.\nWe underestimate how much our brains and bodies can\ndo without thinking. Y ou do not tell your hair to grow , your\nheart to pump, your lungs to breathe, or your stomach to\ndigest. And yet your body handles all this and more on\nautopilot. Y ou are much more than your conscious self .\nConsider hunger . How do you know when you’re hungry?\nYou don’t necessarily have to see a cookie on the counter to\nrealize that it is time to eat. Appetite and hunger are\ngoverned nonconsciously . Your body has a variety of\nfeedback loops that gradually alert you when it is time to\neat again and that track what is going on around you and\nwithin you. Cravings can arise thanks to hormones and\nchemicals circulating through your body . Suddenly , you’re\nhungry even though you’re not quite sure what tipped you\noﬀ.\nThis is one of the most surprising insights about our\nhabits: you don’t need to be aware of the cue for a habit to\nbegin. Y ou can notice an opportunity and take action\nwithout dedicating conscious attention to it. This is what\nmakes habits useful.\nIt’s also what makes them dangerous. As habits form,\nyour actions come under the direction of your automatic\nand nonconscious mind. Y ou fall into old patterns before\nyou realize what’s happening. Unless someone",

Y ou fall into old patterns before\nyou realize what’s happening. Unless someone points it out,\nyou may not notice that you cover your mouth with your\nhand whenever you laugh, that you apologize before asking\na question, or that you have a habit of ﬁnishing other\npeople’s sentences. And the more you repeat these\npatterns, the less likely you become to question what\nyou’re doing and why you’re doing it.\nI once heard of a retail clerk who was instructed to cut\nup empty gift cards after customers had used up the\nbalance on the card. One day , the clerk cashed out a few\ncustomers in a row who purchased with gift cards. When\nthe next person walked up, the clerk swiped the customer’s\nactual credit card, picked up the scissors, and then cut it in\nhalf—entirely on autopilot—before looking up at the\nstunned customer and realizing what had just happened.\nAnother woman I came across in my research was a\nformer preschool teacher who had switched to a corporate\njob. Even though she was now working with adults, her old\nhabits would kick in and she kept asking coworkers if they\nhad washed their hands after going to the bathroom. I also\nfound the story of a man who had spent years working as a\nlifeguard and would occasionally yell “ Walk!” whenever he\nsaw a child running.\nOver time, the cues that spark our habits become so\ncommon that they are essentially invisible: the treats on the\nkitchen counter , the remote control next to the couch, the\nphone in our pocket. Our responses to these cues are so\ndeeply encoded that it may feel like the urge to act comes\nfrom nowhere. F or this reason, we must begin the process\nof behavior change with awareness.\nBefore we can eﬀectively build new habits, we need to\nget a handle on our current ones. This can be more\nchallenging than it sounds because once a habit is ﬁrmly\nrooted in your life, it is mostly nonconscious and automatic.\nIf a habit remains mindless, you can’t expect to improve it.\nAs the psychologist Carl Jung said, “ Until you make the\nunconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will\ncall it fate.”\nTHE HABITS SCORECARD\nThe Japanese railway system is regarded as one of the best\nin the world. If you ever ﬁnd yourself riding a train in\nTokyo, you’ll notice that the conductors have a peculiar\nhabit.\nAs each operator runs the train, they proceed through a\nritual of pointing at diﬀerent objects and calling out\ncommands. When the train approaches a signal, the\noperator will point at it and say , “Signal is green.” As the\ntrain pulls into and out of each station, the operator will\npoint at the speedometer and call out the exact speed.\nWhen it’s time to leave, the operator will point at the\ntimetable and state the time. Out on the platform, other\nemployees are performing similar actions. Before each\ntrain departs, staﬀ members will point along the edge of\nthe platform and declare, “ All clear!” Every detail is\nidentiﬁed, pointed at, and named aloud. *\nThis process, known as Pointing-and-Calling , is a safety\nsystem designed to reduce mistakes. It seems silly , but it\nworks incredibly well. Pointing-and-Calling reduces errors\nby up to 85 percent and cuts accidents by 30 percent. The\nMTA subway system in New Y ork City adopted a modiﬁed\nversion that is “point-only ,” and “within two years of\nimplementation, incidents of incorrectly berthed subways\nfell 57 percent.”\nPointing-and-Calling is so eﬀective because it raises the\nlevel of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more\nconscious level. Because the train operators must use their\neyes, hands, mouth, and ears, they are more likely to notice\nproblems before something goes wrong.\nMy wife does something similar . Whenever we are\npreparing to walk out the door for a trip, she verbally calls\nout the most essential items in her packing list. “I’ve got\nmy keys. I’ve got my wallet. I’ve got my glasses. I’ve got my\nhusband.”\nThe more automatic a behavior becomes, the less likely\nwe are to consciously think about it. And when we’ve done\nsomething a thousand times before, we begin to overlook\nthings. W e assume that the next time will be just like the\nlast. W e’re so used to doing what we’ve always done that\nwe don",

W e’re so used to doing what we’ve always done that\nwe don’t stop to question whether it’s the right thing to do\nat all. Many of our failures in performance are largely\nattributable to a lack of self -awareness.\nOne of our greatest challenges in changing habits is\nmaintaining awareness of what we are actually doing. This\nhelps explain why the consequences of bad habits can\nsneak up on us. W e need a “point-and-call” system for our\npersonal lives. That’s the origin of the Habits Scorecard,\nwhich is a simple exercise you can use to become more\naware of your behavior . To create your own, make a list of\nyour daily habits.\nHere’s a sample of where your list might start:\nWake up\nTurn oﬀ alarm\nCheck my phone\nGo to the bathroom\nWeigh myself\nTake a shower\nBrush my teeth\nFloss my teeth\nPut on deodorant\nHang up towel to dry\nGet dressed\nMake a cup of tea\n. . . and so on.\nOnce you have a full list, look at each behavior , and ask\nyourself , “Is this a good habit, a bad habit, or a neutral\nhabit?” If it is a good habit, write “+” next to it. If it is a\nbad habit, write “–”. If it is a neutral habit, write “=”.\nFor example, the list above might look like this:\nWake up =\nTurn oﬀ alarm =\nCheck my phone –\nGo to the bathroom =\nWeigh myself +\nTake a shower +\nBrush my teeth +\nFloss my teeth +\nPut on deodorant +\nHang up towel to dry =\nGet dressed =\nMake a cup of tea +\nThe marks you give to a particular habit will depend on\nyour situation and your goals. F or someone who is trying to\nlose weight, eating a bagel with peanut butter every\nmorning might be a bad habit. F or someone who is trying\nto bulk up and add muscle, the same behavior might be a\ngood habit. It all depends on what you’re working toward. *\nScoring your habits can be a bit more complex for\nanother reason as well. The labels “good habit” and “bad\nhabit” are slightly inaccurate. There are no good habits or\nbad habits. There are only eﬀective habits. That is, eﬀective\nat solving problems. All habits serve you in some way—\neven the bad ones—which is why you repeat them. F or this\nexercise, categorize your habits by how they will beneﬁt\nyou in the long run. Generally speaking, good habits will\nhave net positive outcomes. Bad habits have net negative\noutcomes. Smoking a cigarette may reduce stress right\nnow (that’s how it’s serving you), but it’s not a healthy\nlong-term behavior .\nIf you’re still having trouble determining how to rate a\nparticular habit, here is a question I like to use: “Does this\nbehavior help me become the type of person I wish to be?\nDoes this habit cast a vote for or against my desired\nidentity?” Habits that reinforce your desired identity are\nusually good. Habits that conﬂict with your desired identity\nare usually bad.\nAs you create your Habits Scorecard, there is no need to\nchange anything at ﬁrst. The goal is to simply notice what\nis actually going on. Observe your thoughts and actions\nwithout judgment or internal criticism. Don’t blame\nyourself for your faults.

It adds weight to the action\nrather than letting yourself mindlessly slip into an old\nroutine. This approach is useful even if you’re simply trying\nto remember a task on your to-do list.
