As a result, they reinforce your\nbehavior and add a little bit of immediate satisfaction to\nany activity . Visual measurement comes in many forms:\nfood journals, workout logs, loyalty punch cards, the\nprogress bar on a software download, even the page\nnumbers in a book. But perhaps the best way to measure\nyour progress is with a habit tracker .\nHOW TO KEEP Y OUR HABITS ON TRACK\nA habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did\na habit. The most basic format is to get a calendar and\ncross oﬀ each day you stick with your routine. F or example,\nif you meditate on Monday , Wednesday , and Friday , each of\nthose dates gets an X. As time rolls by , the calendar\nbecomes a record of your habit streak.\nCountless people have tracked their habits, but perhaps\nthe most famous was Benjamin Franklin. Beginning at age\ntwenty , Franklin carried a small booklet everywhere he\nwent and used it to track thirteen personal virtues. This list\nincluded goals like “Lose no time. Be always employed in\nsomething useful” and “ Avoid triﬂing conversation.” A t the\nend of each day , Franklin would open his booklet and\nrecord his progress.\nJerry Seinfeld reportedly uses a habit tracker to stick\nwith his streak of writing jokes. In the documentary\nComedian , he explains that his goal is simply to “never\nbreak the chain” of writing jokes every day . In other words,\nhe is not focused on how good or bad a particular joke is or\nhow inspired he feels. He is simply focused on showing up\nand adding to his streak.\n“Don’t break the chain” is a powerful mantra. Don’t\nbreak the chain of sales calls and you’ll build a successful\nbook of business. Don’t break the chain of workouts and\nyou’ll get ﬁt faster than you’d expect. Don’t break the chain\nof creating every day and you will end up with an\nimpressive portfolio . Habit tracking is powerful because it\nleverages multiple Laws of Behavior Change. It\nsimultaneously makes a behavior obvious, attractive, and\nsatisfying.\nLet’s break down each one.\nBeneﬁt #1: Habit tracking is obvious.\nRecording your last action creates a trigger that can\ninitiate your next one. Habit tracking naturally builds a\nseries of visual cues like the streak of X’s on your calendar\nor the list of meals in your food log. When you look at the\ncalendar and see your streak, you’ll be reminded to act\nagain. Research has shown that people who track their\nprogress on goals like losing weight, quitting smoking, and\nlowering blood pressure are all more likely to improve than\nthose who don’t. One study of more than sixteen hundred\npeople found that those who kept a daily food log lost twice\nas much weight as those who did not. The mere act of\ntracking a behavior can spark the urge to change it.\nHabit",

The mere act of\ntracking a behavior can spark the urge to change it.\nHabit tracking also keeps you honest. Most of us have a\ndistorted view of our own behavior . We think we act better\nthan we do . Measurement oﬀers one way to overcome our\nblindness to our own behavior and notice what’s really\ngoing on each day . One glance at the paper clips in the\ncontainer and you immediately know how much work you\nhave (or haven’t) been putting in. When the evidence is\nright in front of you, you’re less likely to lie to yourself .\nBeneﬁt #2: Habit tracking is attractive.\nThe most eﬀective form of motivation is progress. When we\nget a signal that we are moving forward, we become more\nmotivated to continue down that path. In this way , habit\ntracking can have an addictive eﬀect on motivation. Each\nsmall win feeds your desire.\nThis can be particularly powerful on a bad day . When\nyou’re feeling down, it’s easy to forget about all the\nprogress you have already made. Habit tracking provides\nvisual proof of your hard work—a subtle reminder of how\nfar you’ve come.

It feels easier to say , “I’ll just eat less.” Or , “I’ll try\nharder .” Or, “I’ll remember to do it.” P eople inevitably tell\nme things like, “I have a decision journal, but I wish I used\nit more.” Or , “I recorded my workouts for a week, but then\nquit.” I’ve been there myself .

It is better to consistently track one habit\nthan to sporadically track ten.\nFinally , record each measurement immediately after the\nhabit occurs. The completion of the behavior is the cue to\nwrite it down. This approach allows you to combine the\nhabit-stacking method mentioned in Chapter 5 with habit\ntracking.\nThe habit stacking + habit tracking formula is:\nAfter [CURRENT HABIT], I will [TRACK MY\nHABIT].\nAfter I hang up the phone from a sales call, I will move\none paper clip over .\nAfter I ﬁnish each set at the gym, I will record it in my\nworkout journal.\nAfter I put my plate in the dishwasher , I will write\ndown what I ate.\nThese tactics can make tracking your habits easier . Even\nif you aren’t the type of person who enjoys recording your\nbehavior , I think you’ll ﬁnd a few weeks of measurements\nto be insightful. It’s always interesting to see how you’ve\nactually  been spending your time.\nThat said, every habit streak ends at some point. And,\nmore important than any single measurement, is having a\ngood plan for when your habits slide oﬀ track.\nHOW TO RECO VER QUICKL Y WHEN Y OUR HABITS\nBREAK DOWN\nNo matter how consistent you are with your habits, it is\ninevitable that life will interrupt you at some point.\nPerfection is not possible. Before long, an emergency will\npop up—you get sick or you have to travel for work or your\nfamily needs a little more of your time.\nWhenever this happens to me, I try to remind myself of a\nsimple rule: never miss twice.\nIf I miss one day , I try to get back into it as quickly as\npossible. Missing one workout happens, but I’m not going\nto miss two in a row . Maybe I’ll eat an entire pizza, but I’ll\nfollow it up with a healthy meal. I can’t be perfect, but I\ncan avoid a second lapse. As soon as one streak ends, I get\nstarted on the next one.\nThe ﬁrst mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is the\nspiral of repeated mistakes that follows. Missing once is an\naccident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit.\nThis is a distinguishing feature between winners and\nlosers. Anyone can have a bad performance, a bad workout,\nor a bad day at work. But when successful people fail, they\nrebound quickly . The breaking of a habit doesn’t matter if\nthe reclaiming of it is fast.\nI think this principle is so important that I’ll stick to it\neven if I can’t do a habit as well or as completely as I would\nlike. T oo often, we fall into an all-or-nothing cycle with our\nhabits. The problem is not slipping up; the problem is\nthinking that if you can’t do something perfectly , then you\nshouldn’t do it at all.\nYou don’t realize how valuable it is to just show up on\nyour bad (or busy) days.

    "text": " tracker—is measuring\nthe wrong thing.\nKNOWING WHEN (AND WHEN NOT) TO TRACK A HABIT\nSay you’re running a restaurant and you want to know if\nyour chef is doing a good job. One way to measure success\nis to track how many customers pay for a meal each day . If\nmore customers come in, the food must be good. If fewer\ncustomers come in, something must be wrong.\nHowever , this one measurement—daily revenue—only\ngives a limited picture of what’s really going on. Just\nbecause someone pays for a meal doesn’t mean they enjoy\nthe meal. Even dissatisﬁed customers are unlikely to dine\nand dash. In fact, if you’re only measuring revenue, the\nfood might be getting worse but you’re making up for it\nwith marketing or discounts or some other method.\nInstead, it may be more eﬀective to track how many\ncustomers ﬁnish  their meal or perhaps the percentage of\ncustomers who leave a generous tip.\nThe dark side of tracking a particular behavior is that we\nbecome driven by the number rather than the purpose\nbehind it. If your success is measured by quarterly\nearnings, you will optimize sales, revenue, and accounting\nfor quarterly earnings. If your success is measured by a\nlower number on the scale, you will optimize for a lower\nnumber on the scale, even if that means embracing crash\ndiets, juice cleanses, and fat-loss pills. The human mind\nwants to “win” whatever game is being played.\nThis pitfall is evident in many areas of life. W e focus on\nworking long hours instead of getting meaningful work\ndone. W e care more about getting ten thousand steps than\nwe do about being healthy . We teach for standardized tests\ninstead of emphasizing learning, curiosity , and critical\nthinking. In short, we optimize for what we measure. When\nwe choose the wrong measurement, we get the wrong\nbehavior .\nThis is sometimes referred to as Goodhart’s Law . Named\nafter the economist Charles Goodhart, the principle states,\n“When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good\nmeasure.” Measurement is only useful when it guides you\nand adds context to a larger picture, not when it consumes\nyou. Each number is simply one piece of feedback in the\noverall system.\nIn our data-driven world, we tend to overvalue numbers\nand undervalue anything ephemeral, soft, and diﬀicult to\nquantify . We mistakenly think the factors we can measure\nare the only factors that exist. But just because you can\nmeasure something doesn’t mean it’s the most important\nthing. And just because you can’t  measure something\ndoesn’t mean it’s not important at all.\nAll of this to say , it’s crucial to keep habit tracking in its\nproper place. It can feel satisfying to record a habit and\ntrack your progress, but the measurement is not the only\nthing that matters. Furthermore, there are many ways to\nmeasure progress, and sometimes it helps to shift your\nfocus to something entirely diﬀerent.\nThis is why nonscale victories  can be eﬀective for weight\nloss. The number on the scale may be stubborn, so if you\nfocus solely on that number , your motivation will sag. But\nyou may notice that your skin looks better or you wake up\nearlier or your sex drive got a boost. All of these are valid\nways to track your improvement. If you’re not feeling\nmotivated by the number on the scale, perhaps it’s time to\nfocus on a diﬀerent measurement—one that gives you more\nsignals of progress.\nNo matter how you measure your improvement, habit\ntracking oﬀers a simple way to make your habits more\nsatisfying. Each measurement provides a little bit of\nevidence that you’re moving in the right direction and a\nbrief moment of immediate pleasure for a job well done.\nChapter Summary\nOne of the most satisfying feelings is the feeling of\nmaking progress.\nA habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you\ndid a habit—like marking an X on a calendar .\nHabit trackers and other visual forms of measurement\ncan make your habits satisfying by providing clear\nevidence of your progress.\nDon’t break the chain. Try to keep your habit streak\nalive.\nNever miss twice. If you miss one day , try to get back\non track as quickly as possible.\nJust because you can measure something doesn’t mean\nit’s the most important thing.",
