In these circumstances, who hasn’t felt the need to put off that task, to “come up for \nair”? Who hasn’t had that unpleasant sensation of depending on time, chasing after \nappointments, giving up what one loves to do for lack of time? \n“Remember, Time is a greedy player who wi ns without cheating, every round!” writes \nBaudelaire in his poem “The Clock” (1). Is this the true nature of time? Or is it only one of the \npossible ways to consider time? And more generally speaking, why do people have such a \nproblem in the way they relate to time? Where does it come from, this anxiety that we’ve all \nexperienced at the thought that “time is slipping away”? \nThinkers, philosophers, scientists – anyone who’s taken on the challenge of attempting \nto define time in and of itself and the relationship between people and time has always been \nforced to admit defeat. Such an inquiry, in fact, is inevitably limited and never complete. Few \nhave given us any truly insightful perspectives. For example, according to the work of \nBergson (3) and Minkowski (16), two profoundly interrelated aspects seem to coexist with \nreference to time: \n! Becoming . An abstract, dimensional aspect of time, which gives rise to the habit of \nmeasuring time (seconds, minutes, hours); the id ea of representing time on an axis, as we \nwould spatial dimensions; the concept of the duration of an event (the distance between two \npoints on the temporal axis); the idea of be ing late (once again the distance between two \npoints on the temporal axis).  \n! The succession of events. A concrete aspect of temporal order: we wake up, we take a \nshower, we have breakfast, we study, we have lunch, we have a nap, we play, we eat, and \nwe go to bed. Children come to have this notion of time before they develop the idea of \nabstract time which passes regardless of  the events that take place (16). \nOf these two aspects, it is becoming that generates anxiety – it is, by nature, elusive, \nindefinite, infinite: time passes, slips away, moves toward the future (16). If we try to measure \nourselves against the passage of time, we feel inadequate, oppressed, enslaved, defeated, more \nand more with every second that goes by. We lose  our élan vital (3), our vital contact, which \nenables us to accomplish things. “Two hours ha ve gone by and I’m still not done; two days \nhave gone by and I’m still not done.” In a moment of weakness, the purpose of the activity at \nhand is often no longer even clear. The succession of events, instead, seems to be the less \nanxiety-ridden aspect of time. At times it may ev en represent the regular succession of activity, \na calm-inducing rhythm. \n \n1.1 Goals of the Pomodoro Technique \nThe aim of the Pomodoro Technique is to provide a simple tool/process for improving \nproductivity (your own and that of your team) which is able to do the following:   \n! Alleviate anxiety linked to becoming  \n! Enhance focus and concentration by cutting down on interruptions \n! Increase awareness of your decisions \n! Boost motivation and keep it constant \n! Bolster the determination to achieve your goals \n! Refine the estimation process, both in qualitative and quantitative terms  \n! Improve your work or study process \n! Strengthen your determination to keep on applying yourself in the face of complex \nsituations \nThe Pomodoro Technique 4 \n \n \n© Francesco Cirillo 19/10/2006  \n1.2 Basic Assumptions \nThe Pomodoro Technique is founded on three basic assumptions:   \n! A different way of seeing time (no longer focused on the concept of becoming)  alleviates \nanxiety and in doing so leads to enhanced personal effectiveness. \n! Better use of the mind enables us to achie ve greater clarity of thought, higher \nconsciousness, and sharper focus, al l the while facilitating learning. \n! Employing easy-to-use, unobtrusive tools reduces the complexity of applying the \nTechnique while favoring continuity, and allows you to concentrate your efforts on the \nactivities you want to accomplish. Many time management techniques fail because they \nsubject the people who use them to a higher level of added complexity with respect to the \nintrinsic complexity of the task at hand. \n  The primary inspiration for Pomodoro Technique was drawn from the following ideas: \ntime-boxing (14), the cognitive techniques described by Buzan, among",
