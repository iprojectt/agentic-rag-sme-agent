Clarity  is perhaps the most important concept\nin personal productivity. The number one reason why some people\nget more work done faster is because they are absolutely clear about\ntheir goals and objectives and they don’t deviate from them.\nThe greater clarity you have regarding what you want and the steps you\nwill have to take to achieve it, the easier it will be for you to overcome\nprocrastination, eat your frog and complete the task before you.\nA major reason for procrastination and lack of motivation is\nvagueness, confusion and fuzzy mindedness about what it is you are\ntrying to do, and in what order and for what reason. You must avoid\nthis common condition with all your strength by striving for ever\ngreater clarity in your major goals and tasks.\nHere is a great rule for success: \"Think on paper.\"\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 17Only about 3% of adults have clear, written goals. These people\naccomplish five and ten times as much as people of equal or better\neducation and ability but who, for whatever reason, have never taken\nthe time to write out exactly what it is they want.\nThere is a powerful formula for setting and achieving goals that you\ncan use for the rest of your life. It consists of seven simple steps. Any\none of these steps can double and triple your productivity if you arenot currently using it. Many of my graduates have increased theirincomes dramatically in a matter of a few years, or even a few\nmonths, with this simple, seven-part method.\nStep One : Decide exactly what you want.\n Either decide for yourself or sit down with your boss and discuss\nyour goals and objectives until you are absolutely, crystal clear aboutwhat is expected of you and in what order of priority. It is amazing\nhow many people are working away, day after day, on low value\ntasks because they have not had this critical discussion with their\nmanager.\nRule: “One of the very worst uses of time is to do something very\nwell that need not be done at all.”\nStephen Covey says that, \"Before you begin scrambling up the ladder\nof success, make sure that it is leaning against the right building.\"\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 18Step Two: Write it down.\nThink on paper. When you write your goal down, you crystallize it\nand give it tangible form. You create something that you can touchand see. On the other hand, a goal or objective that is not in writing ismerely a wish or a fantasy. It has no energy behind it. Unwritten\ngoals lead to confusion, vagueness, misdirection and numerous\nmistakes.\nStep Three: Set a deadline on your goal. Set sub-deadlines if\nnecessary.\nA goal or decision without a deadline has no urgency.  It has no real\nbeginning or end. Without a definite deadline accompanied by the\nassignment or acceptance of specific responsibilities for completion,\nyou will naturally procrastinate and get very little done.\nStep Four: Make a list of everything that you can think of that you\nare going to have to do to achieve your goal.\nAs you think of new activities, add them to your list. Keep building\nyour list until it is complete. A list gives you a visual picture of the\nlarger task or objective. It gives you a track to run on. It dramatically\nincreases the likelihood that you will achieve your goal as you have\ndefined it and on schedule.\nStep Five: Organize the list into a plan.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 19Organize your list by priority and sequence . Take a few minutes to\ndecide what you need to do first and what you can do later. Decide\nwhat has to be done before something else and what needs to be\ndone afterwards. Even better, lay out your plan visually, in the formof a series of boxes and circles on a sheet of paper, with lines andarrows showing the relationship of each task to each other task.\nYou’ll be amazed at how much easier it is to achieve your goal when\nyou break it down into individual tasks.\nWith a written goal and an organized plan of action, you will be far\nmore productive and efficient than someone who is carrying his goals\naround in his mind.\nStep Six : Take action on your plan immediately.\nDo something. Do anything. An average plan vigorously executed is\nfar better than a brilliant plan on which nothing is done. For",

An average plan vigorously executed is\nfar better than a brilliant plan on which nothing is done. For you to\nachieve any kind of success, execution is everything.\nStep Seven : Resolve to do something every single day that moves\nyou toward your major goal.Build this activity into your daily schedule. You may read a specific\nnumber of pages on a key subject. You could call on a specific\nnumber of prospects or customers. You can engage in a specific\nperiod of physical exercise. You can learn a certain number of new\nwords in a foreign language. Whatever it is, you must never miss a\nday.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 20Keep pushing forward. Once you start moving, keep moving. Don’t stop.\nThis decision, this discipline alone, can dramatically increase your speed\nof goal accomplishment and boost your personal productivity.\nThe Power of Written Goals\nClear written goals have a wonderful effect on your thinking. They\nmotivate you and galvanize you into action. They stimulate yourcreativity, release your energy and help you to overcomeprocrastination as much as any other factor.\nGoals are the fuel in the furnace of achievement. The bigger your\ngoals and the clearer they are, the more excited you become about\nachieving them. The more you think about your goals, the greater\nbecomes your inner drive and desire to accomplish them.\nThink about your goals and review them daily. Every morning when\nyou begin, take action on the most important task you can\naccomplish to achieve your most important goal at the moment.\nEat That Frog!\n1.  Take a clean sheet of paper right now and make out a list of ten\ngoals you want to accomplish in the next year. Write your goals as\nthough a year has already passed and they are now a reality.\nUse the present tense, positive and personal case so that they are\nimmediately accepted by your subconscious mind.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 21For example, you would write. “I earn X number of dollars per year.”\nOr “I weigh X number of pounds.” Or “I drive such and such a car.”\n2. Review your list of ten goals and select the one goal that, if you\nachieved it, would have the greatest positive impact on your life.\nWhatever that goal is, write it on a separate sheet of paper, set a\ndeadline, make a plan, take action on your plan and then do\nsomething every single day that moves you toward that goal. This\nexercise alone could change your life!",
