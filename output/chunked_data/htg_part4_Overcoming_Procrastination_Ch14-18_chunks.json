Your son will return from school in half an hour. \nYou'd like to start on a painting you've been thinking about \nfor weeks, but you wash up a few dirty dishes and mop the \nkitchen floor instead. After all, how can you possibly accom­\nplish anything on your painting when you know you'll be in­\nterrupted so soon? \nOr suppose you're at work and you've just finished a phone \ncall. As you put down the receiver, you think to yourself that \nthe best use of your time right now—the A-l—is to start \nwork on the time-consuming, complex task of preparing the \nannual budget for your department. You glance at your \nwatch. It's ten minutes before you usually go to lunch. A \nstack of routine paperwork is sitting on one corner of your \ndesk, awaiting your attention. What should you do? Get a \ncouple of quick paperwork Cs out of the way? Or put ten \nminutes into the A-l-task, even though you feel quite over­\nwhelmed by the prospect? Or go to lunch early? \nThe best answer—which is to get started on that Over­\nwhelming A-l even with only a few minutes at your dis­\nposal—seem unrealistic, even meaningless. You may well \ndecide to get a few easy C's out of the way instead. On the \nface of it, this does not seem to be a very serious breach of \ngood time-management practices, except that a person's day is \ntypically",

On the \nface of it, this does not seem to be a very serious breach of \ngood time-management practices, except that a person's day is \ntypically divided up into bits and pieces. Let's face it: Large \nblocks of uninterrupted time are a comparative rarity. If \nagain and again—a few minutes before lunch or before your \nchild returns from school—you choose to work on the easy C \n104 ALAN LAKEIN \nrather than to begin the difficult A-l, then you are procras­\ntinating; you're avoiding what is really important. \nIn most cases, when a person turns to the short and easy \nC, he does so precisely because it is short and easy. What you \nneed is some way to make the Overwhelming A-l competi­\ntive with the easy C. \nBut how? Let's say you have estimated that it'll take you \nfifty hours to formulate the budget, and you have only those \nten minutes available before lunch. The fact that you cannot \nfind anything like fifty hours today may well cause you to put \noff starting the project until tomorrow. But of course there \naren't fifty hours available the next day either, so you may \ndelay day after day until, with the deadline looming, you fi­\nnally make a frantic effort to get the job done—and probably \nnone too well, because you're in such a rush. \nThe key to getting an Overwhelming A-l under control is \nto get started on it as soon as you've identified it as the A-l \ntask. And an excellent way to get moving is to turn such an \nOverwhelming A-l into \"Swiss Cheese\" by poking some holes \nin it. I call these holes \"instant tasks.\" \nAn instant task requires five minutes or less of your time \nand makes some sort of hole in your Overwhelming A-l. So \nin ten minutes before lunch you have time for two instant \ntasks. To find out what the first two should be, (1) make a \nlist of possible instant tasks, and (2) set priorities. \nHere are some Swiss Cheese moves toward tackling the \nbudget problem: getting a copy of last year's budget, decid­\ning on the people you'll need to contact, obtaining the files \nyou'll need, arranging a meeting to discuss the budget, or \ngoing to lunch with a subordinate and turning over part of \nthe task (or all the preliminaries) to him. The only rule for \nmaking up your list of possible instant tasks is to limit it to \nitems that can be started quickly and easily and are in some \nway connected with working on the Overwhelming A-l. \nWhat Five Minutes Can Do \nThe underlying assumption of the Swiss Cheese approach is \nthat it is indeed possible to get something started in five min­\nutes or less. And once you've started, you've given yourself \nthe opportunity to keep going. For example, you may be­\ncome so interested in reading one of the files that you study \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 105 \nit for forty-five minutes before realizing how hungry you are. \nSwiss Cheese may well become your lunch—non-fattening \nbut eminently satisfying. \nIt's just as likely that you will start somewhere only to find \nthat it quickly leads to a dead end. You try to call someone \nto arrange a meeting on the budget for after lunch. He's not \navailable until tomorrow. So now you feel satisfied that \nyou've done your bit on that project for the day. You may \neven be glad to have failed in your first effort; it's such a \nconvenient excuse for further procrastination! That's an un­\npromising start Swiss Cheese is supposed to lead to involve­\nment. \nSo if that first effort failed, be patient for another moment. \nThink of a new instant task and give it a try. \nDon't try to bite the same hole out of the cheese twice. If \nyou've tried an instant task and it didn't lead to involvement, \nthe next step is to try another instant task right away. And \nremember: One hole does not make a piece of Swiss Cheese. \nIt may take a number of instant tasks before you finally get \ninvolved with the big A-l and gather the momentum needed \nto stay with it \nOne nice thing about the Swiss Cheese method is that it \ndoesn't really matter what instant task you select as long as \nit's (1) easy—the easier the better—and (2) related to the \nOverwhelming A-l. How much of a contribution a particular \ninstant task will make to getting your A-l done is far less im­\nportant than the overriding objective of the moment: To do \nsomething—anything—on the A-l.

Maybe the same trick will work again tomor­\nrow. Maybe you might gradually increase the time to six, \nseven, or possibly eight minutes. \nBack at work you find that you can use this \"quit in five \nminutes\" teaser to get yourself involved. You realize that you \nare delaying the A-l project because you fear the worst, but \nonce you get into it things will not be as awful as you imag­\nine them to be (isn't that often the case?).

If that's your trouble, you probably \nneed to do more detailed planning. As a general rule, the \nmore detailed the plan, the better the chance that action will \nfollow. And remember: Planning is really decision-making. \nFirst, I'm going to show you how to make some decisions \nto solidify your feelings about the A-l. \nTake a piece of paper and head it \"I have decided.\" You \nare now ready for five minutes of Decision Time. \nRecord on the paper whatever decisions come to your \nmind about the A-l. For instance: when to start it; what to \ndo first; what to do next; how much time you can devote to \nit all together; what information you need; what equipment is \nrequired; who else will be involved. The more concrete deci­\nsions you can make, the more likely it is you'll fix on some \nsimple but valuable ways to start on the A-l and get in­\nvolved. \nIf you run into snags doing this kind of detailed planning, I \nrecommend you try \"The Magic If.\" \nAdmit to yourself: \"I just cannot plan.\" Then say to your­\nself, \"But if I could plan, what would the plan be?\" Now, set \nabout to answer the if question. The beauty of the \"I can't \n. . . but if I could . . . question is that it temporarily frees you \nfrom all the limitations and problems you face.

But I knew nothing about the materials or tools I \nwas going to need. I never did start working on my patio. \nThis is a common chain, and a deadly one. You don't have \nthe information. You don't get really interested. You can't \nbecome involved. No action. \nThe old adage about familiarity breeding contempt is often \nuntrue. Non-familiarity often leads to lack of interest. I once \nread of an experiment with high school students who were \npresented with a list of forty-eight questions about inverte­\nbrate animals. The students were asked to indicate the twelve \nquestions to which they would most like to know the answers. \nSurprise! Questions about familiar animals were picked more \noften than questions about unfamiliar animals. \nIn another study, students were shown some unusual ob­\njects borrowed from museums. The experimenter went \nthrough the collection of objects three times, giving more in-prepared your plan, the entire burden of carrying out the \nplan will be shifted to his shoulders. You never have to do \nanything. Your only task is to plan how someone else should \ndo it. \nNow, what would you recommend to this person? Don't \nworry if some of the steps you recommend might be difficult \nfor you. The other fellow will be the one to do them—that is \nwhat he's there for. \nNext, put the written plan in the center of your desk and \ntake a break. Go to the water cooler. Talk with a friend. \nRelax. When you return to your desk, look at the written \nplan the other person is going to follow and see if there is \nanything you might do to help him out.

Talking is a pleasant way to get more in­\nformation about your A-l. \n112 ALAN LAKEIN \nTry a Leading Task \nWhen you really aren't quite up to doing anything on your \nA-,1, but are not averse to getting ready to do something, \ntaking a physical step can often be a way of easing yourself \ngradually into the big job. I call this a \"leading task\" because \nit leads you on. \nAn obvious instant task to get you started on writing a re­\nport is to make some notes on the points to be covered. But \nsuppose even this seems too much to tackle. Try sharpening a \npencil. I'm not joking! Involvement will not necessarily ensue, \nbut at least there is a chance that, once you have the freshly \nsharpened pencil in your hand, you will let the pencil impel \nyou to write a few words of value before you put it down \nagain. \nThe physical presence of some item associated with your \nA-l can also be a compelling stimulus leading to involve­\nment. A good leading task is to move such an item to a con­\nspicuous place. You have a letter that you know you should \nanswer, but have been avoiding. Try putting it right in the \nmiddle of your desk. This increases the chance that sooner or \nlater you will pick it up and get started on a reply, perhaps \nwhen you are seeking diversion from some other task. An­\nother good leading task is to remove all distractions from \nyour desktop (such as expense accounts, cocktail-party invita­\ntions, or that copy of Playboy). Your chances that you will \nturn to the A-l will materially increase if it's the only item \nstaring you in the face. \nIf you really want to read War and Peace, but just don't \nseem to get around to it, here are some good leading tasks. \nBuy a copy. Take it off your bookshelf. Put it in your favor­\nite reading chair. Leave it lying around opened to page 1. \nShow it to a friend and say, \"I've finally started on this!\" \nPeople often tell me about some hobby they once enjoyed \nbut now only dream about. One man told me how much he \nregretted that he hadn't played tennis in five years. I learned \nthat his tennis racket was at the bottom of a storage chest, \nand that the only tennis balls he owned were old and had no \nbounce. No wonder playing tennis was just a dream for himl \nDoing a leading task would certainly increase this man's \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 113 \nchances of once again enjoying a game of tennis.

Many of us do mis without \neven thinking about it. If you look directly at a speaker, \nyou're more likely to listen to him. If you stand up and \nstretch during an evening's reading, you are less likely to fall \nasleep. Consciously look for opportunities to use these kinds \nof physical actions to help you do what you want, and you'll \nfind them. \nStill another useful leading task is to \"select the right chan­\nnel.\" That is: If you have nothing to say, at least turn your \nmind toward the outlet that you'd use if you were full of \nideas. If you must type something, turn on the typewriter. \n114 ALAN LAKEIN \nTitle a page something like \"I can't think of anything to \ntype.\" Then pour out your soul to the typewriter—type any­\nthing that goes through your mind, anything at all. After \ndoing this for a while, your mind may be jogged so you're \nready to put a fresh piece of paper in the typewriter and \nstart typing something connected with the A-l. \nIf you need to dictate, turn on your dictation machine and \nkeep it on even if you don't have anything to say. Gradually, \nthe running dictation belt may start to pull you along, almost \nforcing you to find something to say. Once the words have \nbegun to flow, you can direct them toward the A-l. If you \ndo not turn on your dictation machine until you have pre­\ncisely the \"right thing\" to say, you may never get started. \nIf you are having trouble making an important telephone \ncall, pick up the phone and call a friend. Try to explain to \nyour friend that it's impossible for you to pick up the \nphone, dial the numbers, say hello, and talk to this other per­\nson. But wait! You've just done it. If you can do it once, you \ncan do it again and make that A-l call. \nLeading yourself toward the A-l in this way will not al­\nways work. But I have observed many times that a simple \nphysical action does indeed lead to meaningful involvement \nTake Advantage of Your Current Mood \nOne reason why people have difficulty getting involved in \ntheir A-l is that it often requires doing something they're not \nemotionally prepared to do. Perhaps getting started on your \nA-l means sitting quietly at your desk thinking, when what \nyou really feel like doing is talking to someone. Now you \nhave two options: To forget all about your decision to get \nstarted on the A-l and talk to someone just for the sake of \ntalking, or to take advantage of your mood by letting it carry \nyou toward the A-l, rather than away from it \nThe idea is to take your emotional need and see whether it \nis possible to satisfy it in some way connected with the A-l. \nIn the example I just gave, clearly the best use of your time \nwould be to go to talk to someone who is concerned with \nyour A-l and see what ideas he or she can share with you. \nAfter satisfying your need for companionship, and hopefully \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LD7B 115 \ngetting some good ideas in the bargain, you may find it much \neasier to return to your desk and do the required thinking. \nThe reverse twist of this—leading to procrastination rather \nthan forward movement—happens daily in most stock-\nbrokerage offices.

You \ncould arrange all your papers connected with the A-l in al­\nphabetical order, dot all the i's and cross all the t's, make neat \nlists of things to do on the A-l (without any feeling of ever \nhaving to do them), or rewrite a memo about the A-l even \nthough the memo really needs no further polishing. \nYou might well ask me at this point, \"Aren't I better off \ndoing something worthwhile that is not connected with the \nA-l rather than doing something trivial on the A-l?\" \nMy emphatic answer to this question is \"Nol\" \nIf you tell me you've been procrastinating and are not able \nto get involved in the A-l, do anything, regardless of impor­\ntance, so long as it has some connection with the A-l. Once \nyou're involved, your sense of priorities will lead you eventu­\nally to do more productive work on the A-l. But if you turn \nto some other activity, you've done nothing to try to halt the \nprocrastination mechanism, and you've given yourself no \nchance to become involved. \nSometimes it's best to wait until your mood is right for \ndoing something. You don't want to use up too much energy \ntrying to force yourself to do something that you don't want \nto do. But often—especially if the task you have identified as \n116 ALAN LAKEIN \nyour A-l is fairly complex and involves a number of steps— \nthere is an excellent chance that at least one particular aspect \nof the project will fit your current mood. Your job is to find \nthat soft spot \nA good question to ask yourself at this point is \"What am \nI willing to do on the A-l?\" You might say to yourself, \"I \nknow there are plenty of things about this A-l that I don't \nfeel like doing now, but is there anything I find interesting, or \nappealing, or at least tolerable?\" \nFind some piece of the A-l that you're in the mood to do. \nThen you will be using your existing needs to lead you \ntoward the A-l rather than letting them lead you away from \nit. \nSay you're writing a book. At this moment you're not in­\nterested in rewriting any of the dozen chapters that will have \nto be completely reworked. You do feel like reading the edi­\ntor's comments on those chapters that are in pretty good \nshape, and that require little effort on your part to finish up. \nOr you face a big exam. You're not quite ready to read \nthe supplementary textbooks that the professor has assigned. \nBut you don't mind reading over your class notes, something \nyou know you're going to have to do anyway in the course of \npreparing for the test \nGive Yourself a Pep Talk \nPerhaps your lack of involvement is due to a lack of mo­\ntivation. In that case, taking a few minutes to build up mo­\ntivation is a good investment. \nStudies have shown that most people don't start a project \nthey believe they can't finish. Conversely, most people will at­\ntempt something that appears easy even though in fact it is \nimpossible. The basis of their willingness to try is their sub­\njective estimate of the probability of success. \nSo remember: If you feel that something will be difficult \nor impossible, the odds are that you'll not be as likely to try \nit as if you feel it is easy. But keep in mind that these are \nyour feelings. They aren't necessarily facts. Since you don't \nfor a fact know how hard something is, you'll do better to as­\nsume that it's not too difficult and that you can do it. This is \nmuch more likely to get you started on the A-l. It stands to \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LD7E 117 \nreason: If you think you're going to be successful, you'll \nwork harder on getting the A-l finished—which is why a lit­\ntle pep talk about positive attitude and self-confidence can \nmotivate you to do the A-l. lust as the coach talks to the \nfootball team at halftime, you might try telling yourself: \n\"You can do it.

(See The Real Price \nOf Delay, Chapter 19). \nMake a Commitment to Someone \nYou tell yourself, \"I'll spend an hour on this in the after­\nnoon,\" but the time comes and goes and you work on other \nmatters. But if you have actually made an appointment with \nsomeone else to discuss the subject, you're likely to keep the \nappointment and get the subject discussed, because you've \nmade a commitment to someone and don't want to let that \nperson down. I find that some clients use an appointment \nwith me as the stimulus to get going on some A-l they feel is \nimportant. They don't want to let me down, and they don't \nwant to waste the fee they're paying me. They've made a \ncommitment in self-esteem and money, and these are power­\nful stimuli indeed. \nWhat can you promise, and who is a good promisee? Well, \nyou can promise your husband to get the garden in shape in \ntime for the backyard barbeque he has arranged; promise \nyour wife, as she leaves for the office in the morning, that \nyou'll make a souffl6 for dinner tonight; promise your boss \nthat you'll have the proposal ready for his review on his return \nfrom his Toledo trip. Usually this kind of promise activates \nyour conscience sufficiently to get the A-l done. \nA deadline, though often unpleasant, also seems to force \naction. A promise to meet a deadline rather than do it \"later\" \n118 ALAN LAKEIN \nis a good inducement If friends invite you to \"get together \nsometime\" you may well want to leave things deliberately \nvague. But if you really enjoy their company, don't let them \nget away without setting a definite time for getting together. \nA meeting is a special kind of deadline. A commitment to \nbe a particular place at a specific time to discuss a particular \nsubject goes a long way to get a task moving. Your un­\nwillingness to be totally unprepared at the meeting forces \nyour hand. You do some preparation, and this represents \nmore involvement than you've mustered up to now. \nMeetings are one of the greatest time-wasters ever invent­\ned. They are almost always inefficient. Much of what is said \nat meetings is irrelevant or redundant. Little is to the point. \nBut what do you expect? If the guy who called the meeting \nknew all the answers, or could just go ahead and do what \nneeded doing, he wouldn't have called the meeting in the first \nplace. \nMost meetings come about because someone cannot do the \nA-l easily or by himself. Rather than leaving important prob­\nlems totally unattended to, the executive committee of the \nSupergiant Corporation of the membership committee of the \nYMCA gets everyone together and at least gets someone \nthinking about the A-l problem. It might be an instant task to \ncall a meeting, but it's hardly an instant task to attend it As \nI've shown, you can usually do a lot better yourself. \n16. TRY STIMULUS CHANGE TO \nKEEP INVOLVED \nONCE YOU GET INVOLVED, many tasks keep you involved \nuntil the end. You may put off cleaning up after a dinner \nparty for several hours, but once you do begin—washing the \ndishes, cleaning the ashtrays, vacuuming the rug—you perse­\nvere until the job is done. Or, having put aside a couple of \nhours of quiet time, you^spread across your desk all the ho­\ntel, airline, and rent-a-car receipts from a long business trip \nand keep at it until you have filled out all the necessary ex­\npense account forms so your office will reimburse you. \nMost tasks are sufficiently short or compelling so that even \nif you must put them aside and come back to them later, \nyour initial involvement carries you quickly back to the heart \nof the project, just as a good book pulls at you again and \nagain until you have read the last page. \nAt other times you work on a task for a while, but you \nrun out of steam short of your goal. Perhaps you've been sit­\nting at your desk working on the proposal for a new televi­\nsion documentary for an hour and a half, and can't come up \nwith another decent idea. Or you've been addressing enve­\nlopes for a charity benefit; you have to finish by 5 P.M. but \nhalfway through you just can't stand to look at another zip \ncode. \nYou know that the best use of",

You have told yourself that this is no time for pro­\ncrastination. You managed to get involved. You built up \nquite a bit of momentum. But now you're bogged down. \nHow you can possibly stay involved any longer? \nOne answer is: Always set a next step. Quite frequently, a \nproject will bog down for lack of planning the very next step. \nWhenever you are working your way through a project, \nmake clear what the next step is. Then set a time to check \nwhether you've completed that step. \n119 \n120 ALAN LAKE IN \nNo Need to Become Bored \nIt's not at all surprising that you should become bored, \nrestless, or fatigued after working on the same task for some \ntime. The yearning for change is natural. Variety is not \nmerely \"the spice of life\"; it's an essential ingredient. \nVarious experiments have been carried out in which an in­\ndividual is placed in a room with a strictly controlled envi­\nronment. His responses are monitored. In one of these exper­\niments the subject lies on a comfortable bed in total darkness \nmost of the time. All his physical needs are cared for. He \npushes a button and finds a hot meal behind a sliding panel. \nAfter five days of this, most of the test subjects reported \nhysteria, fantasies, and delusions. No subject was able to \ncontinue for more than a week, and all took many months to \nrecuperate fully. Such experiments confirm that in the ab­\nsence of what is called \"stimulus change\" a person undergoes \nrapid psychological deterioration. \nIf stimulus change is a fundamental human need, this need \nmay go back to the way our ancestors lived. The caveman's \nlife depended on his ability to detect and respond to change. \nA shift in the scent carried on the wind alerted him to the \npresence of food and the danger of predatory animals. Sur­\nvival of the fittest favored those who were most sensitive to \nstimulus change. Modern man has inherited this biological ra­\ndar. \nBut if it once was a matter of life and death to be aware \nof a sound of the advancing mammoth's footsteps, today it is \ngenerally annoying and distracting to be turned into the noise \nof strangers walking down the hall, other people's telephones \nringing, and cars passing by. \nPotentially distracting stimuli are always around although \nwhen you're very much engrossed in something, you may not \nnotice them or can ignore them. Constructive stimuli some­\ntimes need an invitation. \nNormally your need for stimulus change is satisfied by the \nevolution of the current task as one step leads to another. \nThe natural evolution of a project generates many possible \ntasks. Keeping a To Do List gives you a choice of tasks to \nprovide stimulus change. It even pays occasionally to take \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 121 \ntime to list additional steps you might take on the A-l just so \nyou have a broader range of activities to draw upon. \nIt's when the current task does not provide variety and \nchange of pace that you grow restless or bored and eagerly \naccept distraction or create it for yourself. Is there any alter­\nnative to procrastination at this point? \nSuppressing your need for change is very unlikely to be a \nsatisfactory way of staying involved in the A-l when you feel \nlike you've had enough; you can't change the biologically in­\nstilled need for stimulus change. If you're going to get con­\ntrol of your actions, your opportunity comes in providing the \nright stimulus change. \nRest Breaks and Work Breaks \nOne thing you can do is take a rest break. Get up and \nstretch, walk to the water cooler, socialize, then continue on \nthe A-l for another hour or two. \nYou can also take a work break. Any other task will do, \nbut another A is always preferable if it will mean a change \nof pace from the work you were just involved in. If you've \nbeen addressing envelopes, make an appointment with your \nhairdresser, go over your dinner menu, wash the breakfast \ndishes, or visit with the woman next door. Then, after a few \nminutes, go back and continue the A-l. \nOften the break is all you need. But what do you do if \nyou're working against a deadline and every minute counts? \nOr if you tried a coffee break ten minutes ago and you're al",

Even if you're send­\ning out Christmas cards, sewing name tapes on camp clothes, \nor coding inventory sheets, if you look you will find ways \nto vary such tasks and satisfy your need for stimulus change \nwithout running away to some other activity. \nThe real payoff in using this technique comes when you're \n122 ALAN LAKE IN \nhaving trouble staying involved in a multifaeeted project, ,like \nwriting a magazine article, developing a study proposal for \nthe League of Women Voters, figuring out how to respond to \na competitor's new product, or researching ways to recycle \nused plasterboard. To keep from procrastinating when you \nget bogged down in a swampy part of the forest, you need to \nget hooked on some new aspect of the project. You need \nfresh bait for fresh involvement. \nAs I showed in the section on instant tasks, there are many \nways to move your project ahead. You can plan, talk to oth­\ners, give yourself a pep talk, gather information, write down \nsome notes. Naturally, some projects have more built-in vari­\nety than others. But there are always at least some opportu­\nnities for change within each project. \nTry changing your location. Sometimes new surroundings \ncan do wonders to refresh a tired mind. If you've been work­\ning at your desk, try the conference room. If you've been \nreading in the living room, try the bedroom. Or stay where \nyou are but change your position. If you have been sitting \ndown, try standing on your head. \nWhat works best is to change the way you're going about \nthe task. Any intellectual effort contains elements that can be \njuggled. You need information and ideas. These have to be \ncollected, digested, and acted upon. You can shift back and \nforth between working on information and ideas, or switch \nfrom collecting to digesting to action. \nNot Enough Information—or Too Mnch? \nLet's begin with information collection. Earlier I discussed \nthe idea of getting more information as a way to get in­\nvolved. You will recall that the level of your interest gener­\nally increases as you move from no information to some \ninformation. So when you need to keep involved in a project, \npick an area where you have little or no information and in­\ncrease your- knowledge. \nBut suppose your problem is the very opposite. Many \npeople get bogged down in the middle of a project because \nthey have so much information that they feel overwhelmed. \nOr they have too many ideas (even too many good ones). \nThere is an optimum level of knowledge of course (it varies \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LD7E 123 \nfor different projects and for different people). Either too \nmuch or too little leads to a decrease in interest and involve­\nment. \nSo if you are tired of collecting information or ideas, proc­\ness what you have. Consider each item; then file it, condense \nit, throw it out, organize it A particularly helpful step, if \nyou've been gathering knowledge from books or other people \nor your own head, is to write something down. Even if it is \nno good for final use, it gives you something fresh to react \nto, or to show others to get their reactions. \nThe Cushion That Never Got Made \nMs. Gill had long wanted to make a needlepoint cushion \nfor a favorite chair. She kept putting it off, because there \nseemed to be so many details to work out before she could \neven begin to think of putting needle to canvas. Finally, \nwisely realizing she would have to start somewhere if she was \ngoing to get on with it, she went shopping for materials. She \nspent several weeks looking for the perfect pattern and yarns. \nA saleslady at one store talked her into taking a month-long \nintensive course on the history and technology of needlepoint. \nHaving completed the course, she decided that the only way \nto have yarns of the precise colors she wanted was to get \nthem from a mail-order house. This led to a six-week delay \n",

It must \nlead you toward the completion of the A-l. If Ms. Gill's A-l \nwas to turn loose her curiosity about needlepoint and follow \nwherever it led, then she accomplished her A-l in fine style. \nBut if it was to make a new cushion for her chair, then she \ncertainly went astray. \nAny major project, such as adding a new wing to your \nhouse, or introducing an important new procedure in your \noffice, is a prolonged effort that requires continuing involve­\nment at many stages. This takes large blocks of time. \nFirst schedule the time needed to work on the project: \nThen when the time comes use the ideas in this chapter to \nkeep involved. \n17. SOMETIMES IT PAYS TO SLOW DOWN \nIN SOME SITUATIONS, such techniques as instant tasks and \nstimulus change will not halt procrastination, because you \nharbor a too-active dislike or distaste for the A-l. Talking to \nyour child's teacher about a bad grade, seeing the doctor for \nan annual checkup, asking the bank for a loan, drawing up a \nnew will, going for a job interview—these are all examples of \nimportant but unpleasant tasks that many people put off. You \nprobably include them when you plan, and underscore their \nimportance by assigning them an A-priority. But when the \ntime comes to follow through, the task looms up larger than \nlife in all its unpleasantness, and you hastily turn to some \nother activity instead. \nA decision to turn from an unpleasant A-l to a more \npleasant task gets far less time and rational consideration \nthan it deserves. Typically, such a decision is made quickly, \noften in a matter of a few seconds. \nSuppose you take out a letter you should answer now. \nWriting a reply is your A-l, but since it involves admitting an \nembarrassing mistake you find the task distasteful. You lay \nthe letter aside for the third time this week and pick up a \nmagazine instead. Soon you're absorbed in an interesting arti­\ncle, and have forgotten all about the unpleasant letter. The \nsequence of steps that led to your procrastinating on the A-l \ntook no more than fifteen seconds. \nLet's back up and look at that decision more closely. You \nalready had a clearly identified A-l. The next step was to do \nit But you hesitated. In essence, you had two choices at this \npoint. You could. \n(1) do the A-l, thereby making the best use of your time; \n(2) do something else, thereby wasting your time. \nTrue, you got some value out of the activity you turned to \ninstead of the A-l, but since the A-l was the best use of your \ntime, the other activity was a comparative waste of time. \n125 \n126 ALAN LAKEIN \nWhat can you do when you have no doubt that you should \ndo the unpleasant A-l, yet are strongly inclined to run away \nfrom it and turn to something else? \nFirst, you must recognize clearly when you have reached \nsuch a pivotal point You're at Decision Time when you're at \nthe point of choosing whether to do the A-l now or to avoid \nit. It is somewhat like being at the top of a mountain. There \nare two paths leading down the mountain, one to the north \nand one to",

Once you've decided to do a task, you may as well do \nthe best you can and try to enjoy yourself. \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LD7E 127 \nIf you sense you're about to avoid the A-l and do some­\nthing else instead, tell yourself quite emphatically that you're \nat Decision Time. Remind yourself what an important time it \nis. Caution yourself to slow down. Now use these three ways \nto help you overcome your distaste for the A-l: \n(1) Deal with the unpleasantness directly. \n(2) Recognize the greater unpleasantness that results from \ndelay. \n(3) Create enthusiasm that counterbalances the unpleas­\nantness. \nI'll deal with each of these in detail. Once you have all \nthree in your toolkit, you can use whichever seems most ap­\npropriate to give you the extra push you need at Decision \nTime for doing the A-l now. \n18. DON'T LET FEAR GET IN YOUR WAY \nHow MANY, TIMES have you avoided doing something im­\nportant because you were afraid of making a mistake? Or \ngetting angry? Or feeling guilty? Or hurting yourself or oth­\ners? Or being rejected? Or taking on too much responsibility? \nOr confronting the unknown? Lots of times, I'm sure. \nI'm not a psychiatrist, so it would be presumptuous of me \nto make any diagnosis, especially at long distance, of any­\none's particular emotional hang-up. The techniques I discuss \nin mis chapter work in a bypass fashion; they are not intend­\ned to cure anyone of any particular emotional problem, but \nto allow him to function while he either works his problem \nout himself or gets professional help. \nm deal primarily with fear, because my conversations with \npsychiatrists and psychologists have convinced me that fear is \nat the root of all avoidance. If you can conquer your fear, \nyou can do that unpleasant A-l. \nI have encountered many cases of people avoiding a task \nto which they have assigned a high priority because subcon­\nsciously they feared the consequences that would follow once \nthe task was completed. \nThe sales executive mentioned earlier kept procrastinating \non his A-l of trying to sell a new account because of his fear \nof adding further to his workload if he were successful. His \nfear needed to be allayed by clearing away some of bis other \nwork; only then did he stop avoiding his high-priority A and \ngo after that big account \nA supervisor was asked to develop a procedure manual for",

The way to do \nthis is to slow down the final decision. A quick decision to \nput the unpleasant A-l out of sight and mind gives you little \nchance to curb your tendency to procrastinate. Take enough \ntime to consider the situation carefully. Give yourself every \nopportunity not to ditch the A-l for some activity of lesser \nvalue. Slow down the process so that you have time to make \na conscious and deliberate choice. \nTake the case of the unanswered letter.

Finally he realized he was procrastinating out of \nfear that if he finished the procedure manual, he might even-\n128 \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 129 \ntually be out of a job. He would no longer be indispensable. \nHis real A-l was a talk with his boss to clarify what his \nstatus would be once the job on the manual was done. \nDon't let your emotions do you in. If you suspect you are \navoiding the A-l because of some fear, then at Decision Time \nask yourself, \"What am I afraid of?\" Make a list of possibili­\nties and single out the fear that is most likely causing the \navoidance. Then confront that fear head on. How? Take the \ncase of Mr. Blue. \nMr. Blue was a sales representative for an industrial-prod­\nucts firm. He knew that the best use of his time was to \ndevelop contacts with as many new purchasing agents as pos­\nsible. Nevertheless, he always stretched out his visits to those \nagents who were old friends, even though many of them \ncould repay him only in talk and not in profit. He avoided \nmaking calls on new agents, because they occasionally reject­\ned him or treated him rudely. \nNow Mr. Blue had prepared an annual sales plan. It \nrightly emphasized new agent contacts, but from the very \nfirst day he tried to implement the plan, he found himself \nrunning away. His fear of feeling rejected was clearly pre­\nventing him from following through on his wonderful plan. \nDetermined to find some solution to his dilemma, Mr. Blue \ndecided to focus on one particular goal—to see the purchas­\ning agent from the Ajax Company. He'd long wanted to go \nafter the Ajax account The chance of actually closing this \nsale was truly exciting. But he was scared that the agent \nmight turn him down with some devastating comment and \nthen he would be worse off than before. \nHow to Extinguish Fear \nAs he contemplated the telephone call to the Ajax agent \nand felt fear holding him back, Mr. Blue told himself that \nbeing afraid was silly; that there was nothing to worry about; \nthat he had more important things to do than worrying. In \neffect he said to his fear, \"Go away, you're bothering me.\" \nThis had often helped him over the hump he confronted be­\nfore making a call to a new agent but since he had particu­\nlarly strong feelings about this agent his pep talk was not a \nsufficient antidote. \n130 ALAN LAKEIN \nIf Mr. Blue's fear had been at a low-enough level—of \ncampfire rather than forest fire proportions—then it could \nprobably have been easily extinguished. But with an out-of-\ncontrol fear, a really threatening emotion, such a solution \nrarely works. Indeed Mr. Blue's current predicament was \nsuch that when he told himself, \"There's nothing to fear,\" it \nonly made matters worse. Not only was he afraid; he was \nafraid that he was afraid when he shouldn't be afraid! He \ncertainly had to find some other way of handling his fear of \nbeing rejected by the Ajax agent. \nHow to Contain Fear \nA small fire can easily be put out with a little water, but if \na fire is raging uncontrollably, it's best to contain it, to create \nboundaries and then in effect say to the fire, \"You can burn \nall you want inside this circle, but you may not cross this \nline!\" \nMr. Blue found that although he could not extinguish his \nfear, he was able to contain it, at least for the moment. He \nrealized that he might not even get to talk to the feared \nagent, but only to his secretary. Anyway, he thought he'd be \nable to survive a quick, clean \"No\" over the telephone. If he \ndid succeed in making an appointment, there would be plenty \nto worry about, so he would give himself lots of time to in­\ndulge his fears—but only after he made the call. \nAt this point Mr. Blue recalled the character Major Major \nin the novel Catch-22, who announced that he was not to be \ndisturbed when he was in",

The idea behind judo, \nhe knew, is to use your opponent's own strength and weight \nagainst him, thereby turning potential defeat into victory. \nMr. Blue's fear was coming at him with great force and ef­\nfect.

I really don't \nknow much about the Ajax Company or how they can best \nuse my products ...\" \nJUDO: \"... if thafs the case, then I better put some time \ninto finding out more about Ajax right away.\" \nFEAR: \"Then there are all those questions I know hell \nask...\" \nJUDO: m. . . and instead of worrying about being ill-\nprepared, I had better try to anticipate his questions and dig \nup the answers right now.\" \nWith his energy more positively channeled, Mr. Blue \ngulped down the last of his coffee and started to research the \nAjax account. Everytime something unpleasant about the up­\ncoming interview occurred to him, he \"judoed\" it. When he \nthought of a terrible mistake he might make, he made a \nmental note not to let that happen. His fear actually spurred \nhim on, since he realized that only conscientious work might \nsave him. There was no procrastinating the rest of Friday; he \nwanted to be sure he was prepared. \nMonday afternoon, on the way over to the Ajax Company, \n132 ALAN LAKE IN \nhe started worrying again.

After all, this \nwas it! If ever there was a good time to be afraid, it was \nnow. Mr. Blue realized that his only chance was to give in to \nhis fears completely and hope that they would burn them­\nselves out before it was too late. \nAs he got into the elevator, he asked himself, \"What's the \nworst thing that could possibly happen to me as a result of \nthis visit?\" Perhaps the agent would call his boss and tell him \nthat Mr. Blue was incompetent. Perhaps he would tell all his \nfriends Mr. Blue was an idiot and they should never do busi­\nness with him. \nGetting warmed up, Mr. Blue began to balloon his fears \neven more. His fantasies were easily the equal of Walter \nMitty's. Perhaps the agent would organize a boycott of Mr. \nBlue's products. Perhaps the agent would start a smear cam­\npaign against him and he would be spurned everywhere by \neveryone. With no safe territory left, Mr. Blue pictured",

This change in attitude \ndid not happen right away; in fact, it took Mr. Blue two \nyears to reduce his fear of rejection to an occasional twinge. \nI should point out that Mr. Blue has behaved as all good \nexamples in books behave—he has managed to exhibit a \nnumber of problems in dealing with fear, and he has bene­\nfited from all the techniques I suggested using. \n",
