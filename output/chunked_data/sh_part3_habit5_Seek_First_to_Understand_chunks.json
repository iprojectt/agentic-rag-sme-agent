This \nprinciple is the key to effective interpersonal communication.  Character and Communication     Right now, you're reading a book I've wri tten.  Reading and writing are both forms of \ncommunication.  So are speaking and listening.  In fact, those are the four basic types of \ncommunication.  And think of all the hours you spen d doing at least one of those four things.  The \nability to do them well is absolutely  critical to your effectiveness. \n   Communication is the most important skill in life.  We spend most  of our waking hours \ncommunicating.  But consider this: You've spent years  learning how to read and write, years learning \nhow to speak.  But what about listening?  What t raining or education have you had that enables you \nto listen so that you really, deeply understand an other human being from that individual's own frame \nof reference?    Comparatively few people have had any training in  listening at all.  And, for the most part, their \ntraining has been in the personality ethic of te chnique, truncated from the character base and the \nrelationship base absolutely vital to au thentic understanding of another person. \n   If you want to interact effectively with me, to in fluence me -- your spouse, yo ur child, your neighbor, \nyour boss, your coworker, your friend -- you first n eed to understand me.  And you can't do that with \ntechnique alone.  If I sense you're using some tec hnique, I sense duplicity, manipulation.  I wonder \nwhy you're doing it, what your motives are.  And I don' t feel safe enough to open myself up to you. \n   The real key to your influence with me is your example, your actual conduct.  Your example flows naturally out of your character, of th e kind of person you truly are --  not what others say you are or \nwhat you may want me to think you are.  It is  evident in how I actually experience you. \n   Your character is constantly radiating, communi cating.  From it, in the long run, I come to \ninstinctively trust or distrust you and your efforts with me.    If your life runs hot and cold , if you're both caustic and kind, and, above all, if your private \nperformance doesn't square with your public performance, it's very hard for me to open up with you.  \nThen, as much as I may want and even  need to receive your love and in fluence, I don't feel safe enough \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \nto expose my opinions and experiences and my tender feelings.  Who knows what will happen? \n   But unless I open up with you,  unless you understand me and my unique situation and feelings, you \nwon't know how to advise or counsel me.  What you say is good and fine, but it doesn't quite pertain to me.    You may say you care about and appreciate me.  I desperately want to believe that.

But how can \nyou appreciate me when you don't even understand me?  All I have are your words, and I can't trust \nwords.    I'm too angry and defensive -- perhaps too guilty an d afraid -- to be influenced, even though inside I \nknow I need what you could tell me.    Unless you're influenced by my uniqueness, I'm no t going to be influenced by your advice.  So if \nyou want to be really effective in the habit of interpersonal communication, you cannot do it with technique alone.  You have to build the skills of empa thic listening on a base of character that inspires \nopenness and trust.  And you have to build the Em otional Bank Accounts that create a commerce \nbetween hearts.  Empathic Listening     \"Seek first to understand\" involves a very deep shift in paradigm.

You \nlisten with reflective skills, but you listen with intent to reply, to control, to manipulate. \n   When I say empathic listening, I mean listening with in tent to understand.  I mean seeking first to \nunderstand, to really understand.  It's an entirely different paradigm.    Empathic (from empathy) listening gets inside another person's frame of reference.  You look out \nthrough it, you see the world the way they see the world, you understand their paradigm, you \nunderstand how they feel.    Empathy is not sympathy.  Sympathy is a form  of agreement, a form of judgment.  And it is \nsometimes the more appropriate emotion and respon se.  But people often feed on sympathy.  It \nmakes them dependent.  The essence of empathic listeni ng is not that you agree with someone; it's that \nyou fully, deeply, understand that person , emotionally as well as intellectually. \n   Empathic listening in volves much more than registering, reflecting, or even understanding the \nwords that are said.  Communications experts es timate, in fact, that only 10 percent of our \ncommunication is represented by the words we say.  Another 30 percent is represented by our sounds, \nand 60 percent by our body language.  In empathic listening, you listen with your ears, but you also, \nand more importantly, listen with your eyes and with  your heart.  You listen for feeling, for meaning.  \nYou listen for behavior.  You use your right brain as well as your left.  You sense, you intuit, you feel. \n   Empathic listening is so powerful because it gives you accurate data to work with.  Instead of \nprojecting your own autobiography and assuming thou ght, feelings, motives, and interpretation, you're \ndealing with the reality inside another person's head and heart.

Empathic listening is, in and of itself, a tremendous deposit in the Emotional Bank Account.  It's \ndeeply therapeutic and healing because it gives a person \"psychological air.    If all the air were suddenly sucked out of the r oom you're in right now, what would happen to your \ninterest in this book?  You wouldn't care about the book; you wouldn't care about anything except \ngetting air.  Survival would be your only motivation.    But now that you have air, it doesn't motivate you.  This is one of the greatest insights in the field of \nhuman motivations: Satisfied needs do not motivate.  It's only the unsatisfied need that motivates.  \nNext to physical survival, the greatest need of a human being is psychological survival -- to be understood, to be affirmed, to be validated, to be appreciated.    When you listen with empathy to another pers on, you give that person psychological air.  And \nafter that vital need is met, you can then  focus on influencing or problem solving. \n   This need for psychological air impa cts communication in every area of life. \n   I taught this concept at a seminar in Chicago on e time, and I instructed the participants to practice \nempathic listening during the evening.  The next mo rning, a man came up to me almost bursting with \nnews.    \"Let me tell you what happened last night,\" he said.  \"I was trying to close a big commercial real \nestate deal while I was here in Chicago.

I panicked.  I did \neverything I could -- I pulled out all the stops -- I used every sales technique I could.  The final stop was to say, 'Could we delay this decision just a little longer?'  But the momentum was so strong and \nthey were so disgusted by having this thing go on so long, it was obvious they were going to close. \n   \"So I said to myself, 'Well, why not try it?  Wh y not practice what I learned today and seek first to \nunderstand, then to be understood?  I've got nothing to lose.'    \" I  j u s t  s a i d  t o  t h e  m a n ,  ' L e t  m e  s e e  i f  I  r e a l l y  u n d e r s t a n d  w h a t  y o u r  p o s i t i o n  i s  a n d  w h a t  y o u r  concerns about my recommendations really are.  Wh en you feel I understand them, then we'll see \nwhether my proposal has any relevance or not.'    \"I really tried to put myself in his shoes.  I tried to verbalize his needs and concerns, and he began \nto open up.    \"The more I sensed and expressed the things he  was worried about, the results he anticipated, the \nmore he opened up.    \"Finally, in the middle of our conversation, he stood up, walked over to the phone, and dialed his \nwife.  Putting his hand over the mouthp iece, he said, 'You've got the deal.' \n   \"I was totally dumbfounded,\" he told me.  \"I still am this morning.    He had made a huge deposit in the Emotional Bank Account by giving the man psychological air.  \nWhen it comes right down to it, other things be ing relatively equal, the human dynamic is more \nimportant than the technical dimensions of the deal.    Seeking first to understand, diagnosing before yo u prescribe, is hard.  It's so much easier in the \nshort run to hand someone a pair of glasses that have fit you so well these many years. \n   But in the long run, it severely deplet es both P and PC.  You can't achieve maximum \ninterdependent production from an inaccurate unders tanding of where other people are coming from.  \nAnd you can't have interpersonal PC -- high Emotional Bank Accounts -- if the people you relate with \ndon't really feel understood.    Empathic listening is also risky.  It takes a great deal of security to go into a deep listening \nexperience because you open yourself  up to be influenced.  You become vulnerable.  It's a paradox, in \na sense, because in order to have influence, you have  to be influenced.  That means you have to really \nunderstand.    That's why Habits 1, 2, and 3 are so foundation al.  They give you the changeless inner core, the \nprinciple center, from which you can handle the mo re outward vulnerability with peace and strength. \n Diagnose Before You Prescribe     Although it's risky and hard, s eek first to understand, or diagnose before you prescribe, is a correct \nprinciple manifesting many areas of lif e.  It's the mark of all true prof essionals.  It's critical for the \noptometrist, it's critical for the physician.

I'll call in a prescription.  Which is your \npharmacy?\"    When she hung up, Sandra felt that in her rush she hadn't really given him full data, but that what \nshe had told him was adequate.    \"Do you think he realizes that Jenny is just a newborn?\" I asked her \n   \"I'm sure he does,\" Sandra replied.    \"But he's not our doctor.  He's never even treated her.\"    \"Well, I'm pretty sure he knows.\"    \"Are you willing to give her the medicine  unless you're absolutely sure he knows?\" \n   Sandra was silent.  \"What are we going to do?\" she finally said. \n   \"Call him back,\" I said.    \"You call him back,\" Sandra replied.    So I did.  He was paged out of the game once again.  \"Doctor,\" I said, \"when you called in that prescription, did  your realize that Jenny is just two months old?\"    \"No!\" he exclaimed.  \"I didn't realize that .  It's good you called me back.  I'll change the \nprescription immediately.\"    If you don't have confidence in the diagnosi s, you won't have confidence in the prescription. \n   This principle is also true in sales.  An effect ive salesperson first seeks to understand the needs, the \nconcerns, the situation of the customer.  The amateu r salesman sells products; the professional sells \nsolutions to needs and problems.  It's a totally di fferent approach.  The professional learns how to \ndiagnose, how to understand.  He also learns how to re late people's needs to his products and services.  \nAnd, he has to have the integrity to say, \"My produc t or service will not meet that need\" if it will not. \n   Diagnosing before you prescribe is also fundamen tal to law.  The professional lawyer first gathers \nthe facts to understand the situation, to understand  the laws and precedents, before preparing a case.  \nA good lawyer almost writes the opposing a ttorney's case before he writes his own. \n   It's also true in product design.  Can you imagine someone in a compan y saying, \"This consumer \nresearch stuff is for the birds.  Let's design produc ts.\"  In other words, forget understanding the \nconsumer's buying habits and motives -- just  design products.  It would never work. \n   A good engineer will understand the forces, th e stresses at work, before designing the bridge.  A \ngood teacher will assess the class before teaching.  A good student will understand before he applies.  \nA good parent will understand before evaluation  or judging.  The key to good judgment is \nunderstanding.  By judging first, a person will never fully understand. \n   Seek first to understand is a correct principl e evident in all areas of life.  It's a generic, \ncommon-denominator principle, but it has its greate st power in the area of interpersonal relations. \n Four Autobiographical Responses     Because we listen autobiographically, we tend to respond in one of four ways.

You can play 20 question s all day and not find out what's important to \nsomeone.  Constant probing is one of the main re asons parents do not get close to their children. \n   \"How's it going, son?\"    \" F i n e . \"     \"Well, what's been happening lately?\"    \"Nothing.\"    \"So what's exciting at school?\"    \" N o t  m u c h . \"     \"And what are your plans for the weekend?\"    \"I don't know.\"    You can't get him off the phone talking with his friends, but all he gives you is one- and two-word \nanswers.  Your house is a motel where he eats and sleeps, but he never shares, never opens up.    And when you think about it, honestly, why shou ld he, if every time he does open up his soft \nunderbelly, you elephant stomp it with auto biographical advice and \"I told you so's.\" \n   We are so deeply scripted in these responses th at we don't even realize when we use them.  I have \ntaught this concept to thousands of people in semi nars across the country, and it never fails to shock \nthem deeply as we role-play empathic listening situat ions and they finally begin to listen to their own \ntypical responses.  But as they begin to see how they normally respond and learn how to listen with \nempathy, they can see the dramatic results in comm unication.  To many, seek first to understand \nbecomes the most exciting, the most immedi ately applicable, of all the Seven Habits. \n   Let's take a look at what well might be a typ ical communication between a father and his teenage \nson.  Look at the father's words in terms of th e four different responses we have just described. \n   \"Boy, Dad, I've had it!  School is for the birds!\"    \"What's the matter, Son?\" (probing).    \"It's totally impractical.  I don't get a thing out of  it.\"    \"Well, you just can't see the benefits yet, So n.  I felt the same way when I was your age.\"  I \nremember thinking what a waste some  of the classes were.  But those classes turned out to be the most \nhelpful to me later on.  Just hang in there.  Give it some time\" (advising).    \"I've given it 10 years of  my lif e!  Can you tell me what  good 'x pl us y' is going to be to me as an \nauto mechanic?\"    \"An auto mechanic?  You've got to be kidding\" (evaluating).    \"No, I'm not.  Look at Joe.  He's quit school.  He's working on cars.  And he's making lots of money.  Now that's practical.\"    \"It may look that way now.  But several years down the road, Joe's going to wish he'd stayed in \nschool.  You don't want to be an auto mechanic.  You need an educ ation to prepare you for something \nbetter than that\" (advising).    \"I don't know.  Joe's got a pretty good set-up.\"    \"Look, Son, have you really tried?\" (probing, evaluating).    \"I've been in high school  two years now.  Sure I've tried.  It's just a waste.\" \n   \"That's a highly respected school, Son.  Give them a little credit\" (advising, evaluating).    \"Well, the other guys feel the same way I do.\"    \"Do you realize how many sacrifices your moth er and I have made to get you to where you are?  \nYou can't quit when you've come this far\" (evaluating).    \"I know you've sacrificed, Dad.  But it's just not worth it.\"    \"Look, maybe if you spent more time doing your homework and less time in front of TV.\" (advising, \nevaluating).    \"Look, Dad.  It's just no good.  Oh, never mind!  I don't want to talk about this anyway.\"",

I was dumb to try.) \n   \"Look, Dad.  It's just no good.  Oh, never mind!  I don't want to talk about this anyway.\" \n   Can you see how limited we are when we try to understand another person  on the basis of words \nalone, especially when we're lo oking at that person through ou r own glasses?  Can you see how \nlimiting our autobiographical responses are to a person who is genuinely trying to get us to understand \nhis autobiography?    You will never be able to truly step inside anot her person, to see the world as he sees it, until you \ndevelop the pure desire, the stren gth of personal character, and the positive Emotional Bank Account, \nas well as the empathic listening skills to do it.    The skills, the tip of the iceberg of empath ic listening, involve four developmental stages \n   The first and least effective is to mimic content.  This is the skill taught in \"active\" or \"reflective\" \nlistening.  Without the character and relationship base, it is often insulting to people and causes them \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \nto close up.  It is, however, a first-stage skill because it  at least causes you to listen to what's being said \n   Mimicking content is easy.  You just listen to the words that come out of  someone's mouth and you \nrepeat them.  You're hardly even using your brain at all    \"Boy, Dad, I've had it!  School is for the birds!\"    \"You've had it.  You think school is for the birds.\"    You have essentially repeated back the content of what was being said.  You haven't evaluated or \nprobed or advised or interpreted.  You've at least showed you're paying attention to his words.  But \nto understand, you want to do more.    The second stage of empathic listening is to rephras e the content.  It's a little more effective, but it's \nstill limited to the verbal communication    \"Boy, Dad, I've had it!  School is for the birds!\"    \"You don't want to go to school anymore.\"    This time, you've put his meaning into your ow n words.  Now you're thinking about what he said, \nmostly with the left side, the reas oning, logical side of the brain. \n   The third stage brings your right brain into operation.  You reflect feeling.    \"Boy, Dad, I've had it!  School is for the birds!\"    \"You're feeling really frustrated.\"    Now you're not paying as much attention to what he's saying as you are to the way he feels about what he's saying.  The fourth stage includes both the second and the third.  You rephrase the content \nand reflect the feeling.    \"Boy, Dad, I've had it!  School is for the birds!\"    \"You're really frustrated about school.\"    Frustration is the feeling; school is the content.  You're using both sides of your brain to understand \nboth sides of his communication.    Now, what happens when you us e fourth stage empathic listening sk ills is really incredible.  As \nyou authentically seek to understand, as you re phrase content and reflect feeling, you give him \npsychological air.  You also help him work through his own thoughts and feelings.  As he grows in \nhis confidence of your sincere desire to really lis ten and understand, the barrier between what's going \non inside him and what's actually being communicated to you disappears.  It opens a soul-to-soul flow.  \nHe's not thinking and feeling one thing and communica ting another.  He begins to trust you with his \ninnermost tender feelings and thoughts.    \"Boy, Dad, I've  had it!  School is for the birds!\"  (I want to talk with you to get your attention.)    \"You're really frustrated about school.\"   (That's right!  That's how I feel.) \n   \"I sure am.  It's totally impractica l.  I'm not getting a thing out of it.\" \n   \"You feel like school's not doing you any good .\"  (Let me think -- is that what I mean?) \n   \"",

Fourth grade!  \nAnd I'm in junior high school!\"    What a difference real understanding can make !  All the well-meaning advice in the world won't \namount to a hill of beans if we're  not even addressing the real problem.  And we'll never get to the \nproblem if we're so caught up in our own autobi ography, our own paradigms, that we don't take off \nour glasses long enough to see the world from another point of view.    \"I'm going to flunk, Dad.

You're in the middle of a dilemma.\"    \"What do you think I should do, Dad?\"    By seeking first to understand, this father has just turned a transact ional opportunity into a \ntransformational opportunity.  Instead of interacting on a surf ace, get-the-job-done level of \ncommunication, he has created a situ ation in which he can now have transforming impact, not only on \nhis son but also on the relationsh ip.  By setting aside his own auto biography and really seeking to \nunderstand, he has made a tremendous deposit in the Emotional Bank Account and has empowered his \nson to open, layer upon layer, and to get to the real issue.    Now father and son are on the same side of the table looking at the problem, instead of on opposite \nsides looking across at each other.  The son is op ening his father's autobiography and asking for \nadvice.    Even as the father begins to counsel, however, he needs to be sensitive to his son's communication.  \nAs long as the response is logical, the father can effectively ask questions an d give counsel.  But the \nmoment the response becomes emotional, he needs to go back to empathic listening. \n   \"Well, I can see some things  you might want to consider.\" \n   \"Like what, Dad?\"    \"Like getting some special help with your re ading.  Maybe they have some kind of tutoring \nprogram over at the tech school.\"    \"I've already checked into that.  It takes two nights and all day Saturday.  That would take so much time!\"    Sensing emotion in that reply, the father moves back to empathy. \n   \"That's too much of a price to pay.\"    \"Besides, Dad, I told the sixth graders I'd be their coach.\"    \"You don't want to let them down.\"    \"But I'll tell you this, Dad.

He's  opening his father's auto biography again.  Now the \nfather has another opportunity to influence and transform. \n   There are times when transformation requires no  outside counsel.  Often when people are really \ngiven the chance to open up, they  unravel their own problems and the solutions become clear to them \nin the process.    At other times, they really need additional pe rspective and help.  The key is to genuinely seek the \nwelfare of the individual, to listen with empathy, to let the person get to the pr oblem and the solution at \nhis own pace and time.  Layer upon layer -- it's lik e peeling an onion until you get to the soft inner \ncore.  \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n   When people are really hurting and you really listen with a pure desire  to understand, you'll be \namazed how fast they will open up.  They want to open up.  Children desperately want to open up, \neven more to their parents than to their peers.  And they will, if they feel their parents will love them \nunconditionally and will be faithful to them afterwards and not judge or ridicule them. \n   If you really seek to understand, without hypo crisy and without guile, there will be times when you \nwill be literally stunned with the pure knowledge and understanding that will flow to you from another \nhuman being.  It isn't even always necessary to talk  in order to empathize.  In fact, sometimes words \nmay just get in your way.  That's one very import ant reason why technique alone will not work.  That \nkind of understanding transcends technique.  Isolated technique only gets in the way. \n   I have gone through the skills of  empathic listening because skill is an important part of any habit.  \nWe need to have the skills.  But let me reiterate th at the skills will not be effective unless they come \nfrom a sincere desire to understand.  People resent any attempt to manipulate them.  In fact, if you're \ndealing with people you're close to, it's helpful to tell them what you're doing. \n   \"I read this book about listening and empathy and I thought about my rela tionship with you.  I \nrealized I haven't listened to you like I should.  But I wa nt to.  It's hard for me.  I may blow it at times, \nbut I'm going to work at it.  I really care about you and I want to understand.  I hope you'll help me.\"  \nAffirming your motive is a huge deposit.    But if you're not sincere, I wouldn't even try it .  It may create an openness and a vulnerability that \nwill later turn to your harm when a person discovers that you really didn't care, you really didn't want \nto listen, and he's left open, exposed, and hurt.  The technique, the tip of the ic eberg, has to come out of \nthe massive base of character underneath.    Now there are people who protest that empathic listening takes too much time.  It may take a little \nmore time initially but it saves so much time do wnstream.  The most effici ent thing you can do if \nyou're a doctor and want to prescribe a wise treatment is to make an accurate di agnosis.  You can't say, \n\"I'm in too much of a hurry.  I don't have time to make a diagnosis.  Just take this treatment.\" \n   I remember writing one time in a room on th e north shore of Oahu, Hawaii.  There was a soft \nbreeze blowing, and so I had opened  two windows -- one at the front an d one at the side -- to keep the \nroom cool.  I had a number of papers laid out, chapter by chapter, on a large table.    Suddenly, the breeze started picking up and bl owing my papers about.

And whatever in vestment of time it takes to do that will bring \nmuch greater returns of time as you work from an  accurate understanding of the problems and issues \nand from the high Emotional Bank Account that results when a person feels deeply understood. \n Understanding and Perception     As you learn to listen deeply to other pe ople, you will discover tremendous differences in \nperception.

And ye t we both have lived with our paradigms for years, \nthinking they are \"facts,\" and questioning the charac ter or the mental competence of anyone who can't \n\"see the facts.\"    Now, with all our differences, we're trying to  work together -- in a m arriage, in a job, in a \ncommunity service project -- to manage resources and accomplish results.  So how do we do it?  How \ndo we transcend the limits of our in dividual perceptions so that we ca n deeply communicate, so that we \ncan cooperatively deal with the issues  and come up with win-win solutions? \n   The answer is Habit 5.  It's the first step in th e process of win-win.  Even if (and especially when) \nthe other person is not coming from th at paradigm, seek first to understand. \n   This principle worked powerfully for one exec utive who shared with me the following experience. \n   \"I was working with a small company that was in  the process of negotiating a contract with a large \nnational banking institution.  This institution flew in their lawyers from San Francisco, their negotiator \nfrom Ohio, and presidents of two of  their large banks to create an eight-person negotiating team.  The \ncompany I worked with had decided to go for Win- Win or No Deal.  They wanted to significantly \nincrease the level of service and the cost, but they  had been almost overwhelmed with the demands of \nthis large financial institution.    \"The president of our compan y sat across the negotiating table and told them, 'We would like for \nyou to write the contract the way you want it so that we can make sure we un derstand your needs and \nyour concerns.  We will respond to those needs and concerns.  Then we can talk about pricing.' \n   \"The members of the negotiating team were ov erwhelmed.  They were astounded that they were \ngoing to have the opportunity to write the contract.  They took three days to come up with the idea. \n   \"When they presented it, the president said, 'Now  let's make sure we understand what you want.'  \nAnd he went down the contract, rephrasing the conten t, reflecting the feeling, until he was sure and \nthey were sure he understood what was important to th em.  'Yes.  That's right.  No",

Finally, I realized it would be better to \ntake 10 seconds and close one of the windows.    Empathic listening takes time, bu t it doesn't take anywhere near as much time as it takes to back up \nand correct misunderstandings when you're alread y miles down the road, to redo, to live with \nunexpressed  and unsolved problems, to deal with the results of not giving people psychological air. \n   A discerning empathic listener can read what's  happening down deep fast, and can show such \nacceptance, such understanding, that other people feel safe to open up layer after layer until they get to \nthat soft inner core where the problem really lies.    People want to be understood.  And whatever in vestment of time it takes to do that will bring \nmuch greater returns of time as you work from an  accurate understanding of the problems and issues",

Ethos is your personal credibility, the faith peop le have in your integrity and competency.  It's the \ntrust that you inspire, your Emotional Bank Account.  Pathos is the empathic side -- it's the feeling.  It \nmeans that you are in alignment with the emotional tr ust of another person's communication.

This represents anothe r major Paradigm Shift.  Most people, in making \npresentations, go straight to the logos, the left-brain logic, of their ideas.  They try to convince other \npeople of the validity of that logic without firs t taking ethos and pathos into consideration. \n   I had an acquaintance who was very frustrated be cause his boss was locked in to what he felt was an \nunproductive leadership style.    \"Why doesn't he do anything?\" he asked me.  \"I'v e talked to him about it, he's aware of it, but he \ndoes nothing.\"    \"Well, why don't you make an effective presentation?\"  I asked.    \"I did,\"  was the reply.    \"How do you define 'effective'?  Who do they send back to school when the salesman doesn't sell -- \nthe buyer?  Effective means it works; it means P/ PC.  Did you create the change you wanted?  Did \nyou build the relationship in the process?  Wh at were the results of your presentation?\" \n   \"I told you, he didn't do anything.

Are you willing to do \nthat?\"    \"Why do I have to go through all that?\" he asked \n   \"In other words, you want him to change his wh ole leadership style and you're not willing to change \nyour method of presentation?\"    \"I guess so,\" he replied.    \"Well, then,\" I said, \"just smile about it and learn to live with it.\" \n   \"I can't live with it,\"  he said.  \"It compromises my integrity.\"    \"Okay, then get to work on an effective pres entation.

Win-win requires a high \ndegree of both.

Ethos is your personal credibility, the faith peop le have in your integrity and competency.  It's the \ntrust that you inspire, your Emotional Bank Account.  Pathos is the empathic side -- it's the feeling.  It \nmeans that you are in alignment with the emotional tr ust of another person's communication.

You \nreally understand.  What you're presenting may ev en be different from what you had originally \nthought because in your effort to understand, you learned.    Habit 5 lifts you to greater accuracy, greater in tegrity, in your presentations.  And people know \nthat.  They know you're presenting the ideas whic h you genuinely believe, taking all known facts and \nperceptions into consideration, that will benefit everyone.  One-on-One     Habit 5 is powerful because it is right in the mi ddle of your Circle of Influence.  Many factors in \ninterdependent situations are in your Circle of  Concern -- problems, disagreements, circumstances, \nother people's behavior.  And if you focus your energies out there, you deplete them with little \npositive results.    But you can always seek first to understand.  Th at's something that's within your control.  And as \nyou do that, as you focus on your Circle of Influenc e, you really, deeply understand other people.  You \nhave accurate information to work with, you get to  the heart of matters quickly, you build Emotional \nBank Accounts, and you give people the psycholo gical air they need so you can work together \neffectively.    It's the Inside-Out approach.  And as you do it , watch what happens to your Circle of Influence.  \nBecause you really listen, you become influenceable.  And being influenceable is  the key to influencing \nothers.  Your circle begins to expand.  You increase  your ability to influence many of the things in \nyour Circle of Concern.    And watch what happens to you.  The more de eply you understand other people, the  more you \nwill appreciate them, the more reverent you will feel  about them.  To touch the soul of another human \nbeing is to walk on holy ground.    Habit 5 is something you can practice right no w.  The next time you communicate with anyone, \nyou can put aside your own autobiography and genuinely seek to understand.  Even when people don't want to open up about thei r problems, you can be empathic.  You can sense their hearts, you can \nsense the hurt, and \nyou can respond, \"You seem down toda y.\"  The y may say nothin g.  That's all ri ght.  \nYou've shown understanding and respect.    Don't push; be patient; be respectful.  Peopl e  d o n ' t  h a v e  t o  o p e n  u p  v e r b a l l y  b",

As well as seeking to \nunderstand each other, we often take time to actually practice empathic listening skills to help us in \ncommunicating with our children.    We often share our different perceptions of  the situation, and we role-play more effective \napproaches to difficult interpersonal family problems.    I may act as if I am a son or daughter requesti ng a special privilege even though I haven't fulfilled a \nbasic family responsibility, and Sandra plays herself \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n   We interact back and forth and try to visualize th e situation in a very real way so that we can train \nourselves to be consistent in modeling and teaching correct principles to our children.  Some of our \nmost helpful role-plays come from redoing a past difficu lt or stressful scene in which one of us \"blew it.\" \n   The time you invest to deeply understand the pe ople you love brings tremendous dividends in open \ncommunication.  Many of the problems that plague families and marriages simply don't have time to \nfester and develop.  The communic ation becomes so open that potential problems can be nipped in the \nbud.  And there are great reserves of trust in the Emotional Bank Account to handle the problems that \ndo arise.    In business, you can set up one-on-one time with your employees.  Listen to them, understand \nthem.  Set up human resource accounting or Stakeh older Information Systems in your business to get \nhonest, accurate feedback at every level:  from  customers, suppliers, and employees.  Make the \nhuman element as important as the financial or the technical element.  You save tremendous amounts \nof time, energy, and money when you tap into the hu man resources of a business at every level.  When \nyou listen, you learn.  And you also give the people  who work for you and with you psychological air.  \nYou inspire loyalty that goes well beyond the eight-to-five physical demands of the job. \n   Seek first to understand.  Before the problems come up, before you try to evaluate and prescribe, \nbefore you try to present your own ideas -- seek to understand.  It's a powerful habit of effective interdependence.    When we really, deeply understand each other, we open the door to creative solutions and Third \nAlternatives.  Our differences are no longer st umbling blocks to communication and progress.  \nInstead, they become the st epping stones to synergy. \n Application Suggestions     1.  Select a relationship in which you sense th e Emotional Bank Account is in the red.  Try to \nunderstand and write down the situation from the other person's point of view.  In your next \ninteraction, listen for understanding, comparing wh at you are hearing with what you wrote down.  \nHow valid were your assumptions?  Did you really  understand that individual's perspective. \n",
