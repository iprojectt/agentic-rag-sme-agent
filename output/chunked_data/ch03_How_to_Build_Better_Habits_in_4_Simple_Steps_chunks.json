Thorndike was interested in studying\nthe behavior of animals, and he started by working with\ncats.\nHe would place each cat inside a device known as a\npuzzle box. The box was designed so that the cat could\nescape through a door “ by some simple act, such as pulling\nat a loop of cord, pressing a lever , or stepping on a\nplatform.” F or example, one box contained a lever that,\nwhen pressed, would open a door on the side of the box.\nOnce the door had been opened, the cat could dart out and\nrun over to a bowl of food.\nMost cats wanted to escape as soon as they were placed\ninside the box. They would poke their nose into the corners,\nstick their paws through openings, and claw at loose\nobjects. A fter a few minutes of exploration, the cats would\nhappen to press the magical lever , the door would open,\nand they would escape.\nThorndike tracked the behavior of each cat across many\ntrials. In the beginning, the animals moved around the box\nat random. But as soon as the lever had been pressed and\nthe door opened, the process of learning began. Gradually ,\neach cat learned to associate the action of pressing the\nlever with the reward of escaping the box and getting to\nthe food.\nAfter twenty to thirty trials, this behavior became so\nautomatic and habitual that the cat could escape within a\nfew seconds. F or example, Thorndike noted, “Cat 12 took\nthe following times to perform the act. 160 seconds, 30\nseconds, 90 seconds, 60, 15, 28, 20, 30, 22, 11, 15, 20, 12,\n10, 14, 10, 8, 8, 5, 10, 8, 6, 6, 7.”\nDuring the ﬁrst three trials, the cat escaped in an\naverage of 1.5 minutes. During the last three trials, it\nescaped in an average of 6.3 seconds. W ith practice, each\ncat made fewer errors and their actions became quicker\nand more automatic. R ather than repeat the same\nmistakes, the cat began to cut straight to the solution.\nFrom his studies, Thorndike described the learning\nprocess by stating, “ behaviors followed by satisfying\nconsequences tend to be repeated and those that produce\nunpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated.”\nHis work provides the perfect starting point for discussing\nhow habits form in our own lives. It also provides answers\nto some fundamental questions like: What are habits? And\nwhy does the brain bother building them at all?\nWHY Y OUR BRAIN BUILDS HABITS\nA habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times\nto become automatic. The process of habit formation\nbegins with trial and error . Whenever you encounter a new\nsituation in life, your brain has to make a decision. How do\nI respond to this?  The ﬁrst time you come across a\nproblem, you’re not sure how to solve it. Like Thorndike’s\ncat, you’re just trying things out to see what works.\nNeurological activity in the brain is high during this\nperiod. Y ou are carefully analyzing the situation and\nmaking conscious decisions about how to act. Y ou’re taking\nin tons of new information and trying to make sense of it\nall. The brain is busy learning the most eﬀective course of\naction.\nOccasionally , like a cat pressing on a lever , you stumble\nacross a solution. Y ou’re feeling anxious, and you discover\nthat going for a run calms you down. Y ou’re mentally\nexhausted from a long day of work, and you learn that\nplaying video games relaxes you. Y ou’re exploring,\nexploring, exploring, and then—BAM—a reward.\nAfter you stumble upon an unexpected reward, you alter\nyour strategy for next time. Y our brain immediately begins\nto catalog the events that preceded the reward. Wait a\nminute—that felt good. What did I do right before that?\nThis is the feedback loop behind all human behavior: try ,\nfail, learn, try diﬀerently . With practice, the useless\nmovements fade away and the useful actions get\nreinforced. That’s a habit forming.\nWhenever you face a problem repeatedly , your brain\nbegins to automate the process of solving it. Y our habits\nare just a series of automatic solutions that solve the\nproblems and stresses you face regularly .",

Y our habits\nare just a series of automatic solutions that solve the\nproblems and stresses you face regularly . As behavioral\nscientist Jason Hreha writes, “ Habits are, simply , reliable\nsolutions to recurring problems in our environment.”\nAs habits are created, the level of activity in the brain\ndecreases . You learn to lock in on the cues that predict\nsuccess and tune out everything else. When a similar\nsituation arises in the future, you know exactly what to look\nfor. There is no longer a need to analyze every angle of a\nsituation. Y our brain skips the process of trial and error and\ncreates a mental rule: if this, then that. These cognitive\nscripts can be followed automatically whenever the\nsituation is appropriate. Now , whenever you feel stressed,\nyou get the itch to run. As soon as you walk in the door\nfrom work, you grab the video game controller . A choice\nthat once required eﬀort is now automatic. A habit has\nbeen created.\nHabits are mental shortcuts learned from experience. In\na sense, a habit is just a memory of the steps you previously\nfollowed to solve a problem in the past. Whenever the\nconditions are right, you can draw on this memory and\nautomatically apply the same solution. The primary reason\nthe brain remembers the past is to better predict what will\nwork in the future.\nHabit formation is incredibly useful because the\nconscious mind is the bottleneck of the brain. It can only\npay attention to one problem at a time. As a result, your\nbrain is always working to preserve your conscious\nattention for whatever task is most essential. Whenever\npossible, the conscious mind likes to pawn oﬀ tasks to the\nnonconscious mind to do automatically . This is precisely\nwhat happens when a habit is formed. Habits reduce\ncognitive load and free up mental capacity , so you can\nallocate your attention to other tasks.\nDespite their eﬀiciency , some people still wonder about\nthe beneﬁts of habits.

Without good health habits, you will always seem to\nbe short on energy . Without good learning habits, you will\nalways feel like you’re behind the curve. If you’re always\nbeing forced to make decisions about simple tasks—when\nshould I work out, where do I go to write, when do I pay\nthe bills—then you have less time for freedom.

Building habits in the present allows you to do\nmore of what you want in the future.\nTHE SCIENCE OF HOW HABITS WORK\nThe process of building a habit can be divided into four\nsimple steps: cue, craving, response, and reward. *\nBreaking it down into these fundamental parts can help us\nunderstand what a habit is, how it works, and how to\nimprove it.\nFIGURE 5:  All habits pr oceed thr ough four stages in the same\norder: cue, craving, r esponse, and r ewar d.\nThis four-step pattern is the backbone of every habit, and\nyour brain runs through these steps in the same order each\ntime.\nFirst, there is the cue.

(Of course,\nthese pursuits also indirectly improve our odds of survival\nand reproduction, which is the deeper motive behind\neverything we do .)\nYour mind is continuously analyzing your internal and\nexternal environment for hints of where rewards are\nlocated. Because the cue is the ﬁrst indication that we’re\nclose to a reward, it naturally leads to a craving.\nCravings are the second step, and they are the\nmotivational force behind every habit. W ithout some level\nof motivation or desire—without craving a change—we\nhave no reason to act. What you crave is not the habit itself\nbut the change in state it delivers. Y ou do not crave\nsmoking a cigarette, you crave the feeling of relief it\nprovides. Y ou are not motivated by brushing your teeth but\nrather by the feeling of a clean mouth. Y ou do not want to\nturn on the television, you want to be entertained. Every\ncraving is linked to a desire to change your internal state.\nThis is an important point that we will discuss in detail\nlater.\nCravings diﬀer from person to person. In theory , any\npiece of information could trigger a craving, but in\npractice, people are not motivated by the same cues. F or a\ngambler , the sound of slot machines can be a potent trigger\nthat sparks an intense wave of desire. F or someone who\nrarely gambles, the jingles and chimes of the casino are\njust background noise. Cues are meaningless until they are\ninterpreted. The thoughts, feelings, and emotions of the\nobserver are what transform a cue into a craving.\nThe third step is the response. The response is the actual\nhabit you perform, which can take the form of a thought or\nan action. Whether a response occurs depends on how\nmotivated you are and how much friction is associated with\nthe behavior . If a particular action requires more physical\nor mental eﬀort than you are willing to expend, then you\nwon’t do it. Y our response also depends on your ability . It\nsounds simple, but a habit can occur only if you are capable\nof doing it. If you want to dunk a basketball but can’t jump\nhigh enough to reach the hoop, well, you’re out of luck.\nFinally , the response delivers a reward. Rewards are the\nend goal of every habit. The cue is about noticing the\nreward. The craving is about wanting the reward. The\nresponse is about obtaining the reward. W e chase rewards\nbecause they serve two purposes: (1) they satisfy us and (2)\nthey teach us.\nThe ﬁrst purpose of rewards is to satisfy your craving .\nYes, rewards provide beneﬁts on their own. F ood and water\ndeliver the energy you need to survive. Getting a promotion\nbrings more money and respect. Getting in shape improves\nyour health and your dating prospects. But the more\nimmediate beneﬁt is that rewards satisfy your craving to\neat or to gain status or to win approval. A t least for a\nmoment, rewards deliver contentment and relief from\ncraving.\nSecond, rewards teach us which actions are worth\nremembering in the future. Y our brain is a reward detector .\nAs you go about your life, your sensory nervous system is\ncontinuously monitoring which actions satisfy your desires\nand deliver pleasure. Feelings of pleasure and\ndisappointment are part of the feedback mechanism that\nhelps your brain distinguish useful actions from useless\nones. Rewards close the feedback loop and complete the\nhabit cycle.\nIf a behavior is insuﬀicient in any of the four stages, it\nwill not become a habit. Eliminate the cue and your habit\nwill never start. Reduce the craving and you won’t\nexperience enough motivation to act. Make the behavior\ndiﬀicult and you won’t be able to do it.

This cycle is known as the habit loop.\nThis four-step process is not something that happens\noccasionally , but rather it is an endless feedback loop that\nis running and active during every moment you are alive—\neven now . The brain is continually scanning the\nenvironment, predicting what will happen next, trying out\ndiﬀerent responses, and learning from the results. The\nentire process is completed in a split second, and we use it\nagain and again without realizing everything that has been\npacked into the previous moment.\nWe can split these four steps into two phases: the\nproblem phase and the solution phase. The problem phase\nincludes the cue and the craving, and it is when you realize\nthat something needs to change. The solution phase\nincludes the response and the reward, and it is when you\ntake action and achieve the change you desire.\nProblem phase\n1. Cue\n2. Craving\nSolution phase\n3. Response\n4. Reward\nAll behavior is driven by the desire to solve a problem.\nSometimes the problem is that you notice something good\nand you want to obtain it. Sometimes the problem is that\nyou are experiencing pain and you want to relieve it. Either\nway, the purpose of every habit is to solve the problems you\nface.\nIn the table on the following page, you can see a few\nexamples of what this looks like in real life.\nImagine walking into a dark room and ﬂipping on the\nlight switch. Y ou have performed this simple habit so many\ntimes that it occurs without thinking. Y ou proceed through\nall four stages in the fraction of a second. The urge to act\nstrikes you without thinking.\nProblem phase\n1. Cue:  Your phone buzzes with a new te xt message.\n2. Craving:  You want to lear n the contents of the message.\nSolution phase\n3. Response:  You grab your phone and r ead the te xt.\n4. Reward:  You satisf y your craving to r ead the message. Grabbing your\nphone becomes associated with your phone buzzing.\nProblem phase\n1. Cue:  You ar e answering emails.\n2. Craving:  You begin to feel str essed and overwhelmed by work. Y ou want to\nfeel in contr ol.\nSolution phase\n3. Response:  You bite your nails.\n4. Reward:  You satisf y your craving to r educe str ess. Biting your nails\nbecomes associated with answering email.\nProblem phase\n1. Cue:  You wak e up.\n2. Craving:  You want to feel alert.\nSolution phase\n3. Response:  You drink a cup of coﬀee.\n4. Reward:  You satisf y your craving to feel alert. Drinking coﬀee becomes\nassociated with waking up.\nProblem phase\n1. Cue:  You smell a doughnut shop as you walk down the str eet near your\noﬃce.\n2. Craving:  You begin to crave a doughnut.\nSolution phase\n3. Response:  You buy a doughnut and eat it.\n4. Reward:  You satisf y your craving to eat a doughnut. Buying a doughnut\nbecomes associated with walking down the str eet near your oﬃce.\nProblem phase\n1. Cue:  You hit a stumbling block on a pr oject at work.\n2. Craving:  You feel stuck and want to r elieve your frustration.\nSolution phase\n3. Response:  You pull out your phone and check social media.\n4. Reward:  You satisf y your craving to feel r elieved. Checking social media\nbecomes associated with feeling stalled at work.\nProblem phase\n1. Cue:  You walk into a dark r oom.\n2. Craving:  You want to be able to see.\nSolution phase\n3. Response:  You ﬂip the light switch.\n4. Reward:  You satisf y your craving to see. T urning on the light switch\nbecomes associated with being in a dark r oom.\nBy the time we become adults, we rarely notice the\nhabits that are running our lives.

But before we\ndo that, we need to transform these four steps into a\npractical framework that we can use to design good habits\nand eliminate bad ones.\nI refer to this framework as the Four Laws of Behavior\nChange , and it provides a simple set of rules for creating\ngood habits and breaking bad ones. Y ou can think of each\nlaw as a lever that inﬂuences human behavior . When the\nlevers are in the right positions, creating good habits is\neﬀortless. When they are in the wrong positions, it is nearly\nimpossible.\nHow to Create a Good Habit\nThe 1st law (Cue):  Make it obvious.\nThe 2nd law (Craving):  Make it attractive.\nThe 3rd law (Response):  Make it easy .\nThe 4th law (Reward):  Make it satisf ying.\nWe can invert these laws to learn how to break a bad\nhabit.\nHow to Break a Bad Habit\nInversion of the 1st law (Cue):  Make it invisible.\nInversion of the 2nd law (Craving):  Make it unattractive.\nInversion of the 3rd law (Response):  Make it diﬃcult.\nInversion of the 4th law (Reward):  Make it unsatisf ying.\nIt would be irresponsible for me to claim that these four\nlaws are an exhaustive framework for changing any human\nbehavior , but I think they’re close. As you will soon see, the\nFour Laws of Behavior Change apply to nearly every ﬁeld,\nfrom sports to politics, art to medicine, comedy to\nmanagement. These laws can be used no matter what\nchallenge you are facing. There is no need for completely\ndiﬀerent strategies for each habit.\nWhenever you want to change your behavior , you can\nsimply ask yourself:\n1. How can I make it obvious?\n2. How can I make it attractive?\n3. How can I make it easy?\n4. How can I make it satisfying?\nIf you have ever wondered, “ Why don’t I do what I say\nI’m going to do? Why don’t I lose the weight or stop\nsmoking or save for retirement or start that side business?\nWhy do I say something is important but never seem to\nmake time for it?” The answers to those questions can be\nfound somewhere in these four laws. The key to creating\ngood habits and breaking bad ones is to understand these\nfundamental laws and how to alter them to your\nspeciﬁcations. Every goal is doomed to fail if it goes against\nthe grain of human nature.\nYour habits are shaped by the systems in your life. In the\nchapters that follow , we will discuss these laws one by one\nand show how you can use them to create a system in\nwhich good habits emerge naturally and bad habits wither\naway .\nChapter Summary\nA habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough\ntimes to become automatic.\nThe ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems\nof life with as little energy and eﬀort as possible.\nAny habit can be broken down into a feedback loop\nthat involves four steps: cue, craving, response, and\nreward.\nThe F our Laws of Behavior Change are a simple set of\nrules we can use to build better habits. They are (1)\nmake it obvious, (2) make it attractive, (3) make it easy ,\nand (4) make it satisfying.",

A fter decades of mental programming, we\nautomatically slip into these patterns of thinking and\nacting.\nTHE FOUR LA WS OF BEHA VIOR CHANGE\nIn the following chapters, we will see time and again how\nthe four stages of cue, craving, response, and reward\ninﬂuence nearly everything we do each day . But before we\ndo that, we need to transform these four steps into a\npractical framework that we can use to design good habits\nand eliminate bad ones.\nI refer to this framework as the Four Laws of Behavior\nChange , and it provides a simple set of rules for creating\ngood habits and breaking bad ones. Y ou can think of each\nlaw as a lever that inﬂuences human behavior . When the\nlevers are in the right positions, creating good habits is\neﬀortless. When they are in the wrong positions, it",
