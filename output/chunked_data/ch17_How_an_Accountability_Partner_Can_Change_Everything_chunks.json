    "text": "IT CONTRACT\nThe ﬁrst seat belt law was passed in New Y ork on\nDecember 1, 1984. A t the time, just 14 percent of people in\nthe United States regularly wore a seat belt—but that was\nall about to change.\nWithin ﬁve years, over half of the nation had seat belt\nlaws. T oday, wearing a seat belt is enforceable by law in\nforty-nine of the ﬁfty states. And it’s not just the legislation,\nthe number of people wearing seat belts has changed\ndramatically as well. In 2016, over 88 percent of Americans\nbuckled up each time they got in a car . In just over thirty\nyears, there was a complete reversal in the habits of\nmillions of people.\nLaws and regulations are an example of how government\ncan change our habits by creating a social contract. As a\nsociety , we collectively agree to abide by certain rules and\nthen enforce them as a group. Whenever a new piece of\nlegislation impacts behavior—seat belt laws, banning\nsmoking inside restaurants, mandatory recycling—it is an\nexample of a social contract shaping our habits. The group\nagrees to act in a certain way , and if you don’t follow along,\nyou’ll be punished.\nJust as governments use laws to hold citizens\naccountable, you can create a habit contract to hold\nyourself accountable. A habit contract is a verbal or written\nagreement in which you state your commitment to a\nparticular habit and the punishment that will occur if you\ndon’t follow through. Then you ﬁnd one or two people to\nact as your accountability partners and sign oﬀ on the\ncontract with you.\nBryan Harris, an entrepreneur from Nashville,\nTennessee, was the ﬁrst person I saw put this strategy into\naction. Shortly after the birth of his son, Harris realized he\nwanted to shed a few pounds. He wrote up a habit contract\nbetween himself , his wife, and his personal trainer . The ﬁrst\nversion read, “Bryan’s #1 objective for Q1 of 2017 is to\nstart eating correctly again so he feels better , looks better ,\nand is able to hit his long-term goal of 200 pounds at 10%\nbody fat.”\nBelow that statement, Harris laid out a road map for\nachieving his ideal outcome:\nPhase #1: Get back to a strict “slow-carb” diet in Q1.\nPhase #2: Start a strict macronutrient tracking\nprogram in Q2.\nPhase #3: Reﬁne and maintain the details of his diet\nand workout program in Q3.\nFinally , he wrote out each of the daily habits that would\nget him to his goal. F or example, “ Write down all food that\nhe consumes each day and weigh himself each day .”\nAnd then he listed the punishment if he failed: “If Bryan\ndoesn’t do these two items then the following consequence\nwill be enforced: He will have to dress up each workday\nand each Sunday morning for the rest of the quarter .

The consequences escalated,\ntoo. If he missed his carbohydrate and protein targets, he\nhad to pay his trainer $100. And if he failed to weigh\nhimself , he had to give his wife $500 to use as she saw ﬁt.\nPerhaps most painfully , if he forgot to run sprints, he had to\ndress up for work every day and wear an Alabama hat the\nrest of the quarter—the bitter rival of his beloved Auburn\nteam.\nThe strategy worked. W ith his wife and trainer acting as\naccountability partners and with the habit contract\nclarifying exactly what to do each day , Harris lost the\nweight. *\nTo make bad habits unsatisfying, your best option is to\nmake them painful in the moment. Creating a habit\ncontract is a straightforward way to do exactly that.\nEven if you don’t want to create a full-blown habit\ncontract, simply having an accountability partner is useful.\nThe comedian Margaret Cho writes a joke or song every\nday.

She does the “song a day” challenge with a friend,\nwhich helps them both stay accountable. Knowing that\nsomeone is watching can be a powerful motivator . You are\nless likely to procrastinate or give up because there is an\nimmediate cost. If you don’t follow through, perhaps they’ll\nsee you as untrustworthy or lazy . Suddenly , you are not only\nfailing to uphold your promises to yourself , but also failing\nto uphold your promises to others.\nYou can even automate this process. Thomas Frank, an\nentrepreneur in Boulder , Colorado, wakes up at 5:55 each\nmorning. And if he doesn’t, he has a tweet automatically\nscheduled that says, “It’s 6:10 and I’m not up because I’m\nlazy! Reply to this for $5 via P ayPal (limit 5), assuming my\nalarm didn’t malfunction.”\nWe are always trying to present our best selves to the\nworld. W e comb our hair and brush our teeth and dress\nourselves carefully because we know these habits are likely\nto get a positive reaction. W e want to get good grades and\ngraduate from top schools to impress potential employers\nand mates and our friends and family . We care about the\nopinions of those around us because it helps if others like\nus. This is precisely why getting an accountability partner\nor signing a habit contract can work so well.\nChapter Summary\nThe inversion of the 4th Law of Behavior Change is\nmake it unsatisfying .\nWe are less likely to repeat a bad habit if it is painful or\nunsatisfying.\nAn accountability partner can create an immediate cost\nto inaction. W e care deeply about what others think of\nus, and we do not want others to have a lesser opinion\nof us.\nA habit contract can be used to add a social cost to any\nbehavior . It makes the costs of violating your promises\npublic and painful.\nKnowing that someone else is watching you can be a\npowerful motivator .\nHOW TO CREA TE A GOOD HABIT\nThe 1st Law: Mak e It Obvious\n1.1: Fill out the Habits Scor ecard. Write down your cur rent habits to become\nawar e of them.\n1.2: Use implementation intentions: “I will [BEHA VIOR] at [TIME] in\n[LOCATION].”\n1.3: Use habit stacking: “ After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”\n1.4: Design your envir onment. Mak e the cues of good habits obvious and\nvisible.\nThe 2nd Law:Mak e It Attractive\n2.1: Use temptation bundling. P air an action you want  to do with an action you\nneed  to do .\n2.2: Join a cultur e wher e your desir ed behavior is the nor mal behavior .\n2.3: Create a motivation ritual. Do something you enjoy immediately befor e a\ndiﬃcult habit.\nThe 3rd Law: Mak e It Easy\n3.1: Reduce friction. Decr ease the number of steps between you and your\ngood habits.\n3.2: Prime the envir onment. P repare your envir onment to mak e futur e actions\neasier .\n3.3: Master the decisive moment. Optimize the small choices that deliver\noutsized impact.\n3.4: Use the T wo-Minute R ule. Downscale your habits until they can be done in\ntwo minutes or less.\n3.5: Automate your habits. Invest in technology and onetime pur chases that\nlock in futur e behavior .\nThe 4th Law: Mak e It Satisfying\n4.1: Use r einfor cement.
