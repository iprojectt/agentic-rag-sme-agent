The \ntruth is, our energy as human beings seems to have a \ndualistic and teleological reality—we create and id entify with \nthings that aren't real yet on all the levels we ex perience; and \nwhen we do, we recognize how to restructure our cur rent world \nto morph it into the new one, and experience an imp etus to make \nit so. \nThings that have your attention need your in tention \nengaged. \"What does this mean to me?\" \"Why is it he re?\" \"What \ndo I want to have be true about this?\" (\"What's the  successful \n251 Defining specific \nprojects and next\nactions that address \nreal quality-of- \nlife issues is \nproductivity at\nits best.\nWe are constantly \ncreating and \nfulfilling.\nTHE POWER OF THE KEY PRINCIPLES  I  PART THREE \noutcome?\") Everything you experience as incomplete \nmust have a reference point for \"complete.\" \nOnce you've decide that there is something \nto be changed and a mold to fill, you ask yourself,\n\"How do I now make this happen?\" and/or \"What \nresources do I need to allocate to make it happen?\"\n(\"What's the next action?\"). \nYour life and work are made up of outcomes and \nactions. When your operational behavior is grooved \nto organize everything that comes your way, at all \nlevels, based upon those dynamics, a deep align- \nment occurs, and wondrous things emerge. You be- \ncome highly productive. You make things up, and you  make them \nhappen. \n252 The Magic of Mastering the Mundane \nMy clients often wonder how I can sit with them in their offices, \noften for hours on end, as they empty the drawers o f their desks \nand painstakingly go through the minutiae of stuff that they have \nlet accumulate in their minds and their physical sp ace. Aside from \nthe common embarrassment they feel about the volume  of their \nirresponsibly dealt-with details, they assume I sho uld be bored to \ntears. Quite the contrary.

This thinking, and the tools that suppo rt \nit, will serve you in ways you may not yet imagine.\nThe Power of Natural Planning \nThe value of all this natural project planning is t hat it \nprovides an integrated, flexible, aligned way to th ink \nthrough any situation. \nBeing comfortable with challenging the pur- \npose of anything you may be doing is healthy and ma ture. Being \nable to \"make up\" visions and images of success, be fore the meth- \nods are clear, is a phenomenal trait to strengthen.  Being willing to \n253 Multilevel Outcome Management The \nchallenge is to marry high-level\nidealistic focus to \nthe mundane \nactivity of life. In the \nend they require the \nsame thinking.\nAn idealist believes \nthat the short run \ndoesn't count. A \ncynic believes the \nlong run doesn't \nmatter. A realist \nbelieves that what \nis done or left \nundone in the short \nrun determines the \nlong run. \n—Sidney]. \n254 THE POWER OF THE KEY PRINCIPLES  I  PART THREE \nhave ideas, good or bad, and to express and capture  all of them \nwithout judgments is critical for fully accessing c reative intelli- \ngence. Honing multiple ideas and types of informati on into com- \nponents, sequences, and priorities aimed toward a s pecific \noutcome is a necessary mental discipline. And decid ing on and \ntaking real next actions—actually moving on somethi ng in the \nphysical world—are the essence of productivity. \nBeing able to bring all these ingredients together,  with \nappropriate timing and balance, is perhaps the majo r component \nof professional competence for this new millennium.  But it's not \nyet the norm in professional behavior; far from it.  It's still a daunt- \ning task to apply this awareness to all the aspects  of personal and \nprofessional life. But even when only portions of t he model are \ninserted, tremendous benefit ensues. \nThe feedback I have gotten over the years in my con sulting, \nteaching, and coaching with this model has continue d to validate \nthat even the slightest increase in the use of natu ral planning can \nbring significant improvement. To see brainstorming  about \nalmost every aspect of their lives becoming a stand ard tool for \nmany people is terrific. To hear from executives wh o have used the \nmodel as a way to frame key meetings and discussion s, and have \ngotten great value from doing that, is gratifying. It all just affirms \nthat the way our minds naturally work is the way th at we should \nfocus to make anything happen in the physical world . \nThe model is simply the basic principle of determin ing out- \ncomes and actions for everything we consider to be our work. \nWhen those two key focus points become the norm in our day- \nto-day lives, the baseline for productivity moves t o another level. \nThe addition of brainstorming—the most creative mea ns of \nexpressing and capturing ideas, perspectives, and d etails about \nprojects—makes for an elegant set of behaviors for staying relaxed \nand getting things done. \nCHAPTER 13  | THE POWER OF OUTCOME FOCUSING \nShifting to a Positive Organizational Culture \nIt doesn't take a big change to increase the produc tivity standards \nof a group. I continually get feedback indicating t hat with a little \nimplementation, this method immediately makes thing s happen \nmore quickly and more easily. \nThe constructive evaluation of activities, asset al locations, \ncommunications, policies, and procedures against pu rposes and \nintended outcomes has become increasingly critical for every \norganization I know of. The challenges to our compa nies con- \ntinue to mount, with pressures coming these days fr om globali- \nzation, competition, technology, shifting markets, and raised \nstandards of performance and production. \n\"What do we want to have happen in this meeting?\" \" What \nis the purpose of this form?\" \"What would the ideal  person for \nthis job be able to do?\" \"What do we want to accomp lish with this \nsoftware?\" These and a multitude of other, similar questions are \nstill sorely lacking in many quarters.
