They all go into \"in,\" so they'll be avail able \nfor later processing. \n106 What Stays Where It Is \nThe best way to create a clean decision about wheth er something \nshould go into the in-basket is to understand clear ly what shouldn't \ngo in. Here are the four categories of things that can remain \nwhere they are, the way they are, with no action ti ed to them: \n• Supplies \n• Reference material \n• Decoration \n• Equipment \nSupplies . . . include anything you need to keep because you use \nit regularly. Stationery, business cards, stamps, s taples, Post-it \npads, legal pads, paper clips, ballpoint refills, b atteries, forms you \nneed to fill out from time to time, rubber bands—al l of these \nqualify. Many people also have a \"personal supplies \" drawer at \nwork containing dental floss, Kleenex, breath mints , and so on. Train yourself to \nnotice and collect \nanything that \ndoesn't belong \nwhere it is forever. \nCHAPTER 5  I  COLLECTION: CORRALLING YOUR \"STUFF\" \nReference Material ... is anything you simply keep for informa- \ntion as needed, such as manuals for your software, the local take- \nout deli menu, or your kid's soccer schedule. This category \nincludes your telephone and address information, an y material \nrelevant to projects, themes, and topics, and sourc es such as dic- \ntionaries, encyclopedias, and almanacs. \nDecoration . . . means pictures of family, artwork, and fun and \ninspiring things pinned to your bulletin board. You  also might \nhave plaques, mementos, and/or plants. \nEquipment ... is obviously the telephone, computer, fax, prin ter, \nwastebasket, furniture, and/or VCR. \nYou no doubt have a lot of things that fall into th ese four catego- \nries—basically all your tools and your gear, which have no \nactions \ntied to them. Everything else goes into \"in.\" But m any of the \nthings you might initially interpret as supplies, r eference, decora- \ntion, or equipment could also have action associate d with them \nbecause they still aren't exactly the way they need  to be. \nFor instance, most people have, in their desk drawe rs and on \ntheir credenzas and bulletin boards, a lot of refer ence materials \nthat either are out of date or need to be organized  somewhere \nelse. Those should go into \"in.\" Likewise, if your supplies drawer \nis out of control, full of lots of dead or unorgani zed stuff, that's an \nincomplete that needs to be captured. Are the photo s of your kids \ncurrent ones? Is the artwork what you want on the wall? Are the \nmementos really something you still want to keep? I s the furni- \nture precisely the way it should be? Is the compute r set up the way \nyou want it? Are the plants in your office alive?

If your \norganization system winds up containing some of the se pieces of \npaper representing something else, it'll be useful to know when the \nnote was created. It's also just a great habit to d ate everything you \nhand-write, from Post-it notes to your assistant, t o voice-mails you \ndownload onto a pad, to notes you take on a phone c all with a \nclient. The 3 percent of the time that this little piece of informa- \ntion will be extremely useful makes it worth develo ping the habit. \nWhat If the Pile Is Too Big to Fit into the In-Bask et? If you're like \n98 percent of my clients, your initial gathering ac tivity will collect \nmuch more than can be comfortably stacked in an in- basket. If \nthat's the case, just create stacks around the in-b asket, and maybe \neven on the floor underneath it. Ultimately you'll be emptying the \nin-stacks, as you process and organize everything. In the mean- \ntime, though, make sure that there's some obvious v isual distinc- \ntion between the stacks that are \"in\" and everythin g else. \nCHAPTER 5  |  COLLECTION: CORRALLING YOUR \"STUFF\" \nInstant Dumping If it's immediately evident that something is \ntrash, go ahead and toss it when you see it. For so me of my clients, \nthis marks the first time they have ever cleaned th eir center desk \ndrawer! \nIf you're not sure what something is or whether it' s worth \nkeeping, go ahead and put it into \"in.\" You'll be a ble to decide \nabout it later, when you process the in-basket. Wha t you don't \nwant to do is to let yourself get wrapped up in thi ngs piece by \npiece, trying to decide this or that. You'll do that later anyway  if \nit's in \"in,\" and it's easier to make those kinds o f choices when \nyou're in processing mode. The objective for the co llection process \nis to get everything into \"in\" as quickly as possible so you've appro- \npriately retrenched and \"drawn the battle lines.\" \nBe Careful of the Purge-and-Organize Bug! Many people get hit \nwith the purge-and-organize virus as they're going through vari- \nous areas of their office (and their home). If that  happens to you, \nit's OK, so long as you have a major open window of  time to get \nthrough the whole process (like at least a whole we ek ahead of \nyou). Otherwise you'll need to break it up into chu nks and cap- \nture them as little projects or actions to do, with  reminders in your \nsystem, like \"Purge four-drawer cabinet\" or \"Clean office closet.\" \nWhat you don't want to do is let yourself get caught running \ndown a rabbit trail cleaning up some piece of your work and then \nnot be able to get through the whole action-managem ent imple- \nmentation process. It may take longer than you thin k, and you \nwant to go for the gold and finish processing all y our stuff and set- \nting up your system as soon as possible. \nWhat About Things That Are Already on Lists and in Organizers'? \nYou may already have some lists and some sort of or ganization \nsystem in place. But unless you're thoroughly famil iar with this \nworkflow-processing model and have implemented it p reviously, \nI recommend that you treat those lists as items sti ll to be pro- \ncessed, like everything else in \"in.\" You'll want y our system to be \n109 \n110 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  |  PART TWO \nconsistent, and it'll be necessary to evaluate ever ything from the \nsame viewpoint to get it that way. \n\"But I Can't Lose That Thing . . . !\" Often in the collection \nprocess someone will run across a piece of paper or  a document \nthat causes her to say, \"Oh, my God! I forgot about  that! I've got to \ndeal with that!\" It could be a phone slip with a re turn call she was \nsupposed to handle two days before, or some meeting  notes that \nremind her of an action she was supposed to take we eks ago. She \ndoesn't want to put whatever it is into the huge st ack of other stuff \nin her in-basket because she's afraid she might los e track of it \nagain. \nIf that happens to you, first ask yourself if it's something that \nreally has to be handled before you get though this initial im ple- \nmentation time. If so, best deal",
