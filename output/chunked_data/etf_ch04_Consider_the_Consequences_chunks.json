Something that is unimportant has few or no long-\nterm potential consequences.

Unsuccessful people, on the other hand,think more about short-term pleasure and immediate gratification\nwhile giving little thought to the long-term future.\nDennis Waitley, the motivational speaker, says, \"Failures do what is\ntension relieving while winners do what is goal achieving.\"\nFor example, coming in to work earlier, reading regularly in your\nfield, taking courses to improve your skills, and focusing on high\nvalue tasks in your work will all combine to have an enormous\npositive impact on your future.\nOn the other hand, coming in to work at the last moment, reading the\nnewspaper, drinking coffee and socializing with your coworkers may\nseem fun and enjoyable in the short-term but it inevitably leads to\nlack of promotion, underachievement and frustration in the long-\nterm.\nIf there is a task or activity with large potential positive\nconsequences, make it a top priority and get started on it\nimmediately. If there is something that can have large potential\nnegative consequences if it is not done quickly and well, that\nbecomes a top priority as well. Whatever your frog is, resolve to gulp\nit down first thing.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 35Motivation requires motive. The greater the positive potential impact\nthat an action or behavior of yours can have on your life, once you\ndefine it clearly, the more motivated you will be to overcome\nprocrastination and get it done quickly.\nKeep yourself focused and forward moving by continually starting\nand completing those tasks that can make a major difference to your\ncompany and to your future.\nRemember, the time is going to pass anyway. The only question is\nhow you use it and where you are going to end up at the end of the\nweeks and months. And where you end up is largely a matter of theamount of consideration you give to the likely consequences of your\nactions in the short term.\nThinking continually about the potential consequences of your\nchoices, decisions and behaviors is one of the very best ways to\ndetermine you true priorities in your work and personal life.\nObey the Law of Forced Efficiency\nThis law says that, \"There is never enough",

When you have\nno choice, when the consequences for non-completion are seriousenough, you start early, you stay late and you drive yourself tocomplete the job rather than to face the unpleasantness that would\nfollow if you didn't get it completed within the time limit.\nRule: \"There will never be enough time to do everything you\nhave to do.\"\nIt has been estimated that the average person in business today,\nespecially managers in the age of cutbacks, is working at 110% to\n130% of capacity. And the jobs and responsibilities just keep piling\nup. Everyone has stacks of reading material they still have to gothrough. One study concluded recently that the average executive\nhas 300-400 hours of reading and projects backlogged at home and at\nthe office.\nWhat this means is that you will never be caught up. Get that\nwonderful idea out of your mind. All you can hope for is to be on top\nof your most important responsibilities. The others will just have towait.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 37Deadlines Are an Excuse\nMany people say that they work better under the pressure of\ndeadlines. Unfortunately, years of research indicate that this isseldom true.\nUnder the pressure of deadlines, often self-created through\nprocrastination and delay, people suffer greater stress, make moremistakes, and have to do redo more tasks, than under any otherconditions. Often the mistakes that are made when people are\nworking under tight deadlines lead to defects and cost overruns that\nlead to substantial financial losses in the long-term. Sometimes thejob actually takes much longer to complete when people rush to get\nthe job done at the last minute and then have to redo it.\nIt is much better to plan your time carefully in advance, and then\nbuild in a sizable buffer to compensate for unexpected delays and\ndiversions.

Then, ask your boss. Ask your coworkers and subordinates.\nAsk your friends and family. Like focusing the lens of a camera, youmust be crystal clear about your highest value activities before youbegin work.\nThe second question you can ask continually is, \"What can I and only I\ndo, that if done well, will make a real difference?\"This question comes from Peter Drucker, the management guru. It is\none of the best of all questions for achieving personal effectiveness.What can you, and only you do, that if done well, can make a real\ndifference?\nThis is defined something that only  you can do. If you don't do it, it\nwon't be done by someone else. But if you do do it, and you do it\nwell, it can really make a difference to your life and your career.\nWhat is this particular frog for you?\nEvery hour of every day, you can ask yourself this question and there\nwill be a specific answer.

    "text": " question you can ask is \"What is the most valuable use of my\ntime, right now?\"\nWhat is my biggest frog of all at this moment?\nThis is the core question of time management. Answering this\nquestion correctly is the key to overcoming procrastination and\nbecoming a highly productive person. Every hour of every day, thereis some task that is the most valuable use of your time at thatmoment. Your job is to ask yourself this question, over and over\nagain, and to always be working on the answer to it, whatever it is.\nDo first things first and second things not at all. As Goethe said, \"The things\nthat matter most must never be at the mercy of the things that matter least.\"\nThe more accurate your answers to these questions, the easier it will\nbe for you to set clear priorities, to overcome procrastination and to\nget started on that one activity that represents the most valuable use\nof your time.\nEat That Frog!   \n1.  Review your list of tasks, activities and projects regularly.\nContinually ask yourself, “Which one project or activity, if I did it in\nan excellent and timely fashion, would have the greatest positive\nconsequences in my work or personal life?”\n",
