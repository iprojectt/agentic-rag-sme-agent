The world would mold men by changing th eir environment.  Christ changes men, who then \nchange their environment.

In \ndoing so, it is my hope that you will relate  to the underlying principles it contains. \n   Some years ago, our family took a sabbatical le ave from the university where I taught so that I could \nwrite.  We lived for a full year in Laie on the north shore of Oahu, Hawaii.    Shortly after getting settled, we developed a liv ing and working routine which was not only very \nproductive but extremely pleasant.    After an early morning run on the beach, we woul d send two of our children, barefoot and in shorts, \nto school.  I went to an isolated building next to the ca ne fields where I had an office to do my writing.  \nIt was very quiet, very beautiful, very serene -- no phone, no meetings, no pressing engagements. \n   My office was on the outside edge of the colle ge, and one day as I was wandering between stacks of \nbooks in the back of the college library, I came across a book that drew my interest.  As I opened it, my \neyes fell upon a single paragraph that power fully influenced the rest of my life. \n   I read the paragraph over and over again.  It ba sically contained the simple idea that there is a gap \nor a space between stimulus and re sponse, and that the key to both  our growth and happiness is how \nwe use that space.    I can hardly describe the effect that idea had on my mind.  Though I had been nurtured in the \nphilosophy of self-determinism, the way the idea was phrased -- \"a ga p between stimulus and response\" \n-- hit me with fresh, almost unbelievable force.  It was almost like \"knowing it for the first time,\" like an \ninward revolution, \"an idea whose time had come.\"    I reflected on it again and again, and it began to  have a powerful effect on my paradigm of life.  It \nwas as if I had become an observer of my own partic ipation.  I began to stand in that gap and to look \noutside at the stimuli.  I reveled in the inward sense of freedom to choose my response -- even to \nbecome the stimulus, or at least to influence it -- even to reverse it. \n   Shortly thereafter, and partly as  a result of this \"revolutionary\" id ea, Sandra and I began a practice of \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \ndeep communication.

I would pick her up a little be fore noon on an old red Honda 90 trail cycle, and \nwe would take our two preschool children with us -- on e between us and the othe r on my left knee -- as \nwe rode out in the canefields by my office.  We ro de slowly along for about an hour, just talking. \n   The children looked forward to the ride and hard ly ever made any noise.  We seldom saw another \nvehicle, and the cycle was so quiet we could easily  hear each other.  We usually ended up on an \nisolated beach where we parked th e Honda and walked about 200 yard s to a secluded spot where we \nate a picnic lunch.    The sandy beach and a freshwater river coming o ff the island totally absorbed the interest of the \nchildren, so Sandra and I were able to continue our talks uninterrupted.  Perhaps it doesn't take too much imagination to envision the level of understa nding and trust we were able to reach by spending \nat least two hours a day, every day, for a full year in deep communication.    At the very first of the year, we talked about all kinds of interesting topics -- people, ideas, events, \nthe children, my writing, our family at home, future  plans, and so forth.  But little by little, our \ncommunication deepened and we began to talk more and more about our intern al worlds -- about our \nupbringing, our scripting, our feelings, and self-d oubts.  As we were deep ly immersed in these \ncommunications, we also observed them and observed ourselves in them.  We began to use that space \nbetween stimulus and response in some new and inte resting ways which caused us to think about how \nwe were programmed and how those prog rams shaped how we saw the world. \n   We began an exciting adventure into our interi or worlds and found it to be more exciting, more \nfascinating, more absorbing, more compelling, more  filled with discovery and insight than anything \nwe'd even known in the outside world.    It wasn't all \"sweetness and light.\" We occasi onally hit some raw nerves and had some painful \nexperiences, embarrassing experiences, self-revealing experiences -- experiences that made us extremely \nopen and vulnerable to each other.  And yet we foun d we had been wanting to go into those things for \nyears.  When we did go into the deep er, more tender issues and then ca me out of them, we felt in some \nway healed.    We were so initially supportive and helpful, so  encouraging and empathic to each other, that we \nnurtured and facilitated these internal discoveries in each other.    We gradually evolved two unspoken ground rule s.  The first was \"no probing.\" As soon as we \nunfolded the inner layers of vulnerability, we were no t to question each other, only to empathize.  \nProbing was simply too invasive.  It was also too controlling and too logical.  We were covering new, \ndifficult terrain that was scary and uncertain, and it  stirred up fears and doubts.  We wanted to cover \nmore and more of it, but we grew to respect the n eed to let each other open up in our own time. \n   The second ground rule was that when it hurt  too much, when it was painful, we would simply quit \nfor the day.  Then we would either begin the next day where we left off or wa it until the person who \nwas sharing felt ready to continue.  We carried aro und the loose ends, knowing that we wanted to deal \nwith them.  But because we had th e time and the environment conduc ive to it, and because we were so \nexcited to observe our own involvement and to grow  within our marriage, we simply knew that sooner \nor later we would deal with all those loose ends  and bring them to some kind of closure. \n   The most difficult, and eventua lly the most fruitful part of this kind of communication came when \nmy vulnerability and Sandra's vulne rability touched.  Then, because of our subjective involvement, we \nfound that the space between stimulus  and response was no longer there.   A few bad feelings surfaced.  \nBut our deep desire and our implicit agreement was to prepare ourselves to st art where we left off and \ndeal with those feelings until we resolved them.    One of those difficult times had to do with a ba sic tendency in my person ality.  My father was a \nvery private individual -- very controlled and very careful.  My mother was and is very public, very \nopen, very spontaneous.  I find both sets of tend encies",

We had gone through many \nexperiences over the years in which I felt her ope nness was inappropriate, and she felt my constraint \nwas dysfunctional, both socially and to me as an individual because I would become insensitive to the \nfeelings of others.  All of this and much more came out during thos e deep visits.  I came to value \nSandra's insight and wisdom and the way she helped me  to be a more open, gi ving, sensitive, social \nperson.    Another of those difficult times had to do with  what I perceived to be a \"hang up\" Sandra had which \nhad bothered me for years.  She seemed to have an  obsession about Frigidaire appliances which I was \nat an absolute loss to understand.  She would not ev en consider buying another brand of appliance.  \nEven when we were just starting out and on a very tight budget, she insisted that we drive the fifty \nmiles to the \"big city\" where Frigidaire appliances  were sold, simply because no dealer in our small \nuniversity town carried them at that time.    This was a matter of considerable agitation to me.  Fortunately, the situation came up only when \nwe purchased an appliance.  But when it did come up , it was like a stimulus that triggered off a hot \nbutton response.  This single issue seemed to be sy mbolic of all irrational thinking, and it generated a \nwhole range of negative feelings within me.    I usually resorted to my dysfunctional private behavior.  I suppose I figu red that the only way I \ncould deal with it was not to deal with it; otherwise,  I felt I would lose control and say things I shouldn't \nsay.  There were times when I did slip and say something negative, and I had to go back and \napologize.    What bothered me the most was not that she liked  Frigidaire, but that she persisted in making what \nI considered utterly illogical and indefensible statemen ts to defend Frigidaire wh ich had no basis in fact \nwhatsoever.  If she had only agreed that her resp onse was irrational and purely emotional, I think I \ncould have handled it.  But her justification was upsetting.    It was sometime in early spring when the Frig idaire issue came up.  All our prior communication \nhad prepared us.  The ground rules had been deeply established -- not to probe and to leave it alone if \nit got to be too painful for either or both.    I will never forget the day we talked it through.  We didn't end up on the beach that day; we just \ncontinued to ride through the canefields, perhaps becaus e we didn't want to look each other in the eye.  \nThere had been so much psychic hist ory and so many bad feelings associ ated with the issue, and it had \nbeen submerged for so long.  It had never been so critical as to rupture the relationship, but when \nyou're trying to cultivate a beautiful unified re lationship, any divisive issue is important. \n   Sandra and I were amazed at what we learned throug h the interaction.  It was truly synergistic.  It \nwas as if Sandra were learning, almost for the first ti me herself, the reason for her so-called hang-up.  \nShe started to talk about her father, about how he had worked as a high school history teacher and \ncoach for years, and how, to help make ends meet, he  had gone into the appliance business.  During an \neconomic downturn, he had experien ced serious financial difficulties, and the only thing that enabled \nhim to stay in business during that time was the fact that Frigidaire would finance his inventory. \n   Sandra had an unusually deep and sweet relationsh ip with her father.  When  he returned home at \nthe end of a very tiring day, he wo uld lie on the couch, and Sandra woul d rub his feet and sing to him.  \nIt was a beautiful time they enjoye d together",

He would also open up and talk \nthrough his worries and concerns about the business, and he shared with Sand ra his deep appreciation \nfor Frigidaire financing his inventory so that he could make it through the difficult times. \n   This communication between father and daught er had taken place in a spontaneous way during \nvery natural time, when the most powerful kind of scripting takes place.  During those relaxed times \nguards are down and all kinds of images and thoughts are planted deep in the subc onscious mind.  \nPerhaps Sandra had forgotten about all of this until the safety of that year of communication when it \ncould come out also in very natural and spontaneous ways. \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \n   Sandra gained tremendous insight into herself and into the emotional root  of her feelings about \nFrigidaire.  I also gained insight and a whole new level of respect.  I came to realize that Sandra \nwasn't talking about appliances; she was talking abou t her father, and about loyalty -- about loyalty to \nhis needs.    I  r e m e m b e r  b o t h  o f  u s  b e c o m i n g  t e a r f u l  o n  t h a t  d a y ,  n o t  s o  m u c h  b e c a u s e  o f  t h e  i n s i g h t s ,  b u t  because of the increased sense of reverence we had fo r each other.  We discovered that even seemingly \ntrivial things often have roots in d eep emotional experiences.  To deal  only with the superficial trivia \nwithout seeing the deeper, more tender issues is to  trample on the sacred ground of another's heart. \n   There were many rich fruits of those months .  Our communication beca me so powerful that we \ncould almost instantly connect wi th each other's thoughts.  When  we left Hawaii, we resolved to \ncontinue the practice.  During the many years sinc e, we have continued to go regularly on our Honda \ntrail cycle, or in the car if the weather's bad, just to talk.  We feel the key to st aying in love is to talk, \nparticularly about feelings.  We try to communicate  with each other several times every day, even \nwhen I'm traveling.  It's like touching in to home  base, which accesses all the happiness, security, and \nvalues it represents.    Thomas Wolfe was wrong.  You can go home ag ain -- if your home is a treasured relationship, a \nprecious companionship.  Intergenerational Living     As Sandra and I discovered that wonderful year, the ability to use wisely the gap between stimulus \nand response, to exercise the four unique endowm ents of our human nature, empowered us from the \nInside-Out.    We had tried the outside-in approach.  We  loved each other, and we had attempted to work \nthrough our differences by controlling our attitudes an d our behaviors, by practicing useful techniques \nof human interaction.  But our band-aids and aspiri n only lasted so long.  Until we worked and \ncommunicated on the level of our essential paradigms , the chronic underlying problems were still there. \n   When we began to work from the Inside-Out, we were able to build a relationship of trust and \nopenness and to resolve dysfunctional differences in  a deep and lasting way that never could have \ncome by working from the outside in.  The delicious fruits -- a ri ch win-win relationship, a deep \nunderstanding of each other, and a marvelous sy nergy -- grew out of the roots we nurtured as we \nexamined our programs, rescripted ourselves, and ma naged our lives so that we could create time for \nthe important Quadrant II activity of co mmunicating deeply with each other. \n   And there were other fruits.  We were able to see on a much deeper level th at, just as powerfully as \nour own lives had been affected by our parents, the lives of our children were being influenced and \nshaped by us, often in ways we didn 't even begin to realize.  Understanding the power of scripting in \nour own lives, we felt a renewed desire to do",

Understanding the power of scripting in \nour own lives, we felt a renewed desire to do ever ything we could to make certain that what we passed \non to future generations, by both precept an d example, was based on correct principles. \n   I have drawn particular attention in this b ook to those scripts we have been given which we \nproactively want to change.  But as we examine our scripting carefully, many of us will also begin to \nsee beautiful scripts, positive scripts that have been  passed down to us which we have blindly taken for \ngranted.  Real self-awareness helps us to apprecia te those scripts and to appreciate those who have \ngone before us and nurtured us in principle-based living, mirroring back to us not only what we are, \nbut what we can become.    There is transcendent power in a strong interg enerational family.  An effectively interdependent \nfamily of children, parents, grandparents, aunts, un cles, and cousins can be a powerful force in helping \npeople have a sense of who they are and wher e they came from and what they stand for. \n   It's great for children to be able to identify th emselves with the \"tribe,\" to feel that many people \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \nknow them and care about them, even though they're spread all over the country.  And that can be a \ntremendous benefit as you nurture your family.  If one of your children is having difficulty and doesn't \nreally relate with you at a particular time in his life,  maybe he can relate to yo ur brother or sister who \ncan become a surrogate father or mother, a mentor, or a hero for a period of time.    Grandparents who show a great interest in thei r grandchildren are among th e most precious people \non this earth.  What a marvelous positive social mi rror they can be!  My mother is like that.  Even \nnow, in her late 80s, she takes a deep personal intere st in every one of her descendants.  She writes us \nlove letters.  I was reading one the other day on a plane with tears streaming down my cheeks.  I \ncould call her up tonight and I know she'd say, \"Ste phen, I want  you to know how much I love you \nand how wonderful I think you are.\" She's constantly reaffirming.    A strong intergenerational family is potentially one of the most fruitful, rewarding, and satisfying \ninterdependent relationships.  And many people feel the importance of that relationship.  Look at the \nfascination we all had with Roots some years ago.  Each of us has roots and the ability to trace those roots, to identify our ancestors.    The highest and most powerful motivation in doing that is no t for ourselves only, but for our \nposterity, for the posterity of all mankind.  As someone once observed, \"The re are only two lasting \nbequests we can give our children -- one is roots, the other wings.\" \n Becoming a Transition Person     Among other things, I believe that giving \"win gs\" to our children and to others means empowering \nthem with the freedom to rise above negative scripti ng that had been passed do wn to us.  I believe it \nmeans becoming what my friend and associate, Dr. Terry Warner, calls a \"transition\" person.  Instead \nof transferring those scripts to the next generatio n, we can change them.  And we can do it in a way \nthat will build relationships in the process    If your parents abused you as a child, that does not mean that you have to abuse your own children.  \nYet there's plenty of evidence to indicate that you w ill tend to live out that script.  But because you're \nproactive, you can rewrite the script.  You can choose not only not to abuse your children, but to affirm them, to script them in positive ways.    You can write it in your personal mission statement and into your mind and heart.  You can \nvisualize yourself living in harmony with that missi on statement in your Daily Private Victory.  You \ncan take steps to love and forgive your own parents, and if they are still living, to build a positive relationship with them by seeking to understand.    A tendency that's run through your family for generations can stop with you.  You're a transition \nperson -- a",

A tendency that's run through your family for generations can stop with you.  You're a transition \nperson -- a link between the past and the future.  And your own change can affect many, many lives \ndownstream.    One powerful transition person of  the twentieth century, Anwar Sadat, left us as part of his legacy a \nprofound understanding of the nature of change.  Sadat stood between a past that had created a \"huge \nwall of suspicion, fear, hate and misunderstanding \" between Arabs and Israe lis, and a future in which \nincreased conflict and isolation seemed inevitable.  Ef forts at negotiation had been met with objections \non every scale -- even to formalities and procedural points, to an insignificant comma or period in the \ntext of proposed agreements.    While others attempted to resolve the tense situation by hacking at the leaves, Sadat drew upon his earlier centering experience in a lonely prison cell and went to work on the r oot.  And in doing so, he \nchanged the course of hist ory for millions of people. \n   He records in his autobiography:    It was then that I drew, almo st unconsciously, on the inner stre ngth I had developed in Cell 54 of \nCairo Central Prison -- a strength, call it a talent or  capacity, for change.  I fo und that I faced a highly \nT H E  S E V E N  H A B I T S  O F  H I G H L Y  E F F E C T I V E  P E O P L E                                     B r o u g h t  t o  y o u  b y  F l y H e a r t  \ncomplex situation, and that I couldn't hope to chan ge it until I had armed myself with the necessary \npsychological and intellectual capacity.  My contemplation of life and human nature in that secluded place had taught me that he who cannot change the very fabric of his thought will never be able to \nchange reality, and will never, therefore, make any progress.    Change -- real change -- comes from the Inside-Out.  It doesn't co me from hacking at the leaves of \nattitude and behavior with quick-fix personality ethic techniques.  It comes from striking at the root -- \nthe fabric of our thought, the fundamental, essentia l paradigms, which give definition to our character \nand create the lens through which we s ee the world.  In the words of Amiel: \n   Moral truth can be conceived in thought.  One ca n have feelings about it.  One can will to live it.  \nBut moral truth may have been penetrated and possesse d in all these ways, and escape us still.  Deeper \neven than consciousness there is ou r being itself -- our very substance,  our nature.  Only those truths \nwhich have entered into this last region, which have become ourselves, become spontaneous and \ninvoluntary as well as voluntary, unconscious as well as  conscious, are really our life -- that is to say, \nsomething more than property.  So long as we are  able to distinguish any space whatever between \nTruth and us we remain outside it.  The thought, the feeling, the desire or th e consciousness of life may \nnot be quite life.  To become divine  is then the aim of life.  Then on ly can truth be said to be ours \nbeyond the possibility of loss.  It is no longer outsid e us, nor in a sense even in us, but we are it, and it \nis we.    Achieving unity -- oneness -- with ourselves, with our loved ones, with our friends and working \nassociates, is the highest and best and most delicious fruit of the Seven Habits.  Most of us have tasted \nthis fruit of true unity from time to time in the pa st, as we have also tasted the bitter, lonely fruit of \ndisunity -- and we know how precious and fragile unity is.    Obviously building character of total integrity and li ving the life of love and service that creates such \nunity isn't easy.  It isn't quick fix.    But it's possible.  It begins with the desire to center our lives on correct principles, to break out of \nthe paradigms created by other centers an d the comfort zones of unworthy habits. \n   Sometimes we make mistakes, we feel awkward.  But if we start with the Daily Private Victory and \nwork from the Inside-Out, the resu lts will surely come.  As we plant the seed and patiently weed and \nnourish it, we begin to feel the excitement of re al growth and eventually taste the incomparably \ndelicious fruits of a congruent, effective life.",

A tendency that's run through your family for generations can stop with you.  You're a transition \nperson -- a link between the past and the future.  And your own change can affect many, many lives \ndownstream.    One powerful transition person of  the twentieth century, Anwar Sadat, left us as part of his legacy a \nprofound understanding of the nature of change.  Sadat stood between a past that had created a \"huge \nwall of suspicion, fear, hate and misunderstanding \" between Arabs and Israe lis, and a future in which \nincreased conflict and isolation seemed inevitable.  Ef forts at negotiation had been met with objections \non every scale -- even to formalities and procedural points, to an insignificant comma or period in the \ntext of proposed agreements.    While others attempted to resolve the tense situation by hacking at the leaves, Sadat drew upon his earlier centering experience in a lonely prison cell and went to work on the r oot.  And in doing so, he \nchanged the course of hist ory for millions of people. \n   He records in his autobiography",
