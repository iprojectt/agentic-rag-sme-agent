This question can be \nbeneficial in deciding if your goal is realistic. For example, if the goal is to open a baking \nbusiness, but you’ve never baked anything before, t hat might be an issue. As a result, \nyou may refine the specifics of the goal to be “Learn how to bake in order to open a \nbaking business.\"  \n Why – What is the reason for the goal?

This makes a goal more \ntangible because it provides a way to measure progress. If it’s a project that’s goi ng to take a \nfew months to complete, then set some milestones by considering specific tasks to accomplish. \nMilestones are a series of steps along the way that when added up will result in the completion \nof your main goal.  \n As the “M” in SMART states, there should be a source of information to measure or \ndetermine whether a goal has been achieved.  \n The M is a direct (or possibly indirect) indicator of what success for a particular goal will \nlook like.  \n Sometimes measurement is dif ficult and managers  and employe es will need to work \ntogether to identify the most relevant and feasible data sources and collection methods.  \n Data collection efforts needed to measure a goal can be  included in that goal’s action  \nplan.  \n Even if a perfect, direct measurement source is not im mediately feasible for a given \ngoal, the discussion about the desired end result (why this goal is important) and what \nthe measurement options are (what success might look like) is an important and \nvaluable part of performance planning.  \n Measurement methods  can be both quantitative  (productivity results , money saved or \nearned, etc .) and qualitative  (client testimonials, surveys, etc.) . \n  \nPerformance Appraisal Planning 2016 -2017    SMART Goals: A How to  Guide  \n \n \n6 \n  \n Some typical data types and data collection methods may include:  \n \nDATA TYPES  DATA COLLECTION METHODS  \nQuality/accuracy ra tes Automated reports  \nAmounts produced  Audits, tests  \nRevenue generated  Surveys  \nProductivity rates  Work products, samples  \nCustomer Satisfaction  Other documents  \n \nA – Achievable  \nThis focuses on how important a goal is to you and what you can do to make it attainable and \nmay require developing new skills and changing attitudes.
