The first thing we have to d o (after \nwe've collected the in-basket) is make sure all the ir hardware \nand software are working. Then we clean up (print o ut and \nerase, usually) everything they have previously tri ed to organize \nin their Outlook task lists and put it all into \"in .\" Then we estab- \nlish some working categories such as \"Calls,\" \"Erra nds,\" \"Agen- \ndas,\" \"At Computer,\" and so on.

Maybe you've just come back from an off-s ite meeting \nand have to be on a long conference call in fifteen  minutes. So \nyou check to make sure there are no land mines abou t to explode \nand to see if your client has e-mailed you back OK' ing the big \nproposal. \nBut that's not processing your in-basket; it's emer gency \nscanning. When you're in processing mode, you must get into the \nhabit of starting at one end and just cranking thro ugh items one \nat a time, in order. As soon as you break that rule , and process only \nwhat you feel like processing, and in whatever order, you'll inva ri- \nably begin to leave things unprocessed. Then you wi ll no longer \nhave a functioning funnel, and it will back up all over your desk \nand office. \n122 Process does \nnot mean \"spend \ntime on.\" \nCHAPTER 6  |  PROCESSING: GETTING \"IN\" TO EMPTY \nLIFOorFIFO? \nTheoretically, you should flip your in-basket upsid e down and \nprocess first the first thing that came in. As long  as you go from \none end clear through to the other within a reasona ble period of \ntime, though, it won't make much difference. You're\ngoing to see it all in short order anyway.

And you're going to make a firm next-action d ecision about \nCHAPTER 6  |  PROCESSING: GETTING \"IN\" TO EMPTY \neach one. This may sound easy—and it is—but \nit \nrequires you to do some fast, hard thinking. Much o f \nthe time the action will not be self-evident; it wi ll \nneed to be determined. \nOn that first item, for example, do you need to \ncall someone? Fill something out? Get information \nfrom the Web? Buy something at the store? Talk to \nyour secretary? E-mail your boss? What? If there's an \naction, its specific nature will determine the next  set \nof options. But what if you say, \"There's really no th- \ning to do with this\"? I am rather like a \nmosquito in a \nnudist camp; I \nknow what I want \nto do, but I don't \nknow where to \nbegin. \n—Stephen Bayne \nWhat If There Is No Action? \nIt's likely that a portion of your in-basket will r equire no action. \nThere will be three types of things in this categor y: \n• Trash \n• Items to incubate \n• Reference material \nTrash \nIf you've been following my suggestions, you'll no doubt already \nhave tossed out a big pile of stuff. It's also like ly that you will have \nput stacks of material into \"in\" that include thing s you don't need \nanymore. So don't be surprised if there's still a l ot more to throw \naway as you process your stuff. \nProcessing all the things in your world will make y ou more \nconscious of what you are going to do and what you should not be \ndoing. One director of a foundation I worked with d iscovered that \nhe had allowed way too many e-mails (thousands!) to  accumulate—\ne-mails that in fact he wasn't ever going to respon d to anyway. He \ntold me that using my method forced him to \"go on a  healthy \ndiet\" about what he would allow to hang around his world as an \nincompletion. \nIt's likely that at some point you'll come up again st the question \n125 \n126 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY I  PART TWO \nof whether or not to keep something for future refe rence. I have \ntwo ways of dealing with that: \n• When in doubt, throw it out. \n• When in doubt, keep it. \nTake your pick. I think either approach is fine. Yo u just need to \ntrust your intuition and be realistic about your sp ace. Most people \nhave some angst about all of this because their sys tems have never \nreally been totally functional and clear-edged befo re. If you make \na clean distinction between what's reference and su pplies and \nwhat requires action, and if your reference system is simple and \nworkable, you can easily keep as much material as y ou can accom- \nmodate. Since no action is required on it, it's jus t a matter of \nphysical space and logistics. \nFiling experts can offer you more detailed guidelin es about \nall this, and your CPA can provide record-retention  timetables \nthat will tell you how long you should keep what ki nds of docu- \nmentation. My suggestion is that you make the disti nction about \nwhether something is actionable or not. Once it's c lear that no \naction is needed, there's room for lots of options.\nIncubate \nThere will probably be things in your in-basket abo ut which you \nwill say to yourself, \"There's nothing to do on thi s now, but there \nmight be later.\" Examples of this would be: \n• A flier announcing a chamber of commerce breakfast with a \nguest speaker you might want to hear",

I'll elaborate on  these in more \ndetail in the next chapter, on organizing.

Use it temporarily \nduring this initial processing to gather things to organize later. Afterward you \ncan use it to hold pending work-in-progress papers and physical reminders of \nnext actions. \n127 \n128 PRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY  |  PART TWO \n4ft \nand topics. Ideally, you have already set up a work able filing system \n(as described in chapter 4) for your reference and support infor- \nmation. As you come across material in your in-bask et and e-mail \nthat you'd like to keep for archival or support pur poses, file it. \nYou'll probably discover that there are lots of mis cellaneous \nkinds of things that you want to keep but have pile d up in stacks \nor stuffed into drawers because your reference syst em was too for- \nmal or just plain nonexistent. Let me remind you he re that a less- \nthan-sixty-second, fun-to-use general-reference fil ing system \nwithin arm's reach of where you sit is a mission-cr itical compo- \nnent of full implementation of this methodology. In  the \"battle \nzone\" of real life, if it's not easy, fast, and fun  to file, you'll stack \ninstead of organizing. And then it will become much  more diffi- \ncult to keep things processed. \nWhenever you come across something you want to keep , \nmake a label for it, put it in a file folder, and t uck that into your fil- \ning drawer. Or put a Post-it on it instructing your  secretary or \nassistant to do the same. In my early days of coach ing I used to \ngive my clients permission to keep a \"To File\" pile . No longer. I \ndiscovered that if you can't get it into your syste m immediately, \nyou're probably not ever going to. If you won't do it now, you \nlikely won't do it later, either. \nAnd If There Is an Action . . . What Is It? \nThis is the biggie. If there's something that needs  to be done \nabout the item in \"in,\" then you need to decide wha t exactly \nthat next action is. \"Next Actions\" again, means th e next physical, \nvisible activity that would be required to move the  situation toward \nclosure. \nThis is both easier and more difficult than it soun ds. \nThe next action should be easy to figure out, but there are \noften some quick analyses and several planning step s that haven't",

Many people \nthink they've determined the \"next action\" when the y get it down \nto \"set meeting.\" But that's not the next action, \nbecause it's not descriptive of physical behavior. How \ndo you set a meeting? Well, it could be with a phon e \ncall or an e-mail, but to whom? Decide.

If you haven't identified the next physical \naction required to kick-start it, there will be a p sy- \nchological gap every time you think about it even \nvaguely. You'll tend to resist noticing it. \nWhen you get to a phone or to your computer, you wa nt to \nhave all your thinking completed so you can use the  tools you \nhave and the location you're in to more easily get things done, \nhaving already defined what there is to do. \nWhat if you say to yourself, \"Well, the next thing I need to \ndo is decide what to do about this?\" That's a trick y one. Deciding \nisn't really an action, because actions take time, and deciding \ndoesn't. There's always some physical activity that\ncan be done to facilitate your decision-making. \nNinety-nine percent of the time you just need more \ninformation before you can make a decision. That \nadditional  information   can  come  from  external\n130 Until you know \nwhat the next \nphysical action is, \nthere's still more \nthinking required \nbefore anything can \nhappen. \nDetermine what you \nneed to do in order \nto decide. \nCHAPTER 6  |  PROCESSING: GETTING \"IN\" TO EMPTY \nsources (\"Call Susan to get her input on the propos al\") or from \ninternal thinking (\"Draft ideas about new reorganiz ation\"). \nEither way, there's still a next action to be deter mined in order to \nmove the project forward. \nOnce You Decide What the Action Step is \nYou have three options once you decide what the nex t action \nreally is. \n• Do it (if the action takes less than two minutes). \n• Delegate it (if you're not the most appropriate person to do th e \naction). \n• Defer it into your organization system as an option for work  to \ndo later. \nDo It\nIf the next action can be done in two minutes or le ss, do it",

That \nwould have been OK if he were twenty-six, when ever ything's an \nadrenaline rush anyway, but he was in his thirties and had young \nkids. Working all weekend was no longer acceptable behavior. \nWhen I coached him we went through all 800-plus e-m ails he \ncurrently had in \"in.\" It turned out that a lot cou ld be dumped, \nquite a few needed to be filed as reference, and ma ny others \nrequired less-than-two-minute replies that he whipp ed through. I \nchecked with him a year later, and he was still cur rent! He never \nlet his e-mails mount up beyond a screenful anymore . He said it \nhad changed the nature of his division because of t he dramatic \ndecrease in his own response time.

If you hav e a long \nopen window of time in which to process your in-bas ket, you can \nextend the cutoff for each item to five or ten minu tes. If you've got \nto get to the bottom of all your input rapidly, in order to figure out \nhow best to use your afternoon, then you may want t o shorten the \ntime to one minute, or even thirty seconds, so you can get through \neverything a little faster. \nIt's not a bad idea to time yourself for a few of t hese while \nyou're becoming familiar with the process.

The rationale fo r the two-minute \nrule is that that's more or less the point where it  starts taking \nlonger to store and track an item than to deal with  it the first time \nit's in your hands-—in other words, it's the effici ency cutoff. If the \nthing's not important enough to be done, throw it away. If it is, \nand if you're going to do it sometime, the efficien cy factor should \ncome into play. \nMany people find that getting into the habit of fol lowing the \ntwo-minute rule creates a dramatic improvement in t heir produc- \ntivity. One vice president of a large software comp any told me \n131 \nPRACTICING STRESS-FREE PRODUCTIVITY |  PART TWO \nthat it gave him an additional hour a day of qualit y discretionary \ntime!

You may decide , \"This \nhas got to get over to Customer Service,\" or \"My bo ss needs to \nput his eyes on this next,\" or \"I need my partner's  point of view on \nthis.\" \nA \"systematic format\" could be any of the following : \n• Send the appropriate party an e-mail. \n• Write a note or an overnote on paper and route the item \"out\" \nto that person. \n• Leave him or her a voice-mail. \n• Add it as an agenda item on a list for your next re al-time \nconversation with that person. \n• Talk to him or her directly, either face-to-face or  by phone. \nAlthough any of these options can work, I would rec om- \nmend them in the above order, top to bottom. E-mail  is usually \nthe fastest mode into the system; it provides an el ectronic record; \nand the receiver gets to deal with it at his or her  convenience. \nWritten notes are next because they too can get int o the system \nimmediately, and the recipient then has a physical particle to use \nas an organizational reminder. If you're passing on  paper-based \nmaterial as part of the handoff, a written communic ation is obvi- \nously the way to go; as with e-mail, the person you  hand it off to \ncan then deal with it on his or her own schedule. V oice-mail can \nbe efficient, and many professionals live by it; th e downside is that \ntracking becomes an additional requirement for both  you and the \nrecipient, and what you say is not always what gets  heard. Next \nwould be saving the communication on an agenda list  or in a \nfolder for your next regular meeting with the perso n. Sometimes \nthis is necessary because of the sensitive or detai led nature of the \ntopic, but it then must wait to get moving until th at meeting \noccurs. The least preferable option would be to int errupt what \nboth you and the person are doing to talk about the  item. This is \nimmediate, but it hampers workflow for both of you and has the \nsame downside as voice-mail: no written record. \nCHAPTER 6  I  PROCESSING: GETTING \"IN\" TO EMPTY \nTracking the Handoff If you do delegate an action to someone \nelse, and if you care at all whether something happ ens as a result, \nyou'll need to track it.

You'll also wind up with \na stack of items that have actions associated with them that you \nstill need to do—soon, someday, or on a specific da te—and \nreminders of things you're waiting on from other pe ople. This \n\"Pending\" group is made up of the actions you've de legated or \ndeferred.

There's still going to be something about \"car alarm\" to \nCHAPTER 6  |  PROCESSING: GETTING \"IN\" TO EMPTY \ndo after the call to Frank, and there will still be  something to han- \ndle about the conference after the e-mail to Bernad ette. \nI hope you're able to see the very practical reason  for defining \nprojects as broadly as I do: If the action step you 've identified will \nnot complete the commitment, then you'll need \nsome stake in the ground to keep reminding you \nof actions you have pending",
