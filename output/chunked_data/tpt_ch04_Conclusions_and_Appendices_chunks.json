It’s precisely by breaking and inverting our dependency on \nbecoming  t h a t  a  d i f f e r e n t  v i s i o n  o f  t i m e  e m e r g e s .

In more general terms, this stimulates the  \nvital contact you need to assert yourself and at the same time accomplish activities. \nThe passage of time is no longer perceived as negative, but positive. Every Pomodoro \nrepresents the opportunity to im prove, or in crisis situations, to rapidly reorganize. The more \ntime passes, the better chance you have to improve your process. The more time passes, the \nmore easily activities can be estimated and scheduled. The more time passes, the more the \nfeeling of anxiety is assuaged, and in its pla ce come enhanced consciousness, sharper focus on \nthe here and now, and a clearer mind in deciding your next move. The result is higher \nproductivity. \nMoreover, the same dependency inversion mechanism is applied in the Pomodoro \nTechnique to reduce and eliminate interruptions. Th is increases concentrat ion and continuity in \nwork, and here too there is a considerable correlated rise in productivity. \n4.2 Regulating Complexity \nWe can maximize our motivation by accomplishing several challenging activities every day that \nare neither too complex nor too easy, simply by applying the following rules:  \n! If It Lasts More Than 5-7 Pomodoros, Break It Down. \n! If It Lasts Less Than One Pomodoro, Add It Up. \nLess complex activities are usually easier to estimate, so quantitative estimates \nimprove. Breaking down activities so they deliver incremental value also bolsters our \ndetermination to attain our objectives. \n4.3 Detachment \nFrequent breaks with the Pomodoro are essential to achieving more lucid, conscious and \neffective mental capacity with a resulting increase in productivity.

With the Pomodoro Technique, you get used to stopping and disengaging from continual \nwork situations that don’t improve individual or team effectiveness. Stopping, detaching, and \nobserving yourself from the outside enhances awareness of your behavior. Stopping becomes \nsynonymous with strength, not weakness. \n4.4 Observation and Continual Feedback \nThe Pomodoro Technique represents a method of  comparison every 25 minutes. The first and \nlast five minutes of a Pomodoro, which serve to review and repeat what you’ve done, already \nenable you to realize if a certain course of action is effective. Pair work magnifies this positive \nphenomenon more than individual or group work. In the most critical cases, it’s even possible to \nchange direction from the very next Pomodoro, rescheduling the activities that need to be done. \n R e c o r d i n g  d a t a  a t  l e a s t  o n c e  a  d a y ,  w i t h  tracking every 30 minutes, lets us assess the \neffectiveness of our modus operandi  o n  t h e  b a s i s  o f  o b j e c t i v e  m e t r i c s .  B y  o b s e r v i n g  w h a t  \nyou’ve recorded, you can come to a decision to modify your process, improving the content of \nactivities, defining clearer objectives or breaking down activities, identifying and eliminating \nduplicated or unnecessary activity or phases, testing alternative strategies for assembling \nactivities while reducing error in qualitative estimates. \n T h e  c h a n c e  t o  d i r e c t l y  a f f e c t  y o u r  w o r k  o r  s t u d y  p r o c e s s  b y  s t e e r i n g  i t  t o w a r d  \nimprovement stimulates your personal interest in accomplishing activities by asserting yourself.  \n4.5 Sustainable Pace \nRespecting the timetable for work and breaks cont ributes to achieving continuity. To guarantee \nconsistently high productivity, in fact, it’s not e ffective to make yourself work or study non-stop \nfrom morning till night.

A Pomodoro Consists of 25 minutes Plus a Five-Minute Break (§2.1).   \n! After Every Four Pomodoros Comes a 15-30 Minute Break (§2.1.2). \n! The Pomodoro Is Indivisible. There are no half or quarter Pomodoros (§2.1). \n! If a Pomodoro Begins, It Has to Ring:  \n! If a Pomodoro is interrupted definitively – i.e. the interruption isn’t handled \n(§2.2.2) – it’s considered void, never begun, and it can’t be recorded with an X \n(§2.1.1). \n! If an activity is completed once a Pomodoro has already begun, continue reviewing \nthe same activity until the Pomodoro rings (§2.1.3). \n! Protect the Pomodoro (§2.2.3). Inform effectively, negotiate quickly to reschedule the \ninterruption, call back the person who interrupted you as agreed. \n! If It Lasts More Than 5-7 Pomodoros, Break It Down (§2.3, §3.11, §4.2). Complex \nactivities should be divided into several activities. \n! If It Lasts Less Than One Pomodoro, Add It Up (§2.3, §4.2). Simple tasks can be \ncombined. \n! Results Are Achieved Pomodoro after Pomodoro (§3.8). \n! The Next Pomodoro Will Go Better (§3.9). \n \nGlossary \n! Pomodoro . Kitchen timer used to measure 25-minute intervals.
