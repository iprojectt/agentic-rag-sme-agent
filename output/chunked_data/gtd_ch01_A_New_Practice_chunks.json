In just the last hal f of \nthe twentieth century, what constituted \"work\" in t he \nindustrialized world was transformed from assembly-\nline, make-it and move-it kinds of activity to what\nPeter Drucker has so aptly termed \"knowledge work.\"\nIn the old days, work was self-evident. Fields \nwere to be plowed, machines tooled, boxes packed, \ncows milked, widgets cranked. You knew what work ha d to be \ndone—you could see it. It was clear when the work w as finished, \nor not finished. \nNow, for many of us, there are no edges to most of our proj- \nects. Most people I know have at least half a dozen  things they're \ntrying to achieve right now, and even if they had t he \nrest of their lives to try, they wouldn't be able t o finish \nthese to perfection. You're probably faced with the\nsame dilemma. How good could that conference \npotentially be? How effective could the training pr o- \ngram be, or the structure of your executives' compe n- \nsation package? How inspiring is the essay you're \nwriting? How motivating the staff meeting? How \nfunctional the reorganization? And a last question:\nHow much available data could be relevant to doing those proj- \nects \"better\"? The answer is, an infinite amount, e asily accessible, \nor at least potentially so, through the Web. \nOn another front, the lack of edges can create more work \n5Time is the \nquality of nature \nthat keeps events \nfrom happening all \nat once. Lately it \ndoesn't seem to be \nworking. \n—Anonymous \nAlmost every \nproject could be \ndone better, and an \ninfinite quantity of\ninformation is now \navailable that could \nmake that happen.\nTHE ART OF GETTING THINGS DONE  I  PART ONE \nfor everyone.

The ability to be successful, relaxed, a nd in \ncontrol  during these  fertile  but turbulent times\ndemands new ways of thinking and working. There \nis a great need for new methods, technologies, and \nwork habits to help us get on top of our world. \nThe traditional approaches to time management and p er- \nsonal organization were useful in their time. They provided help- \nful reference points for a workforce that was just emerging from \nan industrial assembly-line modality into a new kin d of work that \nincluded choices about what to do and discretion ab out when to \ndo it. When \"time\" itself turned into a work factor , personal cal- \nendars became a key work tool. (Even as late as the  1980s many \nprofessionals considered having a pocket Day-Timer the essence \nof being organized, and many people today think of their calendar \nas the central tool for being in control.) Along wi th discretionary \ntime also came the need to make good choices about what to do. \n\"ABC\" priority codes and daily \"to-do\" lists were k ey techniques \n7The burner I go, \nthe behinder I get. \n—Anonymous \nThe winds and \nwaves are always \non the side of the \nablest navigators. \n—Edward Gibbon \n8THE ART OF GETTING THINGS DONE | PART ONE \nthat people developed to help them sort through the ir choices in \nsome meaningful way. If you had the freedom to deci de what to \ndo, you also had the responsibility to make good ch oices, given \nyour \"priorities.\" \nWhat you've probably discovered, at least at some l evel, is \nthat a calendar, though important, can really effec tively manage \nonly a small portion of what you need to organize. And daily \nto-do lists and simplified priority coding have pro ven inadequate \nto deal with the volume and variable nature of the average profes- \nsional's workload. More and more people's jobs are made up of \ndozens or even hundreds of e-mails a day, with no l atitude left to \nignore a single request, complaint, or order. There  are few people \nwho can (or even should) expect to code everything an \"A,\" a \"B,\" \nor a \"C\" priority, or who can maintain some predete rmined list of \nto-dos that the first telephone call or interruptio n from their boss \nwon't totally undo. \nThe \"Big Picture\" vs. the Nitty-Gritty \nAt the other end of the spectrum, a huge number of business \nbooks, models, seminars, and gurus have championed the \"bigger \nview\" as the solution to dealing with our complex w orld. Clarify- \ning major goals and values, so the thinking goes, g ives order, \nmeaning, and direction to our work.

Yo u \ncan experience what the martial artists call a \"mind \nlike water\" and top athletes refer to as the \"zone, \" \nwithin the complex world in which you're engaged. \nIn fact, you have probably already been in this sta te \nfrom time to time. \nIt's a condition of working, doing, and being in \nwhich the mind is clear and constructive things are\nhappening. It's a state that is accessible by every one, \nand one that is increasingly needed to deal effecti vely \nwith the complexity of life in the twenty-first cen tury. \nMore and more it will be a required condition for \nhigh-performance professionals who wish to maintain\nbalance and a consistent positive output in their w ork. \nWorld-class rower Craig Lambert has described how \nit feels in Mind Over Water (Houghton Miffin, 1998): \n10 Rowers have a word for this frictionless state: swi ng. . . . Recall \nthe pure joy of riding on a backyard swing: an easy  cycle of \nmotion, the momentum coming from the swing itself. The swing \ncarries us; we do not force it. We pump our legs to  drive our arc \nhigher, but gravity does most of the work. We are n ot so much \nswinging as being swung. The boat swings you. The s hell wants \nto move fast: Speed sings in its lines and nature. Our job is \nsimply to work with the shell, to stop holding it b ack with our \nthrashing struggles to go faster. Trying too hard s abotages boat \nspeed. Trying becomes striving and striving undoes itself Social \nclimbers strive to be aristocrats but their efforts  prove them no \nsuch thing. Aristocrats do not strive; they have al ready arrived. \nSwing is a state of arrival. \nThe \"Mind Like Water\" Simile \nIn karate there is an image that's used to define t he position of \nperfect readiness: \"mind like water.\" Imagine throw ing a pebble \ninto a still pond. How does the water respond? The answer is, \nCHAPTER 1  I A NEW PRACTICE FOR A NEW REALITY \ntotally appropriately to the force and mass of the \ninput; then it returns to calm.

Even those who are not consciously \"stresse d out\" will \ninvariably experience greater relaxation, better fo cus, and \nincreased productive energy when they learn more ef fectively to \ncontrol the \"open loops\" of their lives. \nYou've probably made many more agreements with your self \nthan you realize, and every single one of them-big or little—is \nbeing tracked by a less-than-conscious part of you.  These are the \n\"incompletes,\" or \"open loops,\" which I define as a nything pulling \nat your attention that doesn't belong where it is, the way it is. \nOpen loops can include everything from really big t o-do items \nlike \"End world hunger\" to the more modest \"Hire ne w assistant\" \nto the tiniest task such as \"Replace electric penci l sharpener.\" \nIt's likely that you also have more internal commit ments cur- \nrently in play than you're aware of. Consider how m any things you \nfeel even the smallest amount of responsibility to \nchange, finish, handle, or do something about. You \nhave a commitment, for instance, to deal in some \nway with every new communication landing in your \ne-mail, on your voice-mail, and in your in-basket. \nAnd surely there are numerous projects that you \nsense need to be defined in your areas of responsi-\nbility, as well as goals and directions to be clari fied, a \ncareer to be managed, and life in general to be kep t in balance. \nYou have accepted some level of internal responsibi lity for every- \n12 Anything that does \nnot belong where it \nis, the way it is, is \nan \"open loop\" \npulling on your \nattention. \nCHAPTER 1  ",

Anything \nyou consider unfinished in any way must be captured  in a trusted \nsystem outside your mind, or what I call a collecti on bucket, that \nyou know you'll come back to regularly and sort thr ough. \n• Second, you must clarify exactly what your commitme nt is and \ndecide what you have to do, if anything, to make pr ogress \ntoward fulfilling it. \n• Third, once you've decided on all the actions you n eed to take, \nyou must keep reminders of them organized in a syst em you \nreview regularly. \nAn Important Exercise to Test This Model \nI suggest that you write down the project or situation that is most on\nyour mind at this moment. What most \"bugs\" you, distracts you, or \ninterests you, or in some other way consumes a larg e part of your \nconscious attention? It may be a project or problem  that is really \n\"in your face,\" something you are being pressed to handle, or a \nsituation you feel you must deal with sooner rather  than later. \nMaybe you have a vacation trip coming up that you n eed to \nmake some major last-minute decisions about. Or per haps you \njust inherited six million dollars and you don't kn ow what to do \nwith the cash. Whatever. \n13 \nTHE ART OF GETTING THINGS DONE I PART ONE \nGot it? Good. Now describe, in a single written sen tence, \nyour intended successful outcome for this problem o r situation. \nIn other words, what would need to happen for you t o check \nthis \"project\" off as \"done\"? It could be as simple  as \"Take the \nHawaii vacation,\" \"Handle situation with customer X ,\" \"Resolve \ncollege situation with Susan,\" \"Clarify new divisio nal manage- \nment structure,\" or \"Implement new investment strat egy.\" All \nclear? Great. \nNow write down the very next physical action required to move \nthe situation forward. If you had nothing else to do in your life but \nget closure on this, where would you go right now, and what visi- \nble action would you take? Would you pick up a phon e and make \na call? Go to your computer and write an e-mail? Si t down with \npen and paper and brainstorm about it? Talk face-to -face with \nyour spouse, your secretary, your attorney, or your  boss? Buy nails \nat the hardware store? What? \nGot the answer to that? Good. \nWas there any value for you in these two minutes of  think- \ning? If you're like the vast majority of people who  complete that \ndrill during my seminars, you'll be experiencing at\nleast a tiny bit of enhanced control, relaxation, a nd \nfocus. You'll also be feeling more motivated to act u- \nally do something about that situation you've merely \n     been thinking about till now. Imagine that mot iva- \ntion magnified a thousandfold, as a way to live and\nwork. \nIf anything at all positive happened for you in thi s little exer- \ncise, think about this: What changed?

What probably happened is that you ac quired a clearer \ndefinition of the outcome desired and the next acti on required. \nBut what created that? The answer is, thinking.

We're never really taught that  we have to \nthink about our work before we can do it; much of o ur daily \nactivity is already defined for us by the undone an d unmoved \nthings staring at us when we come to work, or by th e family to be \nfed, the laundry to be done, or the children to be dressed at home. \nThinking in a concentrated manner to define desired  outcomes is \nsomething few people feel they have to do. But in t ruth, outcome \nthinking is one of the most effective means availab le for making \nwishes reality. \nWhy Things Are on Your Mind \nMost often, the reason something is \"on your mind\" is that you \nwant it to be different than it currently is, and y et: \n• you haven't clarified exactly what the intended out come is; \n• you haven't decided what the very next physical act ion step is; \nand/or \n• you haven't put reminders of the outcome and the ac tion \nrequired in a system you trust. \n15 The ancestor of \nevery action is a \nthought. \n—Ralph \nWaldo \nTHE ART OF GETTING THINGS DONE  I  PART ONE \nThat's why it's on your mind. Until those thoughts have \nbeen clarified and those decisions made, and the re sulting data \nhas been stored in a system that you absolutely know \nyou will think about as often as you need to, your \nbrain can't give up the job. You can fool everyone \nelse, but you can't fool your own mind. It knows \nwhether or not you've come to the conclusions you \nneed to, and whether you've put the resulting out- \ncomes and action reminders in a place that can be \ntrusted to resurface appropriately within your con-\nscious mind. If you haven't done those things, it \nwon't quit working overtime. Even if you've already\ndecided on the next step you'll take to resolve a p rob- \nlem, your mind can't let go until and unless you wr ite yourself \na reminder in a place it knows you will, without fail, look. It \nwill keep pressuring you about that untaken next st ep, usually \nwhen you can't do anything about it, which will jus t add to your \nstress. \n16 Your Mind Doesn't Have a Mind of Its Own \nAt least a portion of your mind is really kind of s tupid, in an interest- \ning way. If it had any innate intelligence, it woul d remind you of the \nthings you needed to do only when you could do something about them. \nDo you have a flashlight somewhere with dead batter ies in \nit? When does your mind tend to remind you that you  need new \nbatteries? When you notice the dead ones! That's no t very smart. \nIf your mind had any innate intelligence, it would remind you \nabout those dead batteries only when you passed liv e ones in a \nstore. And ones of the right size, to boot. \nBetween the time you woke up today and now, did you  think \nof anything you needed to do that you still haven't  done? Have \nyou had that thought more than once? Why? It's a wa ste of time \nand energy to keep thinking about something that yo u make no \nprogress on. And it only adds to your anxieties abo ut what you \nshould be doing and aren't. This constant, \nunproductive \npreoccupation with \nall the things we \nhave to do is the \nsingle largest \nconsumer of time \nand energy. \n—Kerry \nCHAPTER 1  [ A NEW PRACTICE FOR A NEW REALITY \nIt seems that most people let",
