You will never be caught up. You will always be behind\nin some of your tasks and responsibilities, and probably in many of\nthem.\nThe Need to Be Selective\nFor this reason, and perhaps more than ever before, your ability to\nselect your most important task at each moment, and then to get\nstarted on that task and to get it done both quickly and well, will\nprobably have more of an impact on your success than any other\nquality or skill you can develop.\nAn average person who develops the habit of setting clear priorities\nand getting important tasks completed quickly will run circles\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 10around a genius who talks a lot and makes wonderful plans but who\ngets very little done.\nThe Truth about Frogs\nMark Twain once said that if the first thing you do each morning is to\neat a live frog, you can go through the day with the satisfaction of\nknowing that that is probably the worst thing that is going to happen\nto you all day long.\nYour \"frog\" is your biggest, most important task, the one you are\nmost likely to procrastinate on if you don't do something about it.It is also the one task that can have the greatest positive impact on\nyour life and results at the moment.\nThe first rule of frog-eating is: \"If you have to eat two frogs, eat the\nugliest one first.\"\nThis is another way of saying that, if you have two important tasks\nbefore you, start with the biggest, hardest and most important task\nfirst. Discipline yourself to begin immediately and then to persist\nuntil the task is complete before you go on to something else.\nThink of this as a “test.” Treat it like a personal challenge. Resist the\ntemptation to start with the easier task. Continually remind yourself\nthat one of the most important decisions you make each day is your\nchoice of what you will do immediately and what you will do later, if\nyou do it at all.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 11The second rule of frog-eating is: \"If you have to eat a live frog at all,\nit doesn't pay to sit and look at it for very long.\"\nThe key to reaching high levels of performance and productivity is\nfor you to develop the lifelong habit of tackling your major task firstthing each morning. You must develop the routine of \"Eating your\nfrog\" before you do anything else, and without taking too much time\nto think about it.\nTake Action Immediately\nIn study after study of men and women who get paid more and\npromoted faster, the quality of \"action orientation,\" stands out as the\nmost observable and consistent behavior they demonstrate in\neverything they do. Successful, effective people are those who launch\ndirectly into their major tasks and then discipline themselves to worksteadily and single mindedly until those tasks are complete.\nIn our world, and especially in our business world, you are paid and\npromoted for getting specific, measurable results . You are paid for\nmaking a valuable contribution and especially, for making the mostimportant contribution that is expected of you.\n\"Failure to execute\" is one of the biggest problems in organizations\ntoday. Many people confuse activity with accomplishment. They talk\ncontinually, hold endless meetings and make wonderful plans, but,\nin the final analysis, no one does the job and gets the results required.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 12Develop the Habits of Success\nYour success in life and work will be determined by the kinds of\nhabits that you develop over time. The habit of setting priorities,overcoming procrastination and getting on with your most importanttask is a mental and physical skill. As such, this habit is learnable\nthrough practice and repetition, over and over again, until it locks\ninto your subconscious mind and becomes a permanent part of yourbehavior. Once it becomes a habit, it becomes both automatic andeasy to do.\nThis habit of starting and completing important tasks has immediate\nand continuous payoff.

You are designed mentally and emotionally\nin such a way that task completion gives you a positive feeling. It\nmakes you happy. It makes you feel like a winner.\nWhenever you complete a task, of any size or importance, you feel a\nsurge of energy, enthusiasm and self-esteem. The more important the\ncompleted task, the happier, more confident and powerful you feel\nabout yourself and your world.\nImportant task completion triggers the release of endorphins in your\nbrain. These endorphins give you a natural “high.” The endorphin\nrush that follows successful completion of any task makes you feel\nmore positive, personable, creative and confident.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 13Develop a Positive Addiction\nHere is one of the most important of the so-called “secrets of\nsuccess.” It is that you can actually develop a \"positive addition\" toendorphins and to the feeling of enhanced clarity, confidence andcompetence that they trigger. When you develop this “addiction,”\nyou will, at an unconscious level, begin to organize your life in such a\nway that you are continually starting and completing ever moreimportant tasks and projects. You actually become addicted, in a verypositive sense, to success and contribution.\nOne of the keys to your living a wonderful life, having a successful\ncareer and feeling terrific about yourself is for you to develop the\nhabit of starting and finishing important jobs. At that point, this\nbehavior takes on a power of its own and you find it easier to\ncomplete important tasks than not to complete them.\nNo Short Cuts\nYou remember the story of the man who stops a musician on a street\nin New York and asks how he can get to Carnegie Hall. The musician\nreplies, \"Practice, man, practice.\"\nPractice is the key to mastering any skill. Fortunately, your mind is\nlike a muscle. It grows stronger and more capable with use. With\npractice, you can learn any behavior or develop any habit that you\nconsider either desirable or necessary.\nEAT THAT FROG!\nPAGE 14The Three D’s of New Habit Formation\nYou need three key qualities to develop the habits of focus and\nconcentration. They are all learnable. They are decision, discipline,and determination.\nFirst, make a decision  to develop the habit of task completion.\nSecond, discipline  yourself to practice the principles you are about to\nlearn over and over until they become automatic.
