By the time he was discharged to a rehabilitation center ﬁ  ve weeks later, Eugene \nwas walking down hallways and offering nurses unsolicited advice about their weekend plans.\n“I don ’t think I’ve ever seen anyone come back like this,” a doctor \ntold Beverly. “I don ’t want to raise your hopes, but this is amazing.”\nBeverly, however, remained concerned. In the rehab hospital it \nbecame clear that the disease had changed her husband in unset-tling ways. Eugene couldn ’t remember which day of the week it was, for instance, or the names of his doctors and nurses, no matter how many times they introduced themselves. “Why do they keep asking me all these questions?” he asked Beverly one day after a physician left his room. When he ﬁ  nally returned home, things got even \nstranger. Eugene didn ’t seem to remember their friends. He had trouble following conversations. Some mornings, he would get out of bed, walk into the kitchen, cook himself bacon and eggs, then climb back under the covers and turn on the radio. Forty minutes later, he would do the same thing: get up, cook bacon and eggs, climb back into bed, and ﬁ  ddle with the radio. Then he would do it \nagain.\nAlarmed, Beverly reached out to specialists, including a re-\nsearcher at the University of California, San Diego, who specialized in memory loss.

The virus had almost entirely de-stroyed his medial temporal lobe, a sliver of cells which scientists suspected was responsible for all sorts of cognitive tasks such as recall of the past and the regulation of some emotions. The com-pleteness of the destruction didn ’t surprise  Squire— viral encephali-tis consumes tissue with a ruthless, almost surgical, precision. What shocked him was how familiar the images seemed.\nThirty years earlier, as a PhD student at MIT, Squire had worked \nalongside a group studying a man known as “H.M.,” one of the most famous patients in medical history. When H.M.—his real name was Henry Molaison, but scientists shrouded his identity throughout his  life— was seven years old, he was hit by a bicycle and landed hard on his head. Soon afterward, he developed seizures and started blacking out. At sixteen, he had his ﬁ  rst grand mal seizure, \nthe kind that affects the entire brain; soon, he was losing conscious-ness up to ten times a day.\nBy the time he turned  twenty- seven, H.M. was desperate. Anti-\nconvulsive drugs hadn ’t helped. He was smart, but couldn ’t hold a job. He still lived with his parents. H.M. wanted a normal existence. So he sought help from a physician whose tolerance for experimen-tation outweighed his fear of malpractice. Studies had suggested that an area of the brain called the hippocampus  might play a role in \nseizures. When the doctor proposed cutting into H.M.’s head, lift-ing up the front portion of his brain, and, with a small straw, suck-ing out the hippocampus  and some surrounding tissue from the \ninterior of his skull, H.M. gave his consent.\nThe surgery occurred in 1953, and as H.M. healed, his seizures \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   7 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   7 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n8 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nslowed. Almost immediately, however, it became clear that his brain \nhad been radically altered. H.M. knew his name and that his mother was from Ireland. He could remember the 1929 stock market crash and news reports about the invasion of Normandy. But almost ev-erything that came  afterward— all the memories, experiences, and struggles from most of the decade before his  surgery— had been erased. When a doctor began testing H.M.’s memory by showing him playing cards and lists of numbers, he discovered that H.M. couldn ’t retain any new information for more than twenty seconds or so.\nFrom the day of his surgery until his death in 2008, every person \nH.M. met, every song he heard, every room he entered, was a com-pletely fresh experience. His brain was frozen in time. Each day, he was befuddled by the fact that someone could change the television channel by pointing a black rectangle of plastic at the screen. He introduced himself to his doctors and nurses over and over, dozens of times each day.\n“I loved learning about H.M., because memory seemed like such \na tangible, exciting way to study the brain,” Squire told me. “I grew up in Ohio, and I can remember, in ﬁ  rst grade, my teacher handing \neveryone crayons, and I started mixing all the colors together to see if it would make black. Why have I kept that memory, but I can ’t re-member what my teacher looked like? Why does my brain decide that one memory is more important than another?”\nWhen Squire received the images of Eugene’s brain, he marveled \nat how similar it seemed to H.M.’s.

Eugene, on the other hand, lived at home with his wife. H.M. couldn ’t really carry on con-versations. Eugene, in contrast, had an amazing knack for guiding almost any discussion to a topic he was comfortable talking about at length, such as  satellites— he had worked as a technician for an aerospace  company— or the weather.\nSquire started his exam of Eugene by asking him about his youth. \nEugene talked about the town where he had grown up in central California, his time in the merchant marines, a trip he had taken to Australia as a young man. He could remember most of the events in his life that had occurred prior to about 1960. When Squire asked about later decades, Eugene politely changed the topic and said he had trouble recollecting some recent events.\nSquire conducted a few intelligence tests and found that Eu-\ngene’s intellect was still sharp for a man who couldn ’t remember the last three decades. What’s more, Eugene still had all the habits he had formed in his youth, so whenever Squire gave him a cup of water or complimented him on a particularly detailed answer, Eu-gene would thank him and offer a compliment in return. Whenever someone entered the room, Eugene would introduce himself and ask about their day.\nBut when Squire asked Eugene to memorize a string of numbers \nor describe the hallway outside the laboratory’s door, the doctor found his patient couldn ’t retain any new information for more than a minute or so. When someone showed Eugene photos of his grand-children, he had no idea who they were. When Squire asked if he remembered getting sick, Eugene said he had no recollection of his illness or the hospital stay. In fact, Eugene almost never recalled that he was suffering from amnesia. His mental image of himself didn ’t include memory loss, and since he couldn ’t remember the injury, he couldn ’t conceive of anything being wrong.\nIn the months after meeting Eugene, Squire conducted experi-\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   9 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   9 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n10 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nments that tested the limits of his memory. By then, Eugene and \nBeverly had moved from Playa del Rey to San Diego to be closer to their daughter, and Squire often visited their home for his exams. One day, Squire asked Eugene to sketch a layout of his house. Eu-gene couldn ’t draw a rudimentary map showing where the kitchen or bedroom was located. “When you get out of bed in the morning, how do you leave your room?” Squire asked.\n“You know,” Eugene said, “I’m not really sure.”Squire took notes on his laptop, and as the scientist typed, Eu-\ngene became distracted. He glanced across the room and then stood up, walked into a hallway, and opened the door to the bathroom. A few minutes later, the toilet ﬂ  ushed, the faucet ran, and Eugene, \nwiping his hands on his pants, walked back into the living room and sat down again in his chair next to Squire. He waited patiently for the next question.\nAt the time, no one wondered how a man who couldn ’t draw a \nmap of his home was able to ﬁ  nd the bathroom without hesitation. \nBut that question, and others like it, would eventually lead to a trail of discoveries that has transformed our understanding of habits’ power. It would help spark a scientiﬁ  c revolution that today involves \nhundreds of researchers who are learning, for the ﬁ  rst time, to un-\nderstand all the habits that inﬂ  uence our lives.\nAs Eugene sat at the table, he looked at Squire’s laptop.“That’s amazing,” he said, gesturing at the computer. “You know, \nwhen I was in electronics, there would have been a couple of  six- foot racks holding that thing.”\n● ● ●\nIn the ﬁ  rst few weeks after they moved into their new house, Bev-\nerly tried to take Eugene outside each day. The doctors had told her that it was important for him to get exercise, and if Eugene was in-side too long he drove Beverly crazy, asking her the same questions \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   10 Duhi_978140",

Then Beverly saw a pile of pinecones on the table, like the ones she’d seen in a neighbor’s yard down the street. She came closer and looked at Eugene’s hands. His ﬁ  ngers were sticky with sap. \nThat’s when she realized that Eugene had gone for a walk by himself. He had wandered down the street and collected some souvenirs.\nAnd he had found his way home.Soon, Eugene was going for walks every morning. Beverly tried \nto stop him, but it was pointless.\n“Even if I told him to stay inside, he wouldn ’t remember a few \nminutes later,” she told me. “I followed him a few times to make sure he wouldn ’t get lost, but he always came back safely.” Some-\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   11 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   11 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n12 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\ntimes he would return with pinecones or rocks. Once he came back \nwith a wallet; another time with a puppy. He never remembered where they came from.\nWhen Squire and his assistants heard about these walks, they \nstarted to suspect that something was happening inside Eugene’s head that didn ’t have anything to do with his conscious memory. They designed an experiment. One of Squire’s assistants visited the house one day and asked Eugene to draw a map of the block where he lived. He couldn ’t do it. How about where his house was located on the street, she asked. He doodled a bit, then forgot the assign-ment. She asked him to point out which doorway led to the kitchen. Eugene looked around the room. He didn ’t know, he said. She asked Eugene what he would do if he were hungry. He stood up, walked into the kitchen, opened a cabinet, and took down a jar of nuts.\n  Later that week,   a visitor joined Eugene on his daily stroll. They \nwalked for about ﬁ  fteen minutes through the perpetual spring of \nSouthern California,   the scent of bougainvillea heavy in the air. Eu-gene didn ’t say much,   but he always led the way and seemed to know where he was going. He never asked for directions. As they rounded the corner near his house,   the visitor asked Eugene where he lived. “I don ’t know,   exactly,  ” he said. Then he walked up his sidewalk,   opened his front door,   went into the living room,   and turned on the television.\nIt was clear to Squire that Eugene was absorbing new informa-\ntion. But where inside his brain was that information residing? How could someone ﬁ  nd a jar",

If you picture the human brain as an onion, composed of layer upon layer of cells, then the outside  layers— those closest to  the scalp— are generally the most recent additions from an evolutionary perspective. When you dream up a new invention or laugh at a friend’s joke, it’s the outside parts of your brain at work. That’s where the most complex thinking occurs.\nDeeper inside the brain and closer to the brain  stem— where the \nbrain meets the spinal  column— are older, more primitive struc-tures. They control our automatic behaviors, such as breathing and swallowing, or the startle response we feel when someone leaps out from behind a bush.

This is the basal ganglia, an oval \nof cells that, for years, scientists didn ’t understand very well, except for suspicions that it played a role in diseases such as Parkinson ’s.\nIn the early 1990s, the MIT researchers began wondering if the \nbasal ganglia might be integral to habits as well. They noticed that animals with injured basal ganglia suddenly developed problems with tasks such as learning how to run through mazes or remem-bering how to open food containers. They decided to experiment by employing new  micro- technologies that allowed them to observe, in minute detail, what was occurring within the heads of rats as they performed dozens of routines. In surgery, each rat had what looked like a small joystick and dozens of tiny wires inserted into its skull. Afterward, the animal was placed into a  T- shaped maze with choco-late at one end. \nThe maze was structured so that each rat was positioned behind \na partition that opened when a loud click sounded. Initially, when a rat heard the click and saw the partition disappear, it would usually wander up and down the center aisle, snifﬁ  ng in corners and \nscratching at walls.

It didn ’t need to choose which direction to turn, and so  decision- making centers of the brain went quiet. All it had to do was recall the quickest path to the chocolate. Within a week, even the brain structures related to memory had quieted. The rat had internalized how to sprint through the maze to such a degree that it hardly needed to think at all.\nBut that  internalization— run straight, hang a left, eat the \n chocolate— relied upon the basal ganglia, the brain probes indi-cated. This tiny, ancient neurological structure seemed to take over as the rat ran faster and faster and its brain worked less and less. The basal ganglia was central to recalling patterns and acting on them. The basal ganglia, in other words, stored habits even while the rest of the brain went to sleep.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   15 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   15 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n16 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nTo see this capacity in action, consider this graph, which shows \nactivity within a rat’s skull as it encounters the maze for the ﬁ  rst \ntime.

There are  dozens— if not  hundreds— of behavioral chunks that we rely on every day. Some are simple: You automatically put toothpaste on your toothbrush before sticking it in your mouth. Some, such as getting dressed or making the kids’ lunch, are a little more complex.\nOthers are so complicated that it’s remarkable a small bit of tis-\nsue that evolved millions of years ago can turn them into habits at all",

A series of shifts slowly emerged. The rats stopped snifﬁ  ng corners and making wrong turns. Instead, \nthey zipped through the maze faster and faster. And within their brains, something unexpected occurred: As each rat learned how to navigate the maze, its mental activity decreased . As the route became \nmore and more automatic, each rat started thinking less and less.\nIt was as if the ﬁ  rst few times a rat explored the maze, its brain \nhad to work at full power to make sense of all the new information.

Take the act of backing your car out of the driveway. When you ﬁ rst learned to drive, the driveway required a major dose of concen-\ntration, and for good reason: It involves opening the garage, unlock-ing the car door, adjusting the seat, inserting the key in the ignition, turning it clockwise, moving the rearview and side mirrors and checking for obstacles, putting your foot on the brake, moving the gearshift into reverse, removing your foot from the brake, mentally estimating the distance between the garage and the street while keeping the wheels aligned and monitoring for oncoming trafﬁ  c, \ncalculating how reﬂ  ected images in the mirrors translate into actual \ndistances between the bumper, the garbage cans, and the hedges, all while applying slight pressure to the gas pedal and brake, and, most likely, telling your passenger to please stop ﬁ  ddling with the radio.\nNowadays, however, you do all of that every time you pull onto \nthe street with hardly any thought. The routine occurs by habit.\nMillions of people perform this intricate ballet every morning, \nunthinkingly, because as soon as we pull out the car keys, our basal ganglia kicks in, identifying the habit we’ve stored in our brains re-lated to backing an automobile into the street. Once that habit starts unfolding, our gray matter is free to quiet itself or chase other thoughts, which is why we have enough mental capacity to realize that Jimmy forgot his lunchbox inside.\nHabits, scientists say, emerge because the brain is constantly look-\ning for ways to save effort.

This  effort- saving instinct is a huge advan-tage. An efﬁ  cient brain requires less room, which makes for a smaller \nhead, which makes childbirth easier and therefore causes fewer in-fant and mother deaths. An efﬁ  cient brain also allows us to stop \nthinking constantly about basic behaviors, such as walking and choosing what to eat, so we can devote mental energy to inventing spears, irrigation systems, and, eventually, airplanes and video games.\nBut conserving mental effort is tricky, because if our brains \npower down at the wrong moment, we might fail to notice some-thing important, such as a predator hiding in the bushes or a speed-ing car as we pull onto the street. So our basal ganglia have devised a clever system to determine when to let habits take over. It’s some-thing that happens whenever a chunk of behavior starts or ends.\nTo see how it works, look closely at the graph of the rat’s neuro-\nlogical habit again. Notice that brain activity spikes at the beginning of the maze, when the rat hears the click before the partition starts moving, and again at the end, when it ﬁ  nds the chocolate.\nThose spikes are the brain ’s way of determining when to cede \ncontrol to a habit, and which habit to use. From behind a partition, \nClick\nFirst \nSectionSecond\nSection\nChocolate\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   18 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   18 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Habit Loop ● 19\nfor instance, it’s difﬁ  cult for a rat to know if it’s inside a familiar \nmaze or an unfamiliar cupboard with a cat lurking outside. To deal with this uncertainty, the brain spends a lot of effort at the begin-ning of a chunk of behavior looking for  something— a  cue— that offers a hint as to which habit to use. From behind a partition, if a rat hears a click, it knows to use the maze habit. If it hears a meow, it chooses a different pattern. At the end of the activity, when the reward appears, the brain shakes itself awake and makes sure every-thing unfolded as expected.\nThis process within our brains is a  three- step loop. First, there is \na cue, a trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and \nwhich habit to",

As the next two chapters explain, habits can be \nignored, changed, or replaced. But the reason the discovery of the habit loop is so important is that it reveals a basic truth: When a habit emerges, the brain stops fully participating in decision mak-ing. It stops working so hard, or diverts focus to other tasks. Unless you deliberately ﬁ ght a  habit— unless you ﬁ  nd new  routines— the \npattern will unfold automatically.\nHowever, simply understanding how habits  work— learning the \nstructure of the habit  loop— makes them easier to control. Once you break a habit into its components, you can ﬁ  ddle with the gears.\n“We’ve done experiments where we trained rats to run down a \nmaze until it was a habit, and then we extinguished the habit by changing the placement of the reward,” Ann Graybiel, a scientist at MIT who oversaw many of the basal ganglia experiments, told me. “One day, we’ll put the reward in the old place, and put in the rat, and, by golly, the old habit will reemerge right away. Habits never really disappear. They’re encoded into the structures of our brain, and that’s a huge advantage for us, because it would be awful if we had to relearn how to drive after every vacation. The problem is that your brain can ’t tell the difference between bad and good habits, and so if you have a bad one, it’s always lurking there, waiting for the right cues and rewards.”\nThis explains why it’s so hard to create exercise habits, for in-\nstance, or change what we eat. Once we develop a routine of sitting on the couch, rather than running, or snacking whenever we pass a doughnut box, those patterns always remain inside our heads. By the same rule, though, if we learn to create new neurological rou-tines that overpower those  behaviors— if we take control of the habit  loop— we can force those bad tendencies into the background, just as Lisa Allen did after her Cairo trip. And once someone creates a new pattern, studies have demonstrated, going for a jog or ignoring the doughnuts becomes as automatic as any other habit.\nWithout habit loops, our brains would shut down, overwhelmed \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   20 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   20 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Habit Loop ● 21\nby the minutiae of daily life. People whose basal ganglia are dam-\naged by injury or disease often become mentally paralyzed. They have trouble performing basic activities, such as opening a door or deciding what to eat. They lose the ability to ignore insigniﬁ  cant \n details— one study, for example, found that patients with basal gan-glia injuries couldn ’t recognize facial expressions, including fear and disgust, because they were perpetually uncertain about which part of the face to focus on. Without our basal ganglia, we lose ac-cess to the hundreds of habits we rely on every day. Did you pause this morning to decide whether to tie your left or right shoe ﬁ  rst? \nDid you have trouble ﬁ  guring out if you should brush your teeth \nbefore or after you showered?\nOf course not. Those decisions are habitual, effortless. As long as \nyour basal ganglia is intact and the cues remain constant, the behav-iors will occur unthinkingly.

Monkeys can memorize all the “correct” items after eight to ten days.\nEugene couldn ’t remember any of the “correct” items, no matter \nhow many times he did the test. He repeated the experiment twice a week for months, looking at forty pairings each day.\n“Do you know why you are here today?” a researcher asked at the \nbeginning of one session a few weeks into the experiment.\n“I don ’t think so,” Eugene said.“I’m going to show you some objects. Do you know why?”“ Am I supposed to describe them to you, or tell you what they are \nused for?” Eugene couldn ’t recollect the previous sessions at all.\nBut as the weeks passed, Eugene’s performance improved. After \n twenty- eight days of training, Eugene was choosing the “correct” ob-ject 85 percent of the time. At  thirty- six days, he was right 95 percent of the time. After one test, Eugene looked at the researcher, bewil-dered by his success.\n“How am I doing this?” he asked her.“Tell me what is going on in your head,” the researcher said. “Do \nyou say to yourself, ‘I remember seeing that one’?”\n“No,” Eugene said. “It’s here somehow or another”—he pointed \nto his head—“and the hand goes for it.”\nTo Squire, however, it made perfect sense. Eugene was exposed \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   22 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   22 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Habit Loop ● 23\nto a cue: a pair of objects always presented in the same combination. \nThere was a routine: He would choose one object and look to see if there was a sticker underneath, even if he had no idea why he felt compelled to turn the cardboard over. Then there was a reward: the satisfaction he received after ﬁ  nding a sticker proclaiming “correct.” \nEventually, a habit loop emerged.\nTo make sure this pattern was, in fact, a habit, Squire conducted \none more experiment.

Eugene’s daughter, for instance, would often stop by his house to say hello. She would talk to her father in the living room for a bit, then go into the kitchen to visit with her mother, and then leave, waving  good- bye on her way out the door. Eugene, who had forgotten their earlier conversation by the time she left, would get  angry— why was she leaving without chatting?—and then forget why he was upset. But the emotional habit had already started, and so his anger would per-sist, red hot and beyond his understanding, until it burned itself out.\n“Sometimes he would bang the table or curse, and if you asked \nhim why, he’d say ‘I don ’t know, but I’m mad!’” Beverly told me. He would kick his chair, or snap at whoever came into the room. Then, a few minutes later, he would smile and talk about the weather. “It was like, once it started, he had to ﬁ  nish the frustration,” she said.\nSquire’s new experiment also showed something else: that hab-\nits are surprisingly delicate. If Eugene’s cues changed the slightest bit, his habits fell apart. The few times he walked around the block, for instance, and something was  different— the city was doing street repairs or a windstorm had blown branches all over the  sidewalk— Eugene would get lost, no matter how close he was to home, until a kind neighbor showed him the way to his door. If his daughter stopped to chat with him for ten seconds before she walked out, his anger habit never emerged.\nSquire’s experiments with Eugene revolutionized the scientiﬁ  c \ncommunity’s understanding of how the brain works by proving, once and for all, that it’s possible to learn and make unconscious \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   24 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   24 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Habit Loop ● 25\nchoices without remembering anything about the lesson or decision \nmaking.

Eugene, who had forgotten their earlier conversation by the time she left, would get  angry— why was she leaving without chatting?—and then forget why he was upset. But the emotional habit had already started, and so his anger would per-sist, red hot and beyond his understanding, until it burned itself out.\n“Sometimes he would bang the table or curse, and if you asked \nhim why, he’d say ‘I don ’t know, but I’m mad!’” Beverly told me. He would kick his chair, or snap at whoever came into the room. Then, a few minutes later, he would smile and talk about the weather. “It was like, once it started, he had to ﬁ  nish the frustration,” she said.\nSquire’s new experiment also showed something else: that hab-\nits are surprisingly delicate. If Eugene’s cues changed the slightest bit, his habits fell apart. The few times he walked around the block, for instance, and something was  different— the city was doing street repairs or a windstorm had blown branches all over the  sidewalk— Eugene would get lost, no matter how close he was to home,",

The mice were always rewarded with food. Then, the scientists poisoned the food so that it made the animals violently ill, or electriﬁ  ed the ﬂ  oor, so that when the mice walked toward their \nreward they received a shock. The mice knew the food and cage were  dangerous— when they were offered the poisoned pellets in a bowl or saw the electriﬁ  ed ﬂ oor panels, they stayed away. When they \nsaw their old cues, however, they unthinkingly pressed the lever and ate the food, or they walked across the ﬂ  oor, even as they vomited or \njumped from the electricity. The habit was so ingrained the mice couldn ’t stop themselves.\nIt’s not hard to ﬁ  nd an analog in the human world. Consider fast \nfood, for instance. It makes  sense— when the kids are starving and you’re driving home after a long  day— to stop, just this once, at McDon ald’s or Burger King. The meals are inexpensive. It tastes so \ngood. After all, one dose of processed meat, salty fries, and sugary soda poses a relatively small health risk, right? It’s not like you do it all the time.\nBut habits emerge without our permission. Studies indicate that \nfamilies usually don ’t intend to eat fast food on a regular basis. What \nhappens is that a  once a month pattern slowly becomes once a week, and then twice a  week— as the cues and rewards create a  habit— until the kids are consuming an unhealthy amount of hamburgers and fries. When researchers at the University of North Texas and Yale tried to understand why families gradually increased their fast food consumption, they found a series of cues and rewards that most customers never knew were inﬂ  uencing their behaviors. They dis-\ncovered the habit loop.\nEvery McDonald’s, for instance, looks the  same— the company \ndeliberately tries to standardize stores’ architecture and what em-ployees say to customers, so everything is a consistent cue to trigger \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   26 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   26 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Habit Loop ● 27\npurchasing routines.

    "text": " a relatively small health risk, right? It’s not like you do it all the time.\nBut habits emerge without our permission. Studies indicate that \nfamilies usually don ’t intend to eat fast food on a regular basis. What \nhappens is that a  once a month pattern slowly becomes once a week, and then twice a  week— as the cues and rewards create a  habit— until the kids are consuming an unhealthy amount of hamburgers and fries. When researchers at the University of North Texas and Yale tried to understand why families gradually increased their fast food consumption, they found a series of cues and rewards that most customers never knew were inﬂ  uencing their behaviors. They dis-\ncovered the habit loop.\nEvery McDonald’s, for instance, looks the  same— the company \ndeliberately tries to standardize stores’ architecture and what em-ployees say to customers, so everything is a consistent cue to trigger \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   26 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   26 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:",

She discovered that she could  short- circuit some of his worst patterns by inserting new cues. If she didn ’t keep bacon in the fridge, Eugene wouldn ’t eat multiple, unhealthy break-fasts.
