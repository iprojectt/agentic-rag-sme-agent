In other words, they spend less time in\ntempting situations.\nThe people with the best self -control are typically the\nones who need to use it the least. It’s easier to practice\nself-restraint when you don’t have to use it very often.

This is one\nreason behavior change techniques can backﬁre. Shaming\nobese people with weight-loss presentations can make\nthem feel stressed, and as a result many people return to\ntheir favorite coping strategy: overeating. Showing pictures\nof blackened lungs to smokers leads to higher levels of\nanxiety , which drives many people to reach for a cigarette.\nIf you’re not careful about cues, you can cause the very\nbehavior you want to stop.\nBad habits are autocatalytic: the process feeds itself .\nThey foster the feelings they try to numb. Y ou feel bad, so\nyou eat junk food. Because you eat junk food, you feel bad.\nWatching television makes you feel sluggish, so you watch\nmore television because you don’t have the energy to do\nanything else. W orrying about your health makes you feel\nanxious, which causes you to smoke to ease your anxiety ,\nwhich makes your health even worse and soon you’re\nfeeling more anxious. It’s a downward spiral, a runaway\ntrain of bad habits.\nResearchers refer to this phenomenon as “cue-induced\nwanting”: an external trigger causes a compulsive craving\nto repeat a bad habit. Once you notice  something, you\nbegin to want  it. This process is happening all the time—\noften without us realizing it. Scientists have found that\nshowing addicts a picture of cocaine for just thirty-three\nmilliseconds stimulates the reward pathway in the brain\nand sparks desire. This speed is too fast for the brain to\nconsciously register—the addicts couldn’t even tell you\nwhat they had seen—but they craved the drug all the same.\nHere’s the punch line: Y ou can break a habit, but you’re\nunlikely to forget it. Once the mental grooves of habit have\nbeen carved into your brain, they are nearly impossible to\nremove entirely—even if they go unused for quite a while.\nAnd that means that simply resisting temptation is an\nineﬀective strategy . It is hard to maintain a Zen attitude in\na life ﬁlled with interruptions. It takes too much energy . In\nthe short-run, you can choose to overpower temptation. In\nthe long-run, we become a product of the environment that\nwe live in. T o put it bluntly , I have never seen someone\nconsistently stick to positive habits in a negative\nenvironment.\nA more reliable approach is to cut bad habits oﬀ at the\nsource. One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad\nhabit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it.\nIf you can’t seem to get any work done, leave your\nphone in another room for a few hours.\nIf you’re continually feeling like you’re not enough,\nstop following social media accounts that trigger\njealousy and envy .\nIf you’re wasting too much time watching television,\nmove the TV out of the bedroom.\nIf you’re spending too much money on electronics, quit\nreading reviews of the latest tech gear .\nIf you’re playing too many video games, unplug the\nconsole and put it in a closet after each use.\nThis practice is an inversion of the 1st Law of Behavior\nChange. R ather than make it obvious , you can make it\ninvisible . I’m often surprised by how eﬀective simple\nchanges like these can be. Remove a single cue and the\nentire habit often fades away .\nSelf-control is a short-term strategy , not a long-term one.\nYou may be able to resist temptation once or twice, but it’s\nunlikely you can muster the willpower to override your\ndesires every time. Instead of summoning a new dose of\nwillpower whenever you want to do the right thing, your\nenergy would be better spent optimizing your environment.\nThis is the secret to self -control.
