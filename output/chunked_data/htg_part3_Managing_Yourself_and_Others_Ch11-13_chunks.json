Mr. \nJackson, the director of a non-profit foundation, kept such a \nlog for a week. It showed whether these time-snatchers were \nscheduled, who they were, and what they wanted. When he \nreviewed the log he found that the 80/20 rule applied. Eighty \npercent of his interruptions were coming from 20 percent of \nthe interrupters.

Is \nyour boss (or client) giving unnecessary priority to tasks that \ncould be adequately handled on a scheduled, non-rush basis, \nand might you point this out tactfully? \nIt's also worth asking yourself whether your boss is in the \nhabit of turning to you for this type of assignment because \nyou have in effect trained him to do so. If so, try being a bit \nless available, or delegate others to handle it instead. The \nsame goes for a demanding customer. If the situation war­\nrants, you may benefit from encouraging him to call the \nservice department or some other person instead of always \ndepending on you. \nMr. Jackson's case presented no great problem. He worked \nout a schedule with his assistant to see him at three scheduled \ntimes during the day: 9:30, 1:30, and 3:30. His assistant was \nto save all business for those times, except for the most urgent \nemergencies. The assistant had gotten into the habit of \njumping up and rushing into Mr. Jackson's office like a fire­\nman whenever anything came up. In the future he was never \nto interrupt Mr. Jackson unless convinced his mission was an \nA-item. \nThe other subordinate presented a different problem. This \nman, Anderson, was insecure in his job. In order to function, \nhe needed continual reassurance that he was doing everything \nright. He was constantly bothering Mr. Jackson with a \nstream of low-priority (vague, but urgent-sounding) matters \nthat he pressured Mr. Jackson to do right away.

But then he told them about his idea of Quiet \nTime and put a sign on his desk that said \"Quiet Time, please \nreturn at 11:30.\" Whenever someone approached him during \nQuiet Time, he pointed to the sign, asked whether the caller \ncould wait until then, and made sure to get back to the inter­\nrupter promptly at 11:30. \nWhen he was particularly in need of concentration, he \nlooked around for an unused office or conference room. \nSometimes he went to the public library. (A top executive \nconfided to me that when he wanted Quiet Time he hid out \nin the back of a small coffee shop two blocks from his corpo­\nration's headquarters building.) \nHow To Handle the Sociables \nMr. Bean also found from his log that many people just \nstopped by to chat. He was on the main route to the water \ncooler and anyone running away from a difficult job back at \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OP YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 95 \nhis desk found him easy game for a few minutes of relaxing. \nHe therefore shifted his desk to a different angle. Then he \ntook away the extra visitor's chair, because he found that \nwhen two escapees got talking together at his desk it meant a \nminimum of twenty minutes' time wasted.

ASK LAKEIN'S QUESTION \nYOUR LIFETIME GOALS STATEMENT, your To Do List, and \nyour Schedule give you substantial control over the way you \nspend your time. Each of these is an extremely valuable plan­\nning tool. But they are not handy for the minute-to-minuto \ndecisions you have to make. \nWho can take fifteen minutes to plan a dozen times a day? \nNobody. You wouldn't get anything done. Which is why I'm \ngoing to hand you a new tool to use quickly and spontane­\nously as many times a day as you need it. It's called \"ask \nLakein's Question.\" Lake ins Question is: what is the best use \nof my time right now? \nAt first you'll have to remind yourself to keep asking \nLakein's Question whenever you're not positive whether \nyou're using your time to best advantage. After a week or so \nit should become second nature to you. \nIf your first answer when you ask Lakein's Question is *1 \ndon't know,\" then the best use of your time is to ask the \nquestion again. If you still get \"I don't know,\" then tell your­\nself: \"I already know that; but I still need a better answer.\" \nI don't mean to turn this into some silly game of hide-\nand-seek. I do suggest to you that if you really don't know \nthe best use of your time, then there's nothing more impor­\ntant than finding out. So do keep asking Lakein's Question \nuntil you get at least some sort of meaningful answer. \nAs soon as you get the first answer, stop.",

So do keep asking Lakein's Question \nuntil you get at least some sort of meaningful answer. \nAs soon as you get the first answer, stop. \nAlmost invariably, the first (and spontaneous) answer to \nLakein's Question is the best, and you should accept it. But a \nmistake is always a possibility. So take just a moment to \nmake your \"go/no-go\" decision. Your intuition may have \ntaken the morning off. If you feel you can't act on your first \nanswer, it's best to come up with an acceptable alternative at \nonce. \nLike all new habits, asking Lakein's Question takes a bit of \n96 \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 97 \npractice. As you adopt this routine, you'll find that your con­\nfidence increases, and that you come up consistently with \ngood answers the first time around. \nAsk Lakem's Question All the Time! \nA particularly good time to ask Lakem's Question is when \nyou have been interrupted by a visitor or telephone call (as­\nsuming that the interruption is desirable or necessary in the \nfirst place). When it's over, check whether you should go \nback to what you were doing or on to something new. \nAlso ask Lakein's Question when you notice that you are \nbecoming distracted. Are you listening to a conversation in \nthe next office? Wondering who just walked down the hall? \nDaydreaming about next year's vacation? Pop the question! \nAlso ask when you intuitively feel you may not be making \nthe best use of your time. Or you detect a tendency to pro­\ncrastinate. Or when you pause momentarily in the middle of \ndoing an A-l.

Once you get immersed in some \nactivities, they seem to acquire a momentum of their own. \nYou may then be carried along without control, drifting with \nthe tide. \nOne way to combat this drift is to set yourself control \npoints for reviewing your progress. Check every fifteen min­\nutes or half an hour—or go on until 3:30 and then review. \nOne way to remember to do this is to use a kitchen timer. If \nyou're not benefiting from continued effort, stop and change \nto do something else. \nYou can also set the timer to help you meet deadlines. If \nyou need to get something done in half an hour, set the timer \naccordingly. If you find the ticking annoying, put it in the \nbottom drawer; then you'll hear only the bell. Suppose the \ntimer rings and you're still not finished? To protect yourself, \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 99 \ndon't set the timer for thirty minutes; set it for twenty. Then \nyou can re-set priorities after twenty minutes. Are you sure \nyou're on the right track? You might want to set the timer \nfor another fifteen minutes as a reminder that the project is \nprobably not worth any more time. \nDo you suspect diminishing returns? Are you being need­\nlessly perfectionistic? Ask Lakein's Question. If you're not \nsure whether it is worth finishing something (or worth contin­\nuing), I suggest that you stop. If you don't come back to it, \nthen in fact you were done. If you feel uncomfortable the \nnext day about having stopped and you want to continue, go \nback to it But pretty soon . . . right!
