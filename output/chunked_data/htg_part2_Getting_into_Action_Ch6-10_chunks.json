The second tool for planning your \ntime continues where the Goals Statement leaves off. It helps \nyou decide on specific activities that you can do now to help \nyou achieve your long-term goals. \nYou cannot do a goal. Long-term planning and goal-setting \nmust therefore be complemented by short-term planning. \nThis kind of planning requires specifying activities. You can \ndo an activity. Activities are steps along the way to a goal. \nLet's say you desire security. Putting $10.00 in the bank or \ntalking to your stockbroker about your investment plans are \nactivities that will move you toward your goal. \nWhen you have planned well on both long-term and short-\nterm levels, then goals and activities fit together like well-\nmeshed gears. Most if not all of the activities specified in \nshort-term plans will contribute to the realization of the goals \nspecified in long-term plans. \nHow to List Activities Toward Your A-Goals \nIf you wish to accomplish such goals as happiness, success, \nor financial independence, an immense number and variety of \nactions are of course possible. Suppose you just want to enjoy \nyourself tonight. I bet you could list twenty-five or fifty ways \nto do it without even including anything fattening or illegal. \nThe same is true of any goal, no matter how crucial or \ntrivial. \nTo determine the right activities for achieving your A-\ngoals you must (1) list the possible activities for each A-goal, \nand (2) set priorities to allow you to select the most effective \nactivity to do now. \n37 \n38 ALAN LAKE IN \nIn listing activities, be as imaginative as possible. Quickly \nwrite down as many ideas as you can—it's a good way to get \ncreative juices flowing. Trying for quantity and speed will \nallow your intuition to operate. Your perceptions will come \ndirectly, unfiltered by your reasoning processes. Also, the \npressure of having to list activities will crease new insights. \nThe speed also allows you to run right past your inhibitions, \nbecause you simply don't give them a chance to operate. The \nimportant part of the Listing Activities exercise is to keep \nwriting. You're wasting your time if your pen or pencil point \nis not moving across the paper. \nDo not make any attempt to evaluate or censor your ideas \nyet. This list is for your personal benefit only. If you attempt \nto hide anything, you'll be fooling only yourself. It's impor­\ntant not to characterize activities as \"good\" or \"bad\" or \n\"frivolous\"—at least not while you're listing them. We'll \ncatch the less significant activities later when we prune the \nchoices. \nAlso, don't handcuff yourself by the thought that you \nmight not be able to do a particular activity. It may turn out, \nupon analysis, that you can do an activity even if at first \nblush it seems difficult or impossible. Just reserve judgment \nfor the present \nAnd don't let the fear bother you that once you list an ac­\ntivity you will have to do it. No one is going to force you to \ndo it. When you set priorities you may decide that the re­\nquired time and effort indicate that the activity is not worth \nthe time and effort required. But even impossible dreams may \nhave some future usefulness. \nIf you run out of activities to list, you might try repeating \na previous entry. Try variations on a theme, reactions to pre­\nvious entries, extensions, additions, implications, reactions, \ngreater or lesser detail, broader or narrower focus. The im­\nportant thing is to keep writing! \nSuppose your goal is to become an expert mountain climb­\ner. List all the mountains you might climb in order to \nachieve your goal, including the seemingly impossible \ndreams: the Matterhorn and Mount Everest. Perhaps your \ninterest lies in conquering only North American peaks? Euro­\npean? Asian? Breaking activities down by categories, sub­\ncategories, and sub-sub-categories can help. The important \nthing is to keep writing. \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 39 \nWhile Fve encouraged you to list as many activities as you \ncan without censoring or inhibiting the responses you put on \npaper, I do have one caution: Don't confuse goals with activ­\nities. Remember, an activity is something that can be done. \nYour goal might be to live a healthier life. The specific activ­\nities that might contribute to this end could be not eating \ndessert tonight, exercising three times this week, and giving \nup smoking for twenty-four hours. \nNow you're ready to make",

After our discussion she realized the \ntrouble: She spent her whole day on routine duties the boss \nhad asked her to do the day she was hired—answering the \n43 \n44 ALAN LAKE IN \ntelephone, taking dictation, doing the filing, showing people \ninto the office, answering questions, maintaining the station­\nery inventories. Her routine work load was so heavy that she \nwasn't able to absorb fun assignments.

But they don't have to wipe it out It all depends \non how well you recognize (and deal with) these inevitable \ntime-consumers and whether you are prepared to make time \nfor yourself. I know of no other way: To increase the likeli­\nhood of accomplishing important lifetime goals, you've got to \nplan your time each and every day. \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 45 \n\"Who's Got Time for Planning?\" \nNo matter how busy you are, you should always take the \ntime to plan. The less time you feel you have to spare, the \nmore important it is to plan your time carefully. Spend only \nten minutes at the beginning or end of the day planning, and \nit will repay your efforts many times over. \nSometimes you will be so busy that you'll feel you really \ndon't have time to plan. O.K., maybe you don't have time to \nplan and do absolutely everything else you'd like to get out of \nthe way. But think about this: By failing to plan, you will \nfree very little if any time, and by failing to plan you will al­\nmost certainly fail to discriminate among ABC's. Even if you \nare confining yourself to doing A's, you still might not do the \nbest A's. Therefore, although you think you never have time \nto plan when you are busy, you always come out ahead by \ninvesting time in planning anyway. Yes, I mean it: Exactly \nbecause we lack time to plan, we should take time to plan. \nPlanning is usually done best first thing in the morning or \nat the end of the day. There are many advantages to plan­\nning in the morning when you are fresh. You gain momen­\ntum as you go along. Having just thought about what you \nhave to do, you move easily to getting it done. With the day's \npriorities clearly in mind you are less likely to be sidetracked \nas you go along. \nThe advantage of planning in the evening is that you know \nwhere you have come from and this perspective",

So I suggest \nyou plan in the morning as well as in the evening. \nCan you afford the time? I have had several clients keep \ncareful track of how much time they spent on various activi­\nties during the week. They were conscientious people con­\ncerned about time and planning, more so than the average \n46 ALAN LAKE IN \nperson. They were convinced of the importance of planning \nand committed to spending as much time as necessary on it. \nThey found that all of their planning time came to less than \nfour hours a week. They concluded that it really doesn't take \nlong to plan—considerably less than an hour a day—but the \nresults are substantial: more A-l's get done, less trivia inter­\nferes. Planning kept them focused on the important things. \nSome executives I know have made it a rule not to leave \ntheir offices until they have the next day's plan on their desks. \nA further extension would be to come in fifteen minutes early \nthe next morning and sharpen up that plan. (Of course as in­\nterruptions and crises come up during the day, still further \nadjustments must be made.) \nI do almost all my planning early in the morning. As hard \nas I try, I can't seem to average more than three and a half \nhours a week at it. I wake up around 5 A.M., before anyone \nelse in the house, and I put this quiet time into my most im­\nportant activity—planning. \nEvery morning as part of my planning effort, I look at my \nLifetime Goals list and identify specific A-activities I can do \ntoday to move ahead toward those lifetime goals. The rest of \nthe time before breakfast I spend doing A-activities. Finish­\ning this book is one such activity and a lot of this work got \ndone before my family got up. \nI recommend using Friday afternoon for reviewing the \nweek, planning the following week's projects in a general way \nbut those you'll do on Monday in detail. Use Monday morn­\ning for refining your plan and starting your A-goals of the \nweek. \nHow to Block Out A-Time \nOne of the main planning tools I emphasize is scheduling. \nBut scheduling means more than just fitting into the hours \navailable all the things you must do: meetings, appointments, \ndeadlines. It means also making time for what you want to \ndo—your A's. \nIn laying out a weekly schedule the key is to block out \ntime for the A's that require a lot of time. Schedule large-\nenough blocks of time to build up momentum. Reserve par­\nticular days of the week (say, Tuesday and Thursday morn-\nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 4\" \nings) for major projects. Even if your day is fragmented by \ninterruptions, you can still attempt to keep blocks of time in­\ntact for the high-value A's. \nTo find more time for the A's, set aside a special A-time \neach day and firmly banish all C-items during this period. To \ncreate a block of time for A's to get done, start small and al­\nlocate, for example, fifteen minutes each day to use exclu­\nsively for A-items. You can gradually increase this time for \nthe A-items as you grow more comfortable with the idea of \nputting first things first. \nTry blocking A-time horizontally on a weekly calendar—at \nthe same time each day, say, Monday through Friday, 9:30-\n10:30 A.M. You can also block vertically down the page—say \nreserving Wednesday afternoon from 2-4 P.M. as A-time for \nthis week's A-project. \nOne husband, whose wife was in the habit of accepting \nmany dates for them to go out and who felt he didn't have \nenough time to be alone with her, went through her calendar \nand wrote \"busy'' alongside all the Tuesday nights. When she \nwas asked out for that date, she looked on the calendar and \nfound that she was \"busy.\" He thus freed A-time to spend \nalone",

Suppose you feel the \nneed to make a change in your eating habits. You already \nknow intuitively that you ought to reduce the quantity of \nfried foods and add a little more protein and a few fresh veg­\netables to help balance your diet. It would be a waste of time \nto keep track of every single item you eat before deciding \nwhat to change. On the other hand, keeping a daily record of \nthe fried foods and vegetables you eat during a month can \nsignificantly help you decrease the fried foods and increase \nthe vegetables. You immediately gain the benefits of better \nhealth, and you're freed from the drudgery of spending a \nmonth keeping track of everything you eat Likewise with \ntime. I feel it's much better to watch your time selectively, \nkeeping track of particular problem items which you feel are \nconsuming an inordinate amount of time. \n48 ALAN LAKE IN \nIn my experience, people who try to report everything find \nit so hopelessly complicated that they give up in despair \nwithin a couple of days without having made any changes. I \nbelieve that recordkeeping for sake of recordkeeping has very \nlittle value, but that selective recordkeeping for the sake of \ninfluencing the way you do a particular task has a great deal \nof value. \nMake a Time Change \nJust as you make a diet change, so you can make a time \nchange. If you feel there's too much work time in your life \nand not enough family and personal time, start quitting when \neverybody else does and-stop working overtime; start schedul­\ning more weekends with your family. \nToo much golf and not enough civic activities? You don't \nneed any complicated time-accounting to get you to cut back \non the golf. Too much housekeeping and not enough time for \ncreative pursuits? Let the dust accumulate for a day or two. \nYou don't want to recordkeep but you do want to schedule \nyour time, because you can find a great deal of time through \ncareful scheduling of whatever you really want to do. \nRemember: There is always enough time for the important \nthings. The busiest people are able to find time for what they \nwant to do, not because they have any more time than others \nbut because they think in terms of \"making\" time by careful \nscheduling. \nTrying to do the same thing at the same time each day \nboth conserves and generates energy. It conserves energy by \ncutting down on indecision. You perform menial tasks by \nrote. It generates energy through habit—the habit of expect­\ning to make phone calls, plan the meals, read the paper, at­\ntend a class, or go to a meeting—all at a particular time. \nYou Have Two Kinds of Prime Time \nAnother very important aspect of scheduling is \"prime\" \ntime. Internal prime time is the time when you work best— \nmorning, afternoon, or evening. External prime time is the \nbest time to attend to other people—those you have to deal \nwith in your job, your social life, and at home. \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 49 \nInternal prime time is the time when you concentrate best. \nI know early birds who never get a good idea after 7 A.M. \nand night owls who are most creative between 10 P.M. and \nmidnight. If you had to pick the two hours of the day when \nyou think most clearly, which would you pick? From 10 A.M. \nto 12 noon? From 4 P.M. to 6 P.M.? The two hours that you \nselect are probably your own internal prime time, but during \nthe next two weeks you might check to see whether your \nconcentration really is best during those hours. \nTry to save all your internal prime time for prime projects. \nMost business people pick the first couple of hours at \nwork as their internal prime time, yet this is usually the time \nthey read the newspaper, answer routine mail, get yesterday's \nunanswered telephone calls out of the way, and talk to col­\nleagues and subordinates. It's much better to save such \nroutine tasks",

HOW TO FIND TIME \nYOU NEVER KNEW YOU HAD \nMANY PEOPLE \"on the way up\" allow their family and \npersonal lives to be heavily impinged upon by work demands. \nOthers are so achievement-oriented that they feel guilty tak­\ning time out for anything that is not in some way related to \ntheir work. \nHorror stories abound of men who work so hard that they \nhardly ever see their families and who end up with ulcers and \nheart trouble. One study several years ago of successful and \nunsuccessful executives indicated that many men who ulti­\nmately fail had made their personal lives expendable to their \njobs. \nMy experience with clients has convinced me that when ex­\necutives find themselves on a treadmill they tend to lose per­\nspective of what's important. They spend time unnecessarily \non secondary matters and let many important ones go un­\ndone. This often tends to be cumulative. The more overtime \nthey put in, the more exhausted—and the less efficient—they \nbecome. The answer is not to spend more hours on the proj­\nect but to work more effectively within the time allotted. \nI recall one architect who came to me suffering from too \nmuch work and not enough play. He had only recently recov­\nered from a bleeding ulcer and again was working sixty hours \na week. His complaint was that he never had time to see his \nwife and young children. I suggested that he take off at noon \non Friday and, since summer was just beginning, take his \nfamily away to his favorite spot at Lake Tahoe. He rented a \ncabin, where he and his family spent each weekend during \nthe summer. Not surprisingly, he fell in love again with his \nwife, got to know his children, and his health improved. Since \nhe knew that he couldn't make up for low productivity by \nlong hours, he concentrated on getting the important things \ndone in the time he had. He actually got more done than he \never had working sixty hours, even though he shaved more \n52 \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 53 \nthan fifteen hours off that total. As a bonus, he got some of \nhis most creative ideas while he was relaxing at the lake, so \nhis leisure time paid off handsomely. All he really lost by cut­\nting back those fifteen hours was the detailed drafting that he \ncompulsively had felt the need to do himself. He delegated it \nto a draftsman. \nCan you work effectively if you are too fatigued from ex­\ncessive hours? Probably not. Maybe a better solution would \nbe to quit early, take the afternoon and evening off, and \ncome back the next day refreshed and physically able to \nwork twice as hard. \nGet More Done by Doing Nothing \nI think you will find that if you arrange things so that you \nfind time to relax and \"do nothing,\" you will get more done \nand have more fun doing it. \nOne client, an aerospace engineer, didn't know how to \"do \nnothing.\" Every minute of his leisure time was scheduled with \nintense activity. He had an outdoop-activities schedule in \nwhich he switched from skiing and ice hockey to water-skiing \nand tennis.

One kind of \ntime that is often overlooked is what I call \"transition time.\" \nThis kind of time starts when you awaken in the morning \nand ends when you begin your regular day's work. For most \npeople it amounts to about forty minutes a day, usually a bit \nlonger for women than men. One man I know has reduced it \nto fifteen minutes. He uses the time only to do essentials—eat \nbreakfast, shave, dress—and he does these as quickly as pos­\nsible. \nThere may be an advantage in extending rather than re­\nducing this transition time.

One creative manager, realizing \nthat he got some of his best ideas in the morning, has come \nto expect them and \"catches\" them for further development \nwhile they—and he—are still fresh. This can also be hobby \ntime for jogging, painting, sculpting, reading, writing, or \nwhatever. \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 57 \nHow to Use Commuting Time \nIf you feel it takes you too long to get to work, have you \nconsidered moving closer? In most cases this is not practical, \nyet more often than you might suspect a person does have \nthe very real option of moving closer to his place of employ­\nment. If you're a professional person, how about working out \nof your house twice a week and skipping that forty-five min­\nute commute on the freeway? \nIf you drive to work you're limited in the use you can \nmake of the time you spend sitting in traffic jams. Safety \ncomes first. But you can also listen to the radio. You can \npractice that new vocabulary exercise. More and more car­\ntridge tapes on educational subjects are becoming available, \nso you might learn a foreign language, listen to a business re­\nport, or take a memory course. Commuting time offers a \nchance to preview and plan your day, though you should \ncrystallize that plan on paper as soon as you sit down at your \ndesk. \nHow to Use Coffee Breaks \nCoffee breaks can be a good time to relax. But suppose \nyou're not particularly tense or tired. How about learning a \nword from your dictionary?

He began breeding mollies at the age \nof ten and has worked his way up to breeding killifish. Proba­\nbly because of his strong hobby interest—he spends three \nhours every evening on his fish-breeding project—he has \nfound a very routine civil-service job. While he is filling out \nforms for the state, he also plans what he's going to do next \nabout his fish. For example, he recently decided to breed a \nrare species of killifish which had to be imported from Af­\nrica. These fish were being imported under the Endangered \nSpecies Act, and he did much thinking about how to breed \nthem successfully in his second-floor apartment, quite differ­\nent from their natural habitat in the African stream. His \nroutine job gave him the money and the free time he needed \nfor his hobby. \nHawthorne is a famous example of what can be accom­\nplished while working in a humdrum job. He spent years at \nthe Customs House in Salem, Massachusetts, and produced \nfour novels, including the classic The Scarlet Letter. \nHow to Repeal Parkinson's Law \nI feel that so long as people do the job they are hired and \nrequired to do, they shouldn't have to look busy every minute \nof the time. I have always tried to give the people who work \nfor me a real incentive to make good use of their time by \nallowing them to do reading, writing, crocheting, or whatever \nthey want, after they finish my work. I have even sent them \nhome early when there was nothing else to be done. \nThe policy of making people sit at their desks even if they \nhave nothing to do breeds bad time habits and accounts for a \ncertain amount of psychological aggravation. It isn't surpris­\ning that work expands to fill the time allowed for its com­\npletion, as C. Northcote Parkinson has stated, since all too \noften there are no alternatives available. I propose that it's \ntime to repeal Parkinson's Law by allowing people to reap \nthe benefits of getting done early and letting them do their \npersonal things. \nIn \"limitless\" jobs where there are truly an endless number \nof things that could be done—such as creating advertising \ncopy, researching, selling encyclopedias, removing every \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 61 \nspeck of dust from the house—Parkinson's Law theoretically \ndoesn't apply; there is always enough work. In practice, cer­\ntain tasks tend to be done on a particular day and are then \nstretched out. You really can't push people to be creative by \nthe clock, and beyond a certain point simply putting in the \nhours is not necessarily the best way to get creative work \ndone, as the architect I mentioned earlier learned. \nParkinson's Law is real, and work does expand to fill the \ntime available, because you need to fill up time when you \ncan't go home early. Try to convince your boss to let you go \nhome if you've finished all your work by telling him what a \ngreat incentive it will give you to complete your work \nquickly. If you're unsuccessful, try to convince him to allow \nyou to satisfy your personal priorities of reading books, writ­\ning your own letters, and the like while you handle the \nswitchboard, the service counter, or the reception desk. \nMaking the Most Out of One \nSpare Minute \nYou can squeeze in a start toward your lifetime",

He told me he \nconsidered it a game. \nThe first thing in the morning, he would come in and lay \nout his list of what he wanted to accomplish that day.

He took \ntime to set priorities and went home feeling on top of his job \nbecause he had done the most important activities on his list \nIf little things mean a lot a list of things to do in priority \norder means a great deal because it provides you with the \nsecurity of knowing that nothing is missing; an affirmation \nof all your important activities; a motivation to cross off \nitems you don't need to do; and a reservoir from which you \ncan select activities to be done next \nBy doing more A's and fewer C's, the hierarchy of your \naccomplishments will change. You can break up your old A's \ninto new A's and B's, downgrading your old B's to C's and \ndropping most of the old C's off your list entirely. \nHow to Do More Things That Matter \nFor instance, a year ago attending Parents' Day at your \ndaughter's school would have been rated A. But now you're \ninvolved in a part-time fashion-design business, and your \ndaughter understands how busy you are and how much satis­\nfaction you derive from your business, so you won't go to \nParents' Day unless it's a slow time in your business. Last \nyear you attended to every detail of the annual inventory \nyourself. Happily, while you were doing it, you recorded the \nnecessary steps so that this year, with that reference guide in \nhand, last year's A (figuring out what to do) becomes this \nyear's C: following a routine. Now you are able to delegate \n68 ALAN LAKE IN \nthe annual inventory to the new stock boy and use your time \nto merchandise your products better. \nThe salesman who continually upgrades his customers finds \nthat last year's A—the $100-unit customer—is this year's C. \nNow his A-customer is a $500-unit account; his B is a $250-\nunit account. He upgraded his business this way by conscien­\ntiously going after the A-accounts. He spent more and more \nof his time with those who bought over $100, so gradually he \nwas able to consider anyone below $100 to be a C. To en­\ncourage this continual upgrading, he went through his cus­\ntomer files each week and threw away at least one low dollar \nprospect or customer. In my experience, most salesmen could \nbenefit substantially by arbitrarily weeding out 20 percent of \ntheir customers in terms of present and potential volume. \nLearning a musical instrument is much the same. When \nyou first play the piano your A is to practice easy pieces. \nOnce you become proficient, it would be a C to continue \nplaying them. So you practice more and more difficult pieces. \nWhen you are learning a difficult piece, the A is to play it \nslowly but accurately and the C to play it fast with what \nwould likely be many mistakes. As you become more profi­\ncient in playing a passage, the A becomes playing the passage \nat its correct tempo. \nIn learning and applying time use skills, it may be an A to \nwatch how to spend every five minutes for an hour so that \nyou become much more aware of time use.

His reminder to himself \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 79 \nabout the inadequacies of the stock boy could be dispensed \nwith, because the stock boy quit a few weeks later. \nHow to Keep on Top of Paperwork \nThe truth is that you need never shuffle a piece of paper \nagain. This does not mean that you can stop handling paper. \nBut you can develop a system that will keep the paper where \nit belongs and keep you on top of it—if you need to be. The \nsystem must take into account both incoming and outgoing \npaper, and what happens to it in between. \nIncoming mail should be screened and sorted. For a few \ndays, examine all mail critically. Look for opportunities to \neliminate or reduce the volume of paper that comes in. (You \nmight find a series of obsolete reports to be discontinued.) \nYou can then tell your secretary what material to screen out \nroutinely and throw away, what to route to others or file di­\nrectly. \nOne executive has his secretary sort his daily mail into \n\"Action,\" \"Information,\" and \"Deferred\" folders. The \"Ac­\ntion\" folder requires, and gets, his immediate attention. The \n\"Information\" folder he slips into his briefcase for reading on \nthe train. He keeps the \"Deferred\" file, which includes his \nperiodicals, in a drawer for spare moments or when he needs \na break from concentrating on more substantial matters. \nYou can encourage faster decisionmaking and get work \nout sooner by writing informal notes right on a piece of in­\ncoming mail and sending it on to the out-box. If you need to \nkeep a record of the correspondence for your file, or want a \nreminder to check for follow-through, have your secretary \nmake a photocopy. \nFor correspondence that requires a more formal or lengthy \nreply, a dictating machine can be your best friend. Those \nwho learn how to dictate a finished product on the first try \nrave about the time it saves. One executive saves even more \ntime by dictating only key ideas and then letting his secretary \nconstruct a letter that accomplishes his purpose. \nOnly Once, With Feeling! \nOne of my best rules is \"Handle each piece of paper only \nonce.\" Try not to put down an incoming piece of paper that \nso ALAN LAKEIN \nrequires a response until you have fired off that response. It is \noften easier to think of the right thing to say when you've \njust received the letter and your first reaction is fresh in your \nmind. In addition, you save the setup time required to famil­\niarize yourself with it again later on. \nNot all pieces of paper lend themselves to immediate and \nfinal action. Some papers linger for weeks or months and re­\nquire many actions",

More­\nover, you may find that your business reading becomes more \nenjoyable because you're now able to read more in less time. \nShould You Try Speed-Reading? \nClearly, the faster you read, the more time you save. How­\never, I find that few people who take courses in speed-read­\ning manage to maintain much increase in their reading speed. \nThey can speed-read for a few weeks after the course, but \nmost of them soon revert to their former pace. If you have \nto do a great deal of reading, it may be worth taking a \nspeed-reading course, because studies indicate that if you \nread at least two hours every day after taking the course, \nyou'll be able to maintain a higher reading speed. \nBut I think it's more important to read smarter rather than \nfaster. In other words, cut out the C-reading that is unsatisfy­\ning, useless, uninformative, or uninteresting and use that ex­\ntra time and energy on A-reading (most likely at your \nformer reading pace).
