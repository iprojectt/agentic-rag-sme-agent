Four times in the past decade, he had been invited to interview for head coaching positions with NFL teams.\nAll four times, the interviews hadn ’t gone well.Part of the problem was Dungy’s coaching philosophy. In his job \ninterviews, he would patiently explain his belief that the key to win-ning was changing players’ habits. He wanted to get players to stop making so many decisions during a game, he said.

Dungy recognized that you can never truly extinguish bad habits.\nRather, to change a habit, you must keep the old cue, and deliver \nthe old reward, but insert a new routine.\nThat’s the rule: If you use the same cue, and provide the same \nreward, you can shift the routine and change the habit. Almost any behavior can be transformed if the cue and reward stay the same.\nThe Golden Rule has inﬂ  uenced treatments for alcoholism, obe-\nsity,  obsessive- compulsive disorders, and hundreds of other destruc-tive behaviors, and understanding it can help anyone change their own habits. (Attempts to give up snacking, for instance, will often fail unless there’s a new routine to satisfy old cues and reward urges. A smoker usually can ’t quit unless she ﬁ  nds some activity to replace \ncigarettes when her nicotine craving is triggered.)\nFour times Dungy explained his  habit- based philosophy to team \nowners. Four times they listened politely, thanked him for his time, and then hired someone else.\nThen, in 1996, the woeful Buccaneers called.

So instead of teaching his players hundreds of formations, he has taught them only a hand-ful, but they have practiced over and over until the behaviors are automatic. When his strategy works, his players can move with a speed that is impossible to overcome.\nBut only when it works. If his players think too much or hesitate \nor  second- guess their instincts, the system falls apart. And so far, Dungy’s players have been a mess.\nThis time, however, as the Bucs line up on the  twenty- yard line, \nsomething is different. Take Regan Upshaw, a Buccaneer defensive end who has settled into a  three- point stance on the scrimmage line. Instead of looking up and down the line, trying to absorb as much information as possible, Upshaw is looking only at the cues that Dungy taught him to focus on. First, he glances at the outside foot of the opposite lineman (his toes are back, which means he is preparing to block while the quarterback passes); next, Upshaw looks at the lineman ’s shoulders (rotated slightly inward), and the space between him and the next player (a fraction narrower than expected).\nUpshaw has practiced how to react to each of these cues so many \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   64 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   64 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Golden Rule of Habit Change ● 65\ntimes that, at this point, he doesn ’t have to think about what to do. \nHe just follows his habits.\nSan Diego’s quarterback approaches the line of scrimmage and \nglances right, then left, barks the count and takes the ball. He drops back ﬁ  ve steps and stands tall, swiveling his head, looking for an \nopen receiver. Three seconds have passed since the play started. The stadium ’s eyes and the television cameras are on him.\nSo most observers fail to see what’s happening among the Buc-\ncaneers. As soon as Humphries took the snap, Upshaw sprang into action. Within the ﬁ  rst second of the play, he darted right, across the \nline of scrimmage, so fast the offensive lineman couldn ’t block him. Within the next second, Upshaw ran four more paces downﬁ  eld, his \nsteps a blur. In the next second, Upshaw moved three strides closer to the quarterback, his path impossible for the offensive lineman to predict.\nAs the play moves into its fourth second, Humphries, the San \nDiego quarterback, is suddenly exposed. He hesitates, sees Upshaw from the corner of his eye. And that’s when Humphries makes his mistake. He starts thinking .\nHumphries spots a teammate, a rookie tight end named Brian \nRoche, twenty yards downﬁ  eld. There’s another San Diego receiver \nmuch closer, waving his arms, calling for the ball. The short pass is the safe choice. Instead, Humphries, under pressure, performs a  split- second analysis, cocks his arm, and heaves to Roche.\nThat hurried decision is precisely what Dungy was hoping for. \nAs soon as the ball is in the air, a Buccaneer safety named John Lynch starts moving.

Lynch runs 10, then 15, then 20, then almost 25 yards before he is ﬁ  nally pushed \nout of bounds. The entire play has taken less than ten seconds.\nTwo minutes later, the Bucs score a touchdown, taking the lead \nfor the ﬁ  rst time all game. Five minutes later, they kick a ﬁ  eld goal. \nIn between, Dungy’s defense shuts down each of San Diego’s come-back attempts. The Buccaneers win, 25 to 17, one of the biggest upsets of the season.\nAt the end of the game, Lynch and Dungy exit the ﬁ  eld together.\n“It feels like something was different out there,” Lynch says as \nthey walk into the tunnel.\n“We’re starting to believe,” Dungy replies.\nII.\nTo understand how a coach ’s focus on changing habits could re-make a team, it’s necessary to look outside the world of sports. Way outside, to a dingy basement on the Lower East Side of New York City in 1934, where one of the largest and most successful attempts at  wide- scale habit change was born.\nSitting in the basement was a  thirty- nine- year- old alcoholic \nnamed Bill Wilson. Years earlier, Wilson had taken his ﬁ  rst drink \nduring ofﬁ  cers’ training camp in New Bedford, Massachusetts, \nwhere he was learning to ﬁ  re machine guns before getting shipped \nto France and World War I. Prominent families who lived near the base often invited ofﬁ  cers to dinner, and one Sunday night, Wilson \nattended a party where he was served rarebit and beer. He was  twenty- two years old and had never had alcohol before. The only \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   66 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   66 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Golden Rule of Habit Change ● 67\npolite thing, it seemed, was to drink the glass served to him. A few \nweeks later, Wilson was invited to another elegant affair. Men were in tuxedos, women were ﬂ  irting. A butler came by and put a Bronx \n cocktail— a combination of gin, dry and sweet vermouth, and or-ange  juice— into Wilson ’s hand. He took a sip and felt, he later said, as if he had found “the elixir of life.”\nBy the mid-1930s, back from Europe, his marriage falling apart \nand a fortune from selling stocks vaporized, Wilson was consuming three bottles of booze a day. On a cold November afternoon, while he was sitting in the gloom, an old drinking buddy called. Wilson invited him over and mixed a pitcher of pineapple juice and gin. He poured his friend a glass.\nHis friend handed it back. He’d been sober for two months, he \nsaid.\nWilson was astonished. He started describing his own struggles \nwith alcohol, including the ﬁ  ght he’d gotten into at a country club \nthat had cost him his job. He had tried to quit, he said, but couldn ’t manage it. He’d been to detox and had taken pills. He’d made prom-ises to his wife and joined abstinence groups. None of it worked. How, Wilson asked, had his friend done it?\n“I got religion,” the friend said. He talked about hell and tempta-\ntion, sin and the devil. “Realize you are licked, admit it, and get will-ing to turn your life over to God.”\nWilson thought the guy was nuts. “Last summer an alcoholic \ncrackpot; now, I suspected, a little cracked about religion,” he later wrote. When his friend left, Wilson polished off the booze and went to bed.\nA month later, in December 1934, Wilson checked into the \nCharles B. Towns Hospital for Drug and Alcohol Addictions, an up-scale Manhattan detox center. A physician started hourly infusions of a hallucinogenic drug called belladonna, then in vogue for the treatment of alcoholism. Wilson ﬂ  oated in and out of consciousness \non a bed in a small room.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   67 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   67 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n68 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nThen, in an episode that has",

For days, he hallucinated. The withdrawal pains made it feel as if insects were crawling across his skin. He was so nauseous he could hardly move, but the pain was too intense to stay still. “If there is a God, let Him show Himself!” Wilson yelled to his empty room. “I am ready to do anything. Anything!” At that mo-ment, he later wrote, a white light ﬁ  lled his room, the pain ceased, \nand he felt as if he were on a mountaintop, “and that a wind not of air but of spirit was blowing. And then it burst upon me that I was a free man. Slowly the ecstasy subsided. I lay on the bed, but now for a time I was in another world, a new world of consciousness.”\nBill Wilson would never have another drink. For the next  thirty- six \nyears, until he died of emphysema in 1971, he would devote himself to founding, building, and spreading Alcoholics Anonymous, until it became the largest, most  well- known and successful  habit- changing organization in the world.\nAn estimated 2.1 million people seek help from AA each year, \nand as many as 10 million alcoholics may have achieved sobriety through the group. AA doesn ’t work for  everyone— success rates are difﬁ cult to measure, because of participants’  anonymity— but mil-\nlions credit the program with saving their lives. AA’s foundational credo, the famous twelve steps, have become cultural lodestones in-corporated into treatment programs for overeating, gambling, debt, sex, drugs, hoarding,  self- mutilation, smoking, video game addic-tions, emotional dependency, and dozens of other destructive be-haviors. The group’s techniques offer, in many respects, one of the most powerful formulas for change.\nAll of which is somewhat unexpected, because AA has almost no \ngrounding in science or most accepted therapeutic methods.\nAlcoholism, of course, is more than a habit. It’s a physical addic-\ntion with psychological and perhaps genetic roots. What’s interest-ing about AA, however, is that the program doesn ’t directly attack \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   68 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   68 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Golden Rule of Habit Change ● 69\nmany of the psychiatric or biochemical issues that researchers say \nare often at the core of why alcoholics drink. In fact, AA’s methods seem to sidestep scientiﬁ  c and medical ﬁ  ndings altogether, as well \nas the types of intervention many psychiatrists say alcoholics really need.\n*\nWhat AA provides instead is a method for attacking the habits \nthat surround alcohol use. AA, in essence, is a giant machine for changing habit loops. And though the habits associated with alco-holism are extreme, the lessons AA provides demonstrate how al-most any  habit— even the most  obstinate— can be changed.\n● ● ●\nBill Wilson didn ’t read academic journals or consult many doctors \nbefore founding AA. A few years after he achieved sobriety, he wrote the  now- famous twelve steps in a rush one night while sitting in bed. He chose the number twelve because there were twelve apos-\n* The line separating habits and addictions is often difﬁ  cult to measure. For instance, the \nAmerican Society of Addiction Medicine deﬁ  nes addiction as “a primary, chronic disease of brain \nreward, motivation, memory and related circuitry. . . . Addiction is characterized by impairment in behavioral control, craving, inability to consistently abstain, and diminished relationships.”\nBy that deﬁ  nition, some researchers note, it is difﬁ  cult to determine why spending ﬁ  fty dollars \na week on cocaine is bad, but ﬁ  fty dollars a week on coffee is okay. Someone who craves a latte \nevery afternoon may seem clinically addicted to an observer who thinks ﬁ  ve dollars for coffee \ndemonstrates an “impairment in behavioral control.” Is someone who would prefer running to having breakfast with his kids addicted to exercise?\nIn general, say many researchers, while addiction is complicated and still poorly understood, \nmany of the behaviors that we",

For days, he hallucinated. The withdrawal pains made it feel as if insects were crawling across his skin. He was so nauseous he could hardly move, but the pain was too intense to stay still. “If there is a God, let Him show Himself!” Wilson yelled to his empty room. “I am ready to do anything. Anything!” At that mo-ment, he later wrote, a white light ﬁ  lled his room, the pain ceased, \nand he felt as if he were on a mountaintop, “and that a wind not of air but of spirit was blowing. And then it burst upon me that I was a free man. Slowly the ecstasy subsided. I lay on the bed, but now for a time I was in another world, a new world of consciousness.”\nBill Wilson would never have another drink. For the",

Some substances, such as drugs, cigarettes, or alcohol, can create physical dependencies. But these physical cravings often fade quickly after use is discontinued. A physical addiction to nicotine, for instance, lasts only as long as the chemical is in a smoker’s bloodstream—about one hundred hours after the last cigarette. Many of the lingering urges that we think of as nicotine’s addictive twinges are re-ally behavioral habits asserting themselves—we crave a cigarette at breakfast a month later not because we physically need it, but because we remember so fondly the rush it once provided each morning. Attacking the behaviors we think of as addictions by modifying the habits surrounding them has been shown, in clinical studies, to be one of the most effective modes of treatment. (Though it is worth noting that some chemicals, such as opiates, can cause prolonged physical addictions, and some studies indicate that a small group of people seem predisposed to seek out addictive chemicals, regardless of behavioral interventions. The number of chemicals that cause long-term physical addictions, however, is relatively small, and the number of predisposed addicts is estimated to be much less than the number of alcoholics and addicts seeking help.)\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   69 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   69 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n70 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\ntles. And some aspects of the program are not just unscientiﬁ  c, they \ncan seem downright strange.\nTake, for instance, AA’s insistence that alcoholics attend “ninety \nmeetings in ninety days”—a stretch of time, it appears, chosen at random. Or the program ’s intense focus on spirituality, as articu-lated in step three, which says that alcoholics can achieve sobriety by making “a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understand him.” Seven of the twelve steps mention God or spirituality, which seems odd for a program founded by a  onetime agnostic who, throughout his life, was openly hostile toward orga-nized religion. AA meetings don ’t have a prescribed schedule or cur-riculum. Rather, they usually begin with a member telling his or her story, after which other people can chime in. There are no profes-sionals who guide conversations and few rules about how meetings are supposed to function. In the past ﬁ  ve decades, as almost every \naspect of psychiatry and addiction research has been revolutionized by discoveries in behavioral sciences, pharmacology, and our under-standing of the brain, AA has remained frozen in time.\nBecause of the program ’s lack of rigor, academics and research-\ners have often criticized it. AA’s emphasis on spirituality, some claimed, made it more like a cult than a treatment. In the past ﬁ  f-\nteen years, however, a reevaluation has begun. Researchers now say the program ’s methods offer valuable lessons. Faculty at Harvard, Yale, the University of Chicago, the University of New Mexico, and dozens of other research centers have found a kind of science within AA that is similar to the one Tony Dungy used on the football ﬁ  eld. \nTheir ﬁ  ndings endorse the Golden Rule of habit change: AA suc-\nceeds because it helps alcoholics use the same cues, and get the same reward, but it shifts the routine.\nResearchers say that AA works because the program forces peo-\nple to identify the cues and rewards that encourage their alcoholic habits, and then helps them ﬁ  nd new behaviors. When Claude Hop-\nkins was selling Pepsodent, he found a way to create a new habit by \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   70 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   70 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Golden Rule of Habit Change ● 71\ntriggering a new craving. But to change an old habit, you must ad-\ndress an old craving. You have to keep the same cues and rewards as before, and feed the craving by inserting a new routine.\nTake steps four (to make “a searching and fearless inventory of \nourselves”) and ﬁ  ve (to admit “to God, to ourselves, and to another \nhuman being the exact nature of our wrongs”).\n“It’s not obvious from the",

Some substances, such as drugs, cigarettes, or alcohol, can create physical dependencies. But these physical cravings often fade quickly after use is discontinued. A physical addiction to nicotine, for instance, lasts only as long as the chemical is in a smoker’s bloodstream—about one hundred hours after the last cigarette. Many of the lingering urges that we think of as nicotine’s addictive twinges are re-ally behavioral habits asserting themselves—we crave a cigarette at breakfast a month later not because we physically need it, but because we remember so fondly the rush it once provided each morning. Attacking the behaviors we think of as addictions by modifying the habits surrounding them has been shown, in clinical studies, to be one of the most effective modes of treatment. (Though it is worth noting that some chemicals, such as opiates, can cause prolonged physical addictions, and some studies indicate that a small group of people seem predisposed to seek out addictive chemicals, regardless of behavioral interventions.

Alcoholics crave a drink because it offers escape, relaxation, companionship, the blunting of anxieties, and an opportunity for emotional release. They might crave a cocktail to forget their worries. But they don ’t necessarily crave feeling drunk. The physical effects of alcohol are often one of the least rewarding parts of drinking for addicts.\n“There is a hedonistic element to alcohol,” said Ulf Mueller, a Ger-\nman neurologist who has studied brain activity among alcoholics. “But people also use alcohol because they want to forget something or to satisfy other cravings, and these relief cravings occur in totally dif-ferent parts of the brain than the craving for physical pleasure.”\nIn order to offer alcoholics the same rewards they get at a bar, AA \nhas built a system of meetings and  companionship— the “sponsor” each member works  with— that strives to offer as much escape, dis-traction, and catharsis as a Friday night bender. If someone needs relief, they can get it from talking to their sponsor or attending a group gathering, rather than toasting a drinking buddy.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   71 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   71 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n72 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\n“ AA forces you to create new routines for what to do each night \ninstead of drinking,” said Tonigan. “You can relax and talk through your anxieties at the meetings. The triggers and payoffs stay the same, it’s just the behavior that changes.”\nOne particularly dramatic demonstration of how alcoholics’ cues \nand rewards can be transferred to new routines occurred in 2007, when Mueller, the German neurologist, and his colleagues at the University of Magdeburg implanted small electrical devices inside the brains of ﬁ  ve alcoholics who had repeatedly tried to give up \nbooze. The alcoholics in the study had each spent at least six months in rehab without success. One of them had been through detox more than sixty times.\nThe devices implanted in the men ’s heads were positioned inside \ntheir basal  ganglia— the same part of the brain where the MIT re-searchers found the habit  loop— and they emitted an electrical charge that interrupted the neurological reward that triggers habitual crav-ings. After the men recovered from the operations, they were ex-posed to cues that had once triggered alcoholic urges, such as photos of beer or trips to a bar.

Four of them relapsed soon after the surgery, usually after a stressful event. They picked up a bottle because that’s how they automatically dealt with anxiety.

    "text": ". Alcoholics crave a drink because it offers escape, relaxation, companionship, the blunting of anxieties, and an opportunity for emotional release. They might crave a cocktail to forget their worries. But they don ’t necessarily crave feeling drunk. The physical effects of alcohol are often one of the least rewarding parts of drinking for addicts.\n“There is a hedonistic element to alcohol,” said Ulf Mueller, a Ger-\nman neurologist who has studied brain activity among alcoholics. “But people also use alcohol because they want to forget something or to satisfy other cravings, and these relief cravings occur in totally dif-ferent parts of the brain than the craving for physical pleasure.”\nIn order to offer alcoholics the same rewards they get at a bar, AA \nhas built a system of meetings and  companionship— the “sponsor” each member works  with— that strives to offer as much escape, dis-traction, and catharsis as a Friday night bender. If someone needs relief, they can get it from talking to their sponsor or attending a group gathering, rather than toasting a drinking buddy.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   71 Duhi_9781400069286",

For most of her life, Mandy had bitten her nails, gnawing them until they bled. Lots of people bite their nails. For chronic nail biters, however, it’s a problem of a different scale. Mandy would often bite until her nails pulled away from the skin underneath. Her ﬁ  ngertips were covered with tiny scabs. The end of \nher ﬁ  ngers had become blunted without nails to protect them and \nsometimes they tingled or itched, a sign of nerve injury. The biting habit had damaged her social life. She was so embarrassed around her friends that she kept her hands in her pockets and, on dates, would become preoccupied with balling her ﬁ  ngers into ﬁ  sts. She \nhad tried to stop by painting her nails with  foul- tasting polishes or promising herself, starting right now, that she would muster the \nwillpower to quit. But as soon as she began doing homework or watching television, her ﬁ  ngers ended up in her mouth.\nThe counseling center referred Mandy to a doctoral psychology \nstudent who was studying a treatment known as “habit reversal training.” The psychologist was well acquainted with the Golden Rule of habit change. He knew that changing Mandy’s nail biting habit required inserting a new routine into her life.\n“What do you feel right before you bring your hand up to your \nmouth to bite your nails?” he asked her.\n“There’s a little bit of tension in my ﬁ  ngers,” Mandy said. “It hurts \na little bit here, at the edge of the nail. Sometimes I’ll run my thumb along, looking for hangnails, and when I feel something catch, I’ll bring it up to my mouth then. I’ll go ﬁ  nger by ﬁ  nger, biting all the \nrough edges. Once I start, it feels like I have to do all of them.”\nAsking patients to describe what triggers their habitual behavior \nis called awareness training, and like AA’s insistence on forcing al-coholics to recognize their cues, it’s the ﬁ  rst step in habit reversal \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   74 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   74 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nThe Golden Rule of Habit Change ● 75\ntraining.

As they talked, \nthough, it became clearer that she bit when she was bored. The ther-apist put her in some typical situations, such as watching television and doing homework, and she started nibbling. When she had worked through all of the nails, she felt a brief sense of complete-ness, she said. That was the habit’s reward: a physical stimulation she had come to crave.\nAt the end of their ﬁ  rst session, the therapist sent Mandy home \nwith an assignment: Carry around an index card, and each time you feel the  cue— a tension in your  ﬁ  ngertips— make a check mark on \nthe card. She came back a week later with  twenty- eight checks. She was, by that point, acutely aware of the sensations that preceded her habit. She knew how many times it occurred during class or while watching television.\nThen the therapist taught Mandy what is known as a “competing Routine\nReward\nMANDY’S HABIT LOOPCueCRAVING \nFOR \nSTIMULATION\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   75 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   75 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n76 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nresponse.” Whenever she felt that tension in her ﬁ  ngertips, he told \nher, she should immediately put her hands in her pockets or under her legs, or grip a pencil or something else that made it impossible to put her ﬁ  ngers in her mouth. Then Mandy was to search for \nsomething that would provide a quick physical  stimulation— such as rubbing her arm or rapping her knuckles on a  desk— anything that would produce a physical response.\nThe cues and rewards stayed the same. Only the routine \nchanged.\nThey practiced in the therapist’s ofﬁ  ce for about thirty minutes \nand Mandy was sent home with a new assignment: Continue with the index card, but make a check when you feel the tension in your ﬁ ngertips and a hash mark when you successfully override the \nhabit.\nA week later, Mandy had bitten her nails only three times and \nhad used the competing response seven times. She rewarded her-self with a manicure, but kept using the note cards. After a month, the  nail- biting habit was gone. The competing routines had become automatic. One habit had replaced another.\n“It seems ridiculously simple, but once you’re aware of how your \nhabit works, once you recognize the cues and rewards, you’re half-way to changing it,” Nathan Azrin, one of the developers of habit reversal training, told me. “It seems like it should be more complex.

You just have to be \ndeliberate about it.”*\nToday, habit reversal therapy is used to treat verbal and physical \ntics, depression, smoking, gambling problems, anxiety, bedwetting, procrastination,  obsessive- compulsive disorders, and other behav-ioral problems. And its techniques lay bare one of the fundamental principles of habits: Often, we don ’t really understand the cravings driving our behaviors until we look for them. Mandy never realized that a craving for physical stimulation was causing her nail biting, but once she dissected the habit, it became easy to ﬁ  nd a new rou-\ntine that provided the same reward.\nSay you want to stop snacking at work. Is the reward you’re seek-\ning to satisfy your hunger? Or is it to interrupt boredom? If you snack for a brief release, you can easily ﬁ  nd another  routine— such as taking \n* It is important to note that though the process",

More than three dozen stud-ies of former smokers have found that identifying the cues and rewards they associate with cigarettes, and then choosing new rou-tines that provide similar  payoffs— a piece of Nicorette, a quick se-ries of  push- ups, or simply taking a few minutes to stretch and  relax— makes it more likely they will quit.\nIf you identify the cues and rewards, you can change the routine.\nAt least, most of the time.

They didn ’t have the talent they needed.\n“Those are the supposed reasons,” Dungy said. “Now here is a \nfact: Nobody is going to outwork us.”\nDungy’s strategy, he explained, was to shift the team ’s behaviors \nuntil their performances were automatic. He didn ’t believe the Buc-caneers needed the thickest playbook. He didn ’t think they had to memorize hundreds of formations. They just had to learn a few key moves and get them right every time.\nHowever, perfection is hard to achieve in football. “Every play in \n football— every  play— someone messes up,” said Herm Edwards, one of Dungy’s assistant coaches in Tampa Bay. “Most of the time, it’s not physical.

Once you’re in position, then start looking for the QB.”\nThis was a relatively modest  shift— Brooks’s eyes went to the \nsame cues, but rather than looking multiple places at once, Dungy put them in a sequence and told him, ahead of time, the choice to make when he saw each key. The brilliance of this system was that it removed the need for decision making. It allowed Brooks to move faster, because everything was a  reaction— and eventually a  habit— rather than a choice.\nDungy gave every player similar instructions, and practiced the \nformations over and over. It took almost a year for Dungy’s habits to take hold. The team lost early, easy games. Sports columnists asked why the Bucs were wasting so much time on psychological quackery.\nBut slowly, they began to improve. Eventually, the patterns be-\ncame so familiar to players that they unfolded automatically when the team took the ﬁ  eld. In Dungy’s second season as coach, the Bucs \nwon their ﬁ  rst �",

In Dungy’s second season as coach, the Bucs \nwon their ﬁ  rst ﬁ  ve games and went to the  play- offs for the ﬁ  rst time \nin ﬁ fteen years. In 1999, they won the division championship.\nDungy’s coaching style started drawing national attention. The \nsports media fell in love with his  soft- spoken demeanor, religious piety, and the importance he placed on balancing work and family. Newspaper stories described how he brought his sons, Eric and Jamie, to the stadium so they could hang out during practice. They did their homework in his ofﬁ  ce and picked up towels in the locker \nroom.

So I went to a bar and had two vodkas, and went back to my desk, and at lunch I went to Chili’s with a friend, and we each had a few beers, and then at about two o’clock, me and another friend left and found a place with  a two- for- one happy hour. It was my day to pick up the  kids— my wife didn ’t know about the affair  yet— so I drove to their school and got them, and",

Researchers began ﬁ  nding that habit replace-\nment worked pretty well for many people until the stresses of  life— such as ﬁ  nding out your mom has cancer, or your marriage is \ncoming  apart— got too high, at which point alcoholics often fell off the wagon. Academics asked why, if habit replacement is so effec-tive, it seemed to fail at such critical moments. And as they dug into alcoholics’ stories to answer that question, they learned that replace-ment habits only become durable new behaviors when they are accompanied by something else.\nOne group of researchers at the Alcohol Research Group in Cali-\nfornia, for instance, noticed a pattern in interviews. Over and over again, alcoholics said the same thing: Identifying cues and choosing new routines is important, but without another ingredient, the new habits never fully took hold.\nThe secret, the alcoholics said, was God.Researchers hated that explanation. God and spirituality are not \ntestable hypotheses. Churches are ﬁ  lled with drunks who",

A conviction emerged among players about the strength of Dungy’s strategy. In practices and scrimmages leading up to the start of the 2006 season, the Colts played tight, precise football.\n“Most football teams aren ’t really teams.

But just as often, a similar belief can emerge without any kind of adversity.\nIn a 1994 Harvard study that examined people who had radically \nchanged their lives, for instance, researchers found that some peo-ple had remade their habits after a personal tragedy, such as a di-vorce or a  life- threatening illness. Others changed after they saw a friend go through something awful, the same way that Dungy’s players watched him struggle.\nJust as frequently, however, there was no tragedy that preceded \npeople’s transformations. Rather, they changed because they were embedded in social groups that made change easier. One woman said her entire life shifted when she signed up for a psychology class and met a wonderful group. “It opened a Pandora’s box,” the woman told researchers. “I could not tolerate the status quo any longer. I had changed in my core.” Another man said that he found new friends among whom he could practice being gregarious. “When I do make the effort to overcome my shyness, I feel that it is not really me acting, that it’s someone else,” he said.

One woman told researchers her life transformed after a day spent cleaning  toilets— and after weeks of discussing with the rest of the cleaning crew whether she should leave her husband.\n“Change occurs among other people,” one of the psychologists \ninvolved in the study, Todd Heatherton, told me. “It seems real when we can see it in other people’s eyes.”\nThe precise mechanisms of belief are still little understood. No \none is certain why a group encountered in a psychology class can convince a woman that everything is different, or why Dungy’s team came together after their coach ’s son passed away. Plenty of people talk to friends about unhappy marriages and never leave their spouses; lots of teams watch their coaches experience adversity and never gel.\nBut we do know that for habits to permanently change, people \nmust believe that change is feasible. The same process that makes AA so  effective— the power of a group to teach individuals how to  believe— happens whenever people come together to help one an-other change.

If Dungy’s team could stop the Patriots from scoring a touchdown, the Colts would win.\nSixty seconds is an eternity in football.The Patriots’ quarterback, Tom Brady, had scored touchdowns in \nfar less time. Sure enough, within seconds of the start of play, Brady moved his team halfway down the ﬁ  eld.

Marlin Jackson, a Colts cornerback, stood ten yards back from the line. He looked at his cues: the width of the gaps between the Patriot linemen and the depth of the run-ning back’s stance. Both told him this was going to be a passing play. Tom Brady, the Patriots’ quarterback, took the snap and dropped back to pass. Jackson was already moving. Brady cocked his arm and heaved the ball. His intended target was a Patriot receiver  twenty- two yards away, wide open, near the middle of the ﬁ  eld. If the receiver \ncaught the ball, it was likely he could make it close to the end zone or score a touchdown. The football ﬂ  ew through the air. Jackson, the \nColts cornerback, was already running at an angle, following his habits. He rushed past the receiver’s right shoulder, cutting in front of him just as the ball arrived. Jackson plucked the ball out of the air for an interception, ran a few more steps and then slid to the ground, hugging the ball to his chest. The whole play had taken less than ﬁ  ve \nseconds.
