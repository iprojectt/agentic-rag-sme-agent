Advances such as \nrobotics and voice recognition are \nautomating many low-skilled positions, \nbut as these economists emphasize, \n“other technologies like data \nvisualization, analytics, high speed \ncommunications, and rapid prototyping \nhave augmented the contributions of\n\nmore abstract and data-driven reasoning, \nincreasing the values of these jobs.” In \nother words, those with the oracular \nability to work with and tease valuable \nresults out of increasingly complex \nmachines will thrive. Tyler Cowen \nsummarizes this reality more bluntly: \n“The key question will be: are you good \nat working with intelligent machines or \nnot?”\nNate Silver, of course, with his \ncomfort in feeding data into large \ndatabases, then siphoning it out into his \nmysterious Monte Carlo simulations, is \nthe epitome of the high-skilled worker. \nIntelligent machines are not an obstacle \nto Silver’s success, but instead provide\n\nits precondition.\nThe Superstars\nThe ace programmer David Heinemeier \nHansson provides an example of the \nsecond group that Brynjolfsson and \nMcAfee predict will thrive in our new \neconomy: “superstars.” High-speed data \nnetworks and collaboration tools like e­\nmail and virtual meeting software have \ndestroyed regionalism in many sectors of \nknowledge work. It no longer makes \nsense, for example, to hire a full-time \nprogrammer, put aside office space, and \npay benefits, when you can instead pay \none of the world’s best programmers,\n\nlike Hansson, for just enough time to \ncomplete the project at hand. In this \nscenario, you’ll probably get a better \nresult for less money, while Hansson can \nservice many more clients per year, and \nwill therefore also end up better off.\nThe fact that Hansson might be \nworking remotely from Marbella, Spain, \nwhile your office is in Des Moines, \nIowa, doesn’t matter to your company, as \nadvances in communication and \ncollaboration technology make the \nprocess near seamless. (This reality \ndoes matter, however, to the less-skilled \nlocal programmers living in Des Moines \nand in need of a steady paycheck.) This \nsame trend holds for the growing number\n\nof fields where technology makes \nproductive remote work possible— \nconsulting, marketing, writing, design, \nand so on. Once the talent market is \nmade universally accessible, those at the \npeak of the market thrive while the rest \nsuffer.\nIn a seminal 1981 paper, the \neconomist Sherwin Rosen worked out \nthe mathematics behind these “winner- \ntake-all” markets. One of his key insights \nwas to explicitly model talent—labeled, \ninnocuously, with the variable q in his \nformulas— as a factor with “imperfect \nsubstitution,” which Rosen explains as \nfollows: “Hearing a succession of\nmediocre singers does not add up to a\n\nsingle outstanding performance.” In \nother words, talent is not a commodity \nyou can buy in bulk and combine to \nreach the needed levels: There’s a \npremium to being the best. Therefore, if \nyou’re in a marketplace where the \nconsumer has access to all performers, \nand everyone’s q value is clear, the \nconsumer will choose the very best. \nEven if the talent advantage of the best is \nsmall compared to the next rung down on \nthe skill ladder, the superstars still win \nthe bulk of the market.\nIn the 1980s, when Rosen studied \nthis effect, he focused on examples like \nmovie stars and musicians, where there \nexisted clear markets, such as music\n\nstores and movie theaters, where an \naudience has access to different \nperformers and can accurately \napproximate their talent before making a \npurchasing decision. The rapid rise of \ncommunication and collaboration \ntechnologies has transformed many other \nformerly local markets into a similarly \nuniversal bazaar",

The rapid rise of \ncommunication and collaboration \ntechnologies has transformed many other \nformerly local markets into a similarly \nuniversal bazaar. The small company \nlooking for a computer programmer or \npublic relations consultant now has \naccess to an international marketplace of \ntalent in the same way that the advent of \nthe record store allowed the small-town \nmusic fan to bypass local musicians to \nbuy albums from the world’s best bands. \nThe superstar effect, in other words, has\n\na broader application today than Rosen \ncould have predicted thirty years ago. \nAn increasing number of individuals in \nour economy are now competing with \nthe rock stars of their sectors.\nThe Owners\nThe final group that will thrive in our \nnew economy—the group epitomized by \nJohn Doerr—consists of those with \ncapital to invest in the new technologies \nthat are driving the Great Restructuring. \nAs we’ve understood since Marx, \naccess to capital provides massive \nadvantages. It’s also true, however, that \nsome periods offer more advantages than\n\nothers.

To \nunderstand why, first recall that \nbargaining theory, a key component in \nstandard economic thinking, argues that \nwhen money is made through the \ncombination of capital investment and \nlabor, the rewards are returned, roughly\n\nspeaking, proportional to the input. As \ndigital technology reduces the need for \nlabor in many industries, the proportion \nof the rewards returned to those who \nown the intelligent machines is growing. \nA venture capitalist in today’s economy \ncan fund a company like Instagram, \nwhich was eventually sold for a billion \ndollars, while employing only thirteen  \npeople.  When else in history could such \na small amount of labor be involved in \nsuch a large amount of value? With so \nlittle input from labor, the proportion of \nthis wealth that flows back to the \nmachine owners—in this case, the \nventure investors—is without precedent. \nIt’s no wonder that a venture capitalist I\n\ninterviewed for my last book admitted to \nme with some concern, “Everyone wants \nmy job.”\nLet’s pull together the threads spun so \nfar: Current economic thinking, as I’ve \nsurveyed, argues that the unprecedented \ngrowth and impact of technology are \ncreating a massive restructuring of our \neconomy. In this new economy, three \ngroups will have a particular advantage: \nthose who can work well and creatively \nwith intelligent machines, those who are \nthe best at what they do, and those with \naccess to capital.\nTo be clear, this Great Restructuring \nidentified by economists like\n\nBrynjolfsson, McAfee, and Cowen is not \nthe only economic trend of importance at \nthe moment, and the three groups \nmentioned previously are not the only \ngroups who will do well, but what’s \nimportant for this book’s argument is that \nthese trends, even if not alone, are \nimportant, and these groups, even if they \nare not the only such groups, will thrive. \nIf you can join any of these groups, \ntherefore, you’ll do well. If you cannot, \nyou might still do well, but your position \nis more precarious.\nThe question we must now face is the \nobvious one: How does one join these \nwinners? At the risk of quelling your \nrising enthusiasm, I should first confess\n\nthat I have no secret for quickly \namassing capital and becoming the next \nJohn Doerr. (If I had such secrets, it’s \nunlikely I’d share them in a book.) The \nother two winning groups, however, are \naccessible. How to access them is the \ngoal we tackle next.\nHow to Become a Winner in \nthe New Economy\nI just identified two groups that are \npoised to thrive and that I claim are \naccessible: those who can work\ncreatively with intelligent machines and \nthose who are stars in their field.

The ability to produce at an elite \nlevel, in terms of both quality \nand speed.\nLet’s begin with the first ability. To\n\nstart, we must remember that we’ve been \nspoiled by the intuitive and drop-dead- \nsimple user experience of many \nconsumer-facing technologies, like \nTwitter and the iPhone. These examples, \nhowever, are consumer products, not \nserious tools: Most of the intelligent \nmachines driving the Great Restructuring \nare significantly more complex to \nunderstand and master.\nConsider Nate Silver, our earlier \nexample of someone who thrives by \nworking well with complicated \ntechnology. If we dive deeper into his \nmethodology, we discover that \ngenerating data-driven election forecasts \nis not as easy as typing “Who will win\n\nmore votes?” into a search box. He \ninstead maintains a large database of \npoll results (thousands of polls from \nmore than 250 pollsters) that he feeds \ninto Stata, a popular statistical analysis \nsystem produced by a company called \nStataCorp. These are not easy tools to \nmaster. Here, for example, is the type of \ncommand you need to understand to \nwork with a modern database like Silver \nuses:\nCREATE VIEW cities AS SELECT \nname, population, altitude FROM \ncapitals UNION SELECT name, \npopulation, altitude FROM \nnon_capitals;\n\nDatabases of this type are \ninterrogated in a language called SQL. \nYou send them commands like the one \nshown here to interact with their stored \ninformation.

It wasn’t enough for Nate\n\nSilver to learn how to manipulate large \ndata sets and run statistical analyses; he \nneeded to then show that he could use \nthis skill to tease information from these \nmachines that a large audience cared \nabout. Silver worked with many stats \ngeeks during his days at Baseball  \nProspectus , but it was Silver alone who \nput in the effort to adapt these skills to \nthe new and more lucrative territory of \nelection forecasting. This provides \nanother general observation for joining \nthe ranks of winners in our economy: If \nyou don’t produce, you won’t thrive—no \nmatter how skilled or talented you are.\nHaving established two abilities that \nare fundamental to getting ahead in our\n\nnew, technology-disrupted world, we \ncan now ask the obvious follow-up \nquestion: How does one cultivate these \ncore abilities? It’s here that we arrive at \na central thesis of this book: The two  \ncore abilities just described depend on  \nyour ability to perform deep work. If \nyou haven’t mastered this foundational \nskill, you’ll struggle to learn hard things \nor produce at an elite level.\nThe dependence of these abilities on \ndeep work isn’t immediately obvious; it \nrequires a closer look at the science of \nlearning, concentration, and productivity. \nThe sections ahead provide this closer \nlook, and by doing so will help this \nconnection between deep work and\n\neconomic success shift for you from \nunexpected to unimpeachable.\nDeep Work Helps You \nQuickly Learn Hard Things\n“Let your mind become a lens, thanks to \nthe converging rays of attention; let your \nsoul be all intent on whatever it is that is \nestablished in your mind as a dominant, \nwholly absorbing idea.”\nThis advice comes from Antonin- \nDalmace Sertillanges, a Dominican friar \nand professor of moral philosophy, who \nduring the early part of the twentieth \ncentury penned a slim but influential\n\nvolume titled The Intellectual Life.  \nSertillanges wrote the book as a guide to \n“the development and deepening of the \nmind” for those called to make a living \nin the world of ideas. Throughout The \nIntellectual Life , Sertillanges \nrecognizes the necessity of mastering \ncomplicated material and helps prepare \nthe reader for this challenge. For this \nreason, his book proves useful in our \nquest to better understand how people \nquickly master hard (cognitive) skills.\nTo understand Sertillanges’s advice, \nlet’s return to the quote from earlier. In \nthese words, which are echoed in many \nforms in The Intellectual Life ,\nSertillanges argues that to advance your\n\nunderstanding of your field you must \ntackle the relevant topics systematically, \nallowing your “converging rays of \nattention” to uncover the truth latent in \neach. In other words, he teaches: To \nlearn requires intense concentration.  \nThis idea turns out to be ahead of its \ntime. In reflecting on the life of the mind \nin the 1920s, Sertillanges uncovered a \nfact about mastering cognitively \ndemanding tasks that would take \nacademia another seven decades to \nformalize.\nThis task of formalization began in \nearnest in the 1970s, when a branch of \npsychology, sometimes called \nperformance psychology, began to\n\nsystematically explore what separates \nexperts (in many different fields) from \neveryone else. In the early 1990s, K. \nAnders Ericsson, a professor at Florida \nState University, pulled together these \nstrands into a single coherent answer, \nconsistent with the growing research \nliterature, that he gave a punchy name: \ndeliberate practice.\nEricsson opens his seminal paper on \nthe topic with a powerful claim: “We \ndeny that these differences [between \nexpert performers and normal adults] are \nimmutable... Instead, we argue that the \ndifferences between expert performers \nand normal adults reflect a life-long \nperiod of deliberate effort to improve\n\nperformance in a specific domain.” \nAmerican culture, in particular, loves \nthe storyline of the prodigy (“Do you \nknow how easy this is for me!?” Matt \nDamon’s character famously cries in the \nmovie Good Will Hunting  as he makes \nquick work of proofs that stymie the \nworld’s top mathematicians). The line of \nresearch promoted by Ericsson, and now\nwidely accepted (with caveats -), de­\nstabilizes these myths. To master a \ncognitively demanding task requires this \nspecific form of practice—there are few \nexceptions made for natural talent.

    "text": " myths. To master a \ncognitively demanding task requires this \nspecific form of practice—there are few \nexceptions made for natural talent. (On \nthis point too, Sertillanges seems to have \nbeen ahead of his time, arguing in The \nIntellectual Life , “Men of genius\n\nthemselves were great only by bringing \nall their power to bear on the point on \nwhich they had decided to show their \nfull measure.” Ericsson couldn’t have \nsaid it better.)\nThis brings us to the question of what \ndeliberate practice actually requires. Its \ncore components are usually identified \nas follows: (1) your attention is focused \ntightly on a specific skill you’re trying to \nimprove or an idea you’re trying to \nmaster; (2) you receive feedback so you \ncan correct your approach to keep your \nattention exactly where it’s most \nproductive. The first component is of \nparticular importance to our discussion, \nas it emphasizes that deliberate practice\n\ncannot exist alongside distraction, and \nthat it instead requires uninterrupted \nconcentration. As Ericsson emphasizes, \n“Diffused attention is almost antithetical \nto the focused attention  required by \ndeliberate practice” (emphasis mine).\nAs psychologists, Ericsson and the \nother researchers in his field are not \ninterested in why deliberate practice \nworks; they’re just identifying it as an \neffective behavior. In the intervening \ndecades since Ericsson’s first major \npapers on the topic, however, \nneuroscientists have been exploring the \nphysical mechanisms that drive people’s \nimprovements on hard tasks. As the \njournalist Daniel Coyle surveys in his\n\n2009 book, The Talent Code , these \nscientists increasingly believe the \nanswer includes myelin—a layer of fatty \ntissue that grows around neurons, acting \nlike an insulator that allows the cells to \nfire faster and cleaner. To understand the \nrole of myelin in improvement, keep in \nmind that skills, be they intellectual or \nphysical, eventually reduce down to \nbrain circuits. This new science of \nperformance argues that you get better at \na skill as you develop more myelin \naround the relevant neurons, allowing \nthe corresponding circuit to fire more \neffortlessly and effectively. To be great \nat something is to be well myelinated.\nThis understanding is important\n\nbecause it provides a neurological \nfoundation for why deliberate practice \nworks. By focusing intensely on a \nspecific skill, you’re forcing the specific \nrelevant circuit to fire, again and again, \nin isolation. This repetitive use of a \nspecific circuit triggers cells called \noligodendrocytes to begin wrapping \nlayers of myelin around the neurons in \nthe circuits— effectively cementing the \nskill.

This is an absurdly high \nrate for his field (in which professors \ntend to work alone or in small \nprofessional collaborations and do not \nhave large teams of students and\n\npostdocs to support their research). In \n2013, this count fell to five. This is still \nabsurdly high, but below his recent \nstandards. He can be excused for this \ndip, however, because this same year he \npublished a book titled Give and Take , \nwhich popularized some of his research \non relationships in business. To say that \nthis book was successful is an \nunderstatement. It ended up featured on \nthe cover of the New York Times  \nMagazine  and went on to become a \nmassive bestseller. When Grant was \nawarded full professorship in 2014, he \nhad already written more than sixty \npeer-reviewed publications in addition \nto his bestselling book.\n\nSoon after meeting Grant, my own \nacademic career on my mind, I couldn’t \nhelp but ask him about his productivity. \nFortunately for me, he was happy to \nshare his thoughts on the subject. It turns \nout that Grant thinks a lot about the \nmechanics of producing at an elite level. \nHe sent me, for example, a collection of \nPowerPoint slides from a workshop he \nattended with several other professors in \nhis field. The event was focused on \ndata-driven observations about how to \nproduce academic work at an optimum \nrate. These slides included detailed pie \ncharts of time allocation per season, a \nflowchart capturing relationship \ndevelopment with co-authors, and a\n\nsuggested reading list with more than \ntwenty titles. These business professors \ndo not live the cliche of the \nabsentminded academic lost in books \nand occasionally stumbling on a big \nidea. They see productivity as a \nscientific problem to systematically \nsolve— a goal Adam Grant seems to \nhave achieved.\nThough Grant’s productivity depends \non many factors, there’s one idea in \nparticular that seems central to his \nmethod: the batching of hard but\nimportant intellectual work into long, \nuninterrupted stretches. Grant performs \nthis batching at multiple levels. Within \nthe year, he stacks his teaching into the\n\nfall semester, during which he can turn \nall of his attention to teaching well and \nbeing available to his students. (This \nmethod seems to work, as Grant is \ncurrently the highest-rated teacher at \nWharton and the winner of multiple \nteaching awards.)

    "text": " \nencountered this formulaic conception of \nproductivity. It first came to my attention \nwhen I was researching my second book, \nHow to Become a Straight-A Student , \nmany years earlier. During that research \nprocess, I interviewed around fifty ultra­\nhigh-scoring college undergraduates \nfrom some of the country’s most \ncompetitive schools. Something I \nnoticed in these interviews is that the \nvery best students often studied less than\n\nthe group of students right below them \non the GPA rankings. One of the \nexplanations for this phenomenon turned \nout to be the formula detailed earlier: \nThe best students understood the role \nintensity plays in productivity and \ntherefore went out of their way to \nmaximize their concentration—radically \nreducing the time required to prepare for \ntests or write papers, without \ndiminishing the quality of their results.\nThe example of Adam Grant implies \nthat this intensity formula applies beyond \njust undergraduate GPA and is also \nrelevant to other cognitively demanding \ntasks. But why would this be? An \ninteresting explanation comes from\n\nSophie Leroy, a business professor at the \nUniversity of Minnesota. In a 2009 \npaper, titled, intriguingly, “Why Is It So \nHard to Do My Work?,” Leroy \nintroduced an effect she called attention  \nresidue.  In the introduction to this paper, \nshe noted that other researchers have \nstudied the effect of multitasking—trying \nto accomplish multiple tasks \nsimultaneously—on performance, but \nthat in the modern knowledge work \noffice, once you got to a high enough \nlevel, it was more common to find \npeople working on multiple projects \nsequentially: “Going from one meeting \nto the next, starting to work on one \nproject and soon after having to\n\ntransition to another is just part of life in \norganizations,” Leroy explains.\nThe problem this research identifies \nwith this work strategy is that when you \nswitch from some Task A to another Task \nB, your attention doesn’t immediately \nfollow— a residue  of your attention \nremains stuck thinking about the original \ntask. This residue gets especially thick if \nyour work on Task A was unbounded \nand of low intensity before you \nswitched, but even if you finish Task A \nbefore moving on, your attention remains \ndivided for a while.\nLeroy studied the effect of this \nattention residue on performance by \nforcing task switches in the laboratory.\n\nIn one such experiment, for example, she \nstarted her subjects working on a set of \nword puzzles. In one of the trials, she \nwould interrupt them and tell them that \nthey needed to move on to a new and \nchallenging task, in this case, reading \nresumes and making hypothetical hiring \ndecisions.

Even worse, by seeing \nmessages that you cannot deal with at the \nmoment (which is almost always the \ncase), you’ll be forced to turn back to \nthe primary task with a secondary task \nleft unfinished. The attention residue left \nby such unresolved switches dampens \nyour performance.\nWhen we step back from these \nindividual observations, we see a clear \nargument form: To produce at your peak \nlevel you need to work for extended \nperiods with full concentration on a \nsingle task free from distraction. Put\n\nanother way, the type of work that  \noptimizes your performance is deep  \nwork. If you’re not comfortable going \ndeep for extended periods of time, it’ll \nbe difficult to get your performance to \nthe peak levels of quality and quantity \nincreasingly necessary to thrive \nprofessionally. Unless your talent and \nskills absolutely dwarf those of your \ncompetition, the deep workers among \nthem will outproduce you.\nWhat About Jack Dorsey?\nI’ve now made my argument for why \ndeep work supports abilities that are\n\nbecoming increasingly important in our \neconomy. Before we accept this \nconclusion, however, we must face a \ntype of question that often arises when I \ndiscuss this topic: What about Jack  \nDorsey?\nJack Dorsey helped found Twitter. \nAfter stepping down as CEO, he then \nlaunched the payment-processing \ncompany Square. To quote a Forbes \nprofile: “He is a disrupter on a massive \nscale and a repeat offender.” He is also \nsomeone who does not spend a lot of \ntime in a state of deep work. Dorsey \ndoesn’t have the luxury of long periods \nof uninterrupted thinking because, at the \ntime when the Forbes profile was\n\nwritten, he maintained management \nduties at both Twitter (where he \nremained chairman) and Square, leading \nto a tightly calibrated schedule that \nensures that the companies have a \npredictable “weekly cadence” (and that \nalso ensures that Dorsey’s time and \nattention are severely fractured).\nDorsey reports, for example, that he \nends the average day with thirty to forty \nsets of meeting notes that he reviews and \nfilters at night. In the small spaces \nbetween all these meetings, he believes \nin serendipitous availability. “I do a lot \nof my work at stand-up tables, which \nanyone can come up to,” Dorsey said. “I \nget to hear all these conversations\n\naround the company.”\nThis style of work is not deep. To use \na term from our previous section, \nDorsey’s attention residue is likely \nslathered on thick as he darts from one \nmeeting to another, letting people \ninterrupt him freely in the brief \ninterludes in between. And yet, we \ncannot say that Dorsey’s work is \nshallow, because shallow work, as \ndefined in the introduction, is low value \nand easily replicable, while what Jack \nDorsey does is incredibly valuable and \nhighly rewarded in our economy (as of \nthis writing he was among the top one \nthousand richest people in the world, \nwith a net worth over $1.1 billion).\n\nJack Dorsey is important to our \ndiscussion because he’s an exemplar of \na group we cannot ignore: individuals \nwho thrive without depth. When I titled \nthe motivating question of this section \n“What About Jack Dorsey?,” I was \nproviding a specific example of a more \ngeneral query: If deep work is so \nimportant, why are there distracted \npeople who do well? To conclude this \nchapter, I want to address this question \nso it doesn’t nag at your attention as we \ndive deeper into the topic of depth in the \npages ahead.\nTo start, we must first note that Jack \nDorsey is a high-level executive of a \nlarge company (two companies, in fact).\n\nIndividuals with such positions play a \nmajor role in the category of those who \nthrive without depth, because the \nlifestyle of such executives is famously \nand unavoidably distracted. Here’s \nKerry Trainor, CEO of Vimeo, trying to \nanswer the question of how long he can \ngo without e-mail: “I can go a good \nsolid Saturday without, without... well, \nmost of the daytime without i t .  I mean, \nI’ll check it,  but I won’t necessarily \nrespond.”\nAt the same time, of course, these \nexecutives are better compensated and \nmore important in the American \neconomy today than in any other time in \nhistory. Jack Dorsey’s success without\n\ndepth is common at this elite level of \nmanagement.

    "text": " without\n\ndepth is common at this elite level of \nmanagement. Once we’ve stipulated this \nreality, we must then step back to remind \nourselves that it doesn’t undermine the \ngeneral value of depth. Why? Because \nthe necessity of distraction in these \nexecutives’  work lives is highly specific \nto their particular jobs. A good chief \nexecutive is essentially a hard-to- \nautomate decision engine, not unlike \nIBM’s Jeopardy !-playing Watson \nsystem They have built up a hard-won \nrepository of experience and have honed \nand proved an instinct for their market. \nThey’re then presented inputs throughout \nthe day—in the form of e-mails, \nmeetings, site visits, and the like—that\n\nthey must process and act on. To ask a \nCEO to spend four hours thinking deeply \nabout a single problem is a waste of \nwhat makes him or her valuable. It’s \nbetter to hire three smart subordinates to \nthink deeply about the problem and then \nbring their solutions to the executive for \na final decision.\nThis specificity is important because \nit tells us that if you’re a high-level \nexecutive at a major company, you \nprobably don’t need the advice in the \npages that follow. On the other hand, it \nalso tells us that you cannot extrapolate \nthe approach of these executives to other  \njobs. The fact that Dorsey encourages \ninterruption or Kerry Trainor checks his\n\ne-mail constantly doesn’t mean that \nyou’ll share their success if you follow \nsuit: Their behaviors are characteristic \nof their specific roles as corporate \nofficers.\nThis rule of specificity should be \napplied to similar counterexamples that \ncome to mind while reading the rest of \nthis book. There are, we must \ncontinually remember, certain corners of \nour economy where depth is not valued. \nIn addition to executives, we can also \ninclude, for example, certain types of \nsalesmen and lobbyists, for whom \nconstant connection is their most valued \ncurrency. There are even those who \nmanage to grind out distracted success in\n\nfields where depth would help.\nBut at the same time, don’t be too \nhasty to label your job as necessarily \nnon-deep. Just because your current \nhabits make deep work difficult doesn’t \nmean that this lack of depth is \nfundamental to doing your job well. In \nthe next chapter, for example, I tell the \nstory of a group of high-powered \nmanagement consultants who were \nconvinced that constant e-mail \nconnectivity was necessary for them to \nservice their clients. When a Harvard \nprofessor forced them to disconnect \nmore regularly (as part of a research \nstudy), they found, to their surprise, that \nthis connectivity didn’t matter nearly as\n\nmuch as they had assumed. The clients \ndidn’t really need to reach them at all \ntimes and their performance as\nconsultants improved  once their attention \nbecame less fractured.\nSimilarly, several managers I know \ntried to convince me that they’re most \nvaluable when they’re able to respond \nquickly to their teams’  problems,\npreventing project logjams. They see \ntheir role as enabling others’\nproductivity, not necessarily protecting \ntheir own. Follow-up discussions,\nhowever, soon uncovered that this goal \ndidn’t really  require attention-fracturing \nconnectivity. Indeed, many software \ncompanies now deploy the Scrum\n\nproject management methodology, which \nreplaces a lot of this ad hoc messaging \nwith regular, highly structured, and \nruthlessly efficient status meetings (often \nheld standing up to minimize the urge to \nbloviate). This approach frees up more \nmanagerial time for thinking deeply \nabout the problems their teams are \ntackling, often improving the overall \nvalue of what they produce.\nPut another way: Deep work is not \nthe only skill valuable in our economy, \nand it’s possible to do well without \nfostering this ability, but the niches \nwhere this is advisable are increasingly \nrare. Unless you have strong evidence \nthat distraction is important for your\n\nspecific profession, you’re best served, \nfor the reasons argued earlier in this \nchapter, by giving serious consideration \nto depth.",
