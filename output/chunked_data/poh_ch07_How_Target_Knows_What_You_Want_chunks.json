His entire life revolved around using data \nto understand people. He had grown up in a small North Dakota town, and while his friends were attending 4-H or building model rockets, Pole was playing with computers. After college, he got a grad-uate degree in statistics and then another in economics, and while most of his classmates in the econ program at the University of Mis-souri were headed to insurance companies or government bureaucra-cies, Pole was on a different track. He’d become obsessed with the ways economists were using pattern analysis to explain human be-havior. Pole, in fact, had tried his hand at a few informal experiments \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   182 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   182 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nHow Target Knows What You Want Before You Do ● 183\nhimself. He once threw a party and polled everyone on their favorite \njokes, and then attempted to create a mathematical model for the per-fect  one- liner. He has tried calculating the exact amount of beer he needed to drink in order to work up the conﬁ  dence to talk to women \nat parties, but not so much that he would make a fool of himself. (That particular study never seemed to come out right.)\nBut those experiments were child’s play, he knew, to how corpo-\nrate America was using data to scrutinize people’s lives. Pole wanted in. So when he graduated and heard that Hallmark, the greeting card company, was looking to hire statisticians in Kansas City, he submitted an application and was soon spending his days scouring sales data to determine if pictures of pandas or elephants sold more birthday cards, and if “What Happens at Grandma’s Stays at Grand-ma’s” is funnier in red or blue ink. It was heaven.\nSix years later, in 2002, when Pole learned that Target was look-\ning for number crunchers, he made the jump. Target, he knew, was a whole other order of magnitude when it came to data collection. Every year, millions of shoppers walked into Target’s 1,147 stores and handed over terabytes of information about themselves. Most had no idea they were doing it. They used their customer loyalty cards, redeemed coupons they had received in the mail, or used a credit card, unaware that Target could then link their purchases to an individualized demographic proﬁ  le.\nTo a statistician, this data was a magic window for peering into \ncustomers’ preferences. Target sold everything from groceries to clothing, electronics and lawn furniture, and by closely tracking people’s buying habits, the company’s analysts could predict what was occurring within their homes. Someone’s buying new towels, sheets, silverware, pans, and frozen dinners? They probably just bought a new  house— or are getting a divorce. A cart loaded up with bug spray, kids’ underwear, a ﬂ  ashlight, lots of batteries, Real Sim-\nple, and a bottle of Chardonnay? Summer camp is around the corner \nand Mom can hardly wait.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   183 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   183 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n184 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nWorking at Target offered Pole a chance to study the most com-\nplicated of  creatures— the American  shopper— in its natural habi-tat. His job was to build mathematical models that could crawl through data and determine which households contained kids and which were dedicated bachelors; which shoppers loved the outdoors and who was more interested in ice cream and romance novels. Pole’s mandate was to become a mathematical mind reader, deci-phering shoppers’ habits in order to convince them to spend more.\nThen, one afternoon, a few of Pole’s colleagues from the market-\ning department stopped by his desk.

Pregnant women and new parents, after all, are the holy grail of retail. There is almost no more proﬁ  table,  product- \nhungry,  price- insensitive group in existence. It’s not just diapers and wipes. People with infants are so tired that they’ll buy everything they  need— juice and toilet paper, socks and  magazines—wherever they purchase their bottles and formula.

They’re fairly primitive,  one- size- ﬁ  ts- all \nsolutions for triggering buying habits.\nIn the past two decades, however, as the retail marketplace has \nbecome more and more competitive, chains such as Target began to understand they couldn ’t rely on the same old bag of tricks. The only way to increase proﬁ  ts was to ﬁ  gure out each individual shopper’s \nhabits and to market to people one by one, with personalized pitches designed to appeal to customers’ unique buying preferences.\nIn part, this realization came from a growing awareness of how \npowerfully habits inﬂ  uence almost every shopping decision. A se-\nries of experiments convinced marketers that if they managed to understand a particular shopper’s habits, they could get them to buy almost anything. One study  tape- recorded consumers as they walked through grocery stores. Researchers wanted to know how people made buying decisions. In particular, they looked for shoppers who had come with shopping  lists— who, theoretically, had decided ahead of time what they wanted to get.\nWhat they discovered was that despite those lists, more than 50 \npercent of purchasing decisions occurred at the moment a customer saw a product on the shelf, because, despite shoppers’ best inten-tions, their habits were stronger than their written intentions. “Let’s see,” one shopper muttered to himself as he walked through a store. “Here are the chips. I will skip them. Wait a minute. Oh! The Lay’s potato chips are on sale!” He put a bag in his cart.

Target can purchase data that indicates a shopper’s ethnicity, their job history, what magazines they read, if they have ever declared bankruptcy, the year they bought (or lost) their house, where they went to college or graduate school, and whether they prefer certain brands of coffee, toilet paper, cereal, or applesauce.\nThere are data peddlers such as Inﬁ  niGraph that “listen ” to shop-\npers’ online conversations on message boards and Internet forums, and track which products people mention favorably. A ﬁ  rm named \nRapleaf sells information on shoppers’ political leanings, reading habits, charitable giving, the number of cars they own, and whether they prefer religious news or deals on cigarettes. Other companies analyze photos that consumers post online, cataloging if they are obese or skinny, short or tall, hairy or bald, and what kinds of prod-ucts they might want to buy as a result. (Target, in a statement, de-clined to indicate what demographic companies it does business with and what kinds of information it studies.)\n“It used to be that companies only knew what their customers \nwanted them to know,” said Tom Davenport, one of the leading re-\nsearchers on how businesses use data and analytics. “That world is far behind us.

Pole and the ﬁ  fty other members of Target’s Guest Data and Ana-\nlytical Services department were the ones who found the habits hid-den in the facts.\n“We call it the ‘guest portrait,’” Pole told me. “The more I know \nabout someone, the better I can guess their buying patterns. I’m not going to guess everything about you every time, but I’ll be right more often than I’m wrong.”\nBy the time Pole joined Target in 2002, the analytics department \nhad already built computer programs to identify households con-taining children and, come each November, send their parents cata-logs of bicycles and scooters that would look perfect under the Christmas tree, as well as coupons for school supplies in September and advertisements for pool toys in June. The computers looked for shoppers buying bikinis in April, and sent them coupons for sun-screen in July and weight-loss books in December. If it wanted, Tar-get could send each customer a coupon book ﬁ  lled with discounts \nfor products they were fairly certain the shoppers were going to buy, because they had already purchased those exact items before.\nTarget isn ’t alone in its desire to predict consumers’ habits. Al-\nmost every major retailer, including Amazon.com, Best Buy, Kroger supermarkets, 1-800-Flowers, Olive Garden,  Anheuser- Busch, the U.S. Postal Service, Fidelity Investments,  Hewlett- Packard, Bank of America, Capital One, and hundreds of others, have “predictive ana-lytics” departments devoted to ﬁ  guring out consumers’ preferences. \n“But Target has always been one of the smartest at this,” said Eric \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   190 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   190 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nHow Target Knows What You Want Before You Do ● 191\nSiegel, who runs a conference called Predictive Analytics World. \n“The data doesn ’t mean anything on its own. Target’s good at ﬁ  gur-\ning out the really clever questions.”\nIt doesn ’t take a genius to know that someone buying cereal prob-\nably also needs milk.

Consumers going through major life events often don ’t notice, or care, that their shopping patterns have shifted. However, retailers notice, and they care quite a bit.\n“Changing residence, getting married or divorced, losing or \nchanging a job, having someone enter or leave the household,” An-dreasen wrote, are life changes that make consumers more “vulner-able to intervention by marketers.”\nAnd what’s the biggest life event for most people? What causes \nthe greatest disruption and “vulnerability to marketing interven-tions”? Having a baby. There’s almost no greater upheaval for most customers than the arrival of a child. As a result, new parents’ habits are more ﬂ  exible at that moment than at almost any other period in \nan adult’s life.\nSo for companies, pregnant women are gold mines.New parents buy lots of  stuff— diapers and wipes, cribs and One-\nsies, blankets and  bottles— that stores such as Target sell at a sig-niﬁ cant proﬁ  t. One survey conducted in 2010 estimated that the \naverage parent spends $6,800 on baby items before a child’s ﬁ  rst \nbirthday.\nBut that’s just the tip of the shopping iceberg. Those initial ex-\npenditures are peanuts compared with the proﬁ  ts a store can earn \nby taking advantage of a new parent’s shifting shopping habits. If exhausted moms and  sleep- deprived dads start purchasing baby formula and diapers at Target, they’ll start buying their groceries, cleaning supplies, towels, underwear,  and— well, the sky’s the  limit— from Target as well. Because it’s easy. To a new parent, easy matters most of all.\n“ As soon as we get them buying diapers from us, they’re going to \nstart buying everything else, too,” Pole told me. “If you’re rushing through the store, looking for bottles, and you pass orange juice, \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   192 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   192 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nHow Target Knows What You Want Before You Do ● 193\nyou’ll grab a carton. Oh, and there’s that new DVD I want. Soon, \nyou’ll be buying cereal and paper towels from us, and keep coming back.”\nNew parents are so valuable that major retailers will do almost \nanything to ﬁ  nd them, including going inside maternity wards, \neven if their products have nothing to do with infants. One New York hospital, for instance, provides every new mother with a gift bag containing samples of hair gel, face wash, shaving cream, an energy bar, shampoo, and a  soft- cotton  T- shirt. Inside are coupons for an online photo service, hand soap, and a local gym. There are also samples of diapers and baby lotions, but they’re lost among the nonbaby supplies. In 580 hospitals across the United States, new mothers get gifts from the Walt Disney Company, which in 2010 started a division speciﬁ  cally aimed at marketing to the parents of \ninfants. Procter & Gamble,  Fisher- Price, and other ﬁ  rms have simi-\nlar  giveaway programs. Disney estimates the North American new baby market is worth $36.3 billion a year.\nBut for companies such as Target, approaching new moms in the \nmaternity ward is, in some senses, too late.

Suspecting and knowing, however, are two different things. How do you know whether someone buying diapers is pregnant or buying a gift for a pregnant friend? What’s more, timing matters. A coupon that’s useful a month before the due date might get put in the trash a few weeks after the baby ar-rives.\nPole started working on the problem by scouring the informa-\ntion in Target’s baby shower registry, which let him observe how the average woman ’s shopping habits changed as her due date ap-proached. The registry was like a laboratory where he could test hunches. Each expectant mother handed over her name, her spouse’s name, and her due date. Target’s data warehouse could link that information to the family’s Guest IDs. As a result, whenever one of these women purchased something in a store or online, Pole, using the due date the woman provided, could plot the trimester in which the purchase occurred. Before long, he was picking up pat-terns.\nExpectant mothers, he discovered, shopped in fairly predictable \nways. Take, for example, lotions. Lots of people buy lotion, but a Target data analyst noticed that women on the baby registry were buying unusually large quantities of unscented lotion around the beginning of their second trimester. Another analyst noted that sometime in the ﬁ  rst twenty weeks, many pregnant women loaded \nup on vitamins, such as calcium, magnesium, and zinc. Lots of shoppers purchase soap and cotton balls every month, but when someone suddenly starts buying lots of  scent- free soap and cotton balls, in addition to hand sanitizers and an astounding number of washcloths, all at once, a few months after buying lotions and mag-nesium and zinc, it signals they are getting close to their delivery date.\nAs Pole’s computer program crawled through the data, he was \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   194 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   194 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nHow Target Knows What You Want Before You Do ● 195\nable to identify about  twenty- ﬁ  ve different products that, when ana-\nlyzed together, allowed him to, in a sense, peer inside a woman ’s womb. Most important, he could guess what trimester she was  in— and estimate her due  date— so Target could send her coupons when she was on the brink of making new purchases. By the time Pole was done, his program could assign almost any regular shop-per a “pregnancy prediction ” score.\nJenny Ward, a  twenty- three- year- old in Atlanta who bought cocoa \nbutter lotion, a purse large enough to double as a diaper bag, zinc, magnesium, and a bright blue rug? There’s an 87 percent chance that she’s pregnant and that her delivery date is sometime in late August. Liz Alter in Brooklyn, a  thirty- ﬁ  ve- year- old who purchased \nﬁ ve packs of washcloths, a bottle of “sensitive skin ” laundry deter-\ngent, baggy jeans, vitamins containing DHA, and a slew of moistur-izers? She’s got a 96 percent chance of pregnancy, and she’ll probably give birth in early May. Caitlin Pike, a  thirty- nine- year-old in San Francisco who purchased a $250 stroller, but nothing else? She’s probably buying for a friend’s baby shower. Besides, her demo-graphic data shows she got divorced two years ago.\nPole applied his program to every shopper in Target’s database. \nWhen it was done, he had a list of hundreds of thousands of women who were likely to be pregnant that Target could inundate with ad-vertisements for diapers, lotions, cribs, wipes, and maternity cloth-ing at times when their shopping habits were particularly ﬂ  exible. If \na fraction of those women or their husbands started doing their shopping at Target, it would add millions to the company’s bottom line.\nThen, just as this advertising avalanche was about to begin, \nsomeone within the marketing department asked a question: How are women going to react when they ﬁ  gure out how much Target \nknows?\n“If we send someone a catalog",

But even if you’re following the law, you can do things where people get queasy.”\nThere’s good reason for such worries. About a year after Pole cre-\nated his pregnancy prediction model, a man walked into a Minne-sota Target and demanded to see the manager. He was clutching an advertisement. He was very angry.\n“My daughter got this in the mail!” he said. “She’s still in high \nschool, and you’re sending her coupons for baby clothes and cribs? Are you trying to encourage her to get pregnant?”\nThe manager didn ’t have any idea what the man was talking \nabout. He looked at the mailer. Sure enough, it was addressed to the man ’s daughter and contained advertisements for maternity cloth-ing, nursery furniture, and pictures of smiling infants gazing into their mothers’ eyes.\nThe manager apologized profusely, and then called, a few days \nlater, to apologize again.\nThe father was somewhat abashed.“I had a talk with my daughter,” he said. “It turns out there’s \nbeen some activities in my house I haven ’t been completely aware of.” He took a deep breath. “She’s due in August. I owe you an apol-ogy.”\nTarget is not the only ﬁ  rm to have raised concerns among con-\nsumers. Other companies have been attacked for using data in far less intrusive ways. In 2011, for instance, a New York resident sued McDonald’s, CBS, Mazda, and Microsoft, alleging those companies’ advertising agency monitored people’s Internet usage to proﬁ  le \ntheir buying habits. There are ongoing class action lawsuits in Cali-fornia against Target, Walmart, Victoria’s Secret, and other retail chains for asking customers to give their zip codes when they use credit cards, and then using that information to ferret out their mailing addresses.\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   196 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   196 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nHow Target Knows What You Want Before You Do ● 197\nUsing data to predict a woman ’s pregnancy, Pole and his col-\nleagues knew, was a potential public relations disaster. So how could they get their advertisements into expectant mothers’ hands without making it appear they were spying on them? How do you take ad-vantage of someone’s habits without letting them know you’re studying every detail of their lives?\n*\nII.\nIn the summer of 2003, a promotion executive at Arista Records named Steve Bartels began calling up radio DJs to tell them about a new song he was certain they would love. It was called “Hey Ya!” by the  hip- hop group OutKast.\n“Hey Ya!” was an upbeat fusion of funk, rock, and  hip- hop with a \ndollop of Big Band swing, from one of the most popular bands on earth. It sounded like nothing else on the radio. “It made the hair on my arms stand up the ﬁ  rst time I heard it,” Bartels told me. “It \n*The reporting in this chapter is based on interviews with more than a dozen current and former \nTarget employees, many of them conducted on a not-for-attribution basis because sources feared dismissal from the company or other retribution. Target was provided with an opportunity to review and respond to the reporting in this chapter, and was asked to make executives involved in the Guest Analytics department available for on-the-record interviews. The company declined to do so and declined to respond to fact-checking questions except in two emails. The ﬁ  rst said: “ At Target, our \nmission is to make Target the preferred shopping destination for our guests by delivering outstand-ing value, continuous innovation and an exceptional guest experience by consistently fulﬁ  lling our \n‘Expect More.

This song, they all agreed, is going to be huge.\nThat certainty wasn ’t based solely on intuition. At the time, the \nrecord business was undergoing a transformation similar to the  data- driven shifts occurring at Target and elsewhere. Just as retailers were using computer algorithms to forecast shoppers’ habits, music and radio executives were using computer programs to forecast lis-teners’ habits. A company named Polyphonic  HMI— a collection of artiﬁ cial intelligence experts and statisticians based in  Spain— had \ncreated a program called Hit Song Science that analyzed the math-ematical characteristics of a tune and predicted its popularity. By comparing the tempo, pitch, melody, chord progression, and other factors of a particular song against the thousands of hits stored in Polyphonic HMI’s database, Hit Song Science could deliver a score that forecasted if a tune was likely to succeed.\nThe program had predicted that Norah Jones’s Come Away with  \nMe, for instance,  would be a hit after most of the industry had dis-\nmissed the album. (It went on to sell ten million copies and win eight Grammys.) It had predicted that “Why Don ’t You and I” by Santana would be popular, despite DJs’ doubts. (It reached number three on the Billboard Top 40 list.)\nWhen executives at radio stations ran “Hey Ya!” through Hit \nSong Science, it did well. In fact, it did better than well: The score was among the highest anyone had ever seen.\n“Hey Ya!,” according to the algorithm, was going to be a monster \nhit.\nOn September 4, 2003, in the prominent slot of 7:15 p.m., the \nTop 40 station WIOQ in Philadelphia started playing “Hey Ya!” on the radio. It aired the song seven more times that week, and a total of  thirty- seven times throughout the month.\nAt the time, a company named Arbitron was testing a new tech-\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   198 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   198 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nHow Target Knows What You Want Before You Do ● 199\nnology that made it possible to ﬁ  gure out how many people were \nlistening to a particular radio station at a given moment, and how many switched channels during a speciﬁ  c song. WIOQ was one of \nthe stations included in the test. The station ’s executives were cer-tain “Hey Ya!” would keep listeners glued to their radios.\n",

They would wake up every morning, pick up a package of tapes of stations that had been recorded the previous day in various cities, and count and analyze every song that had been played. Meyer would then publish a weekly newsletter tracking which tunes were rising or declining in popularity.\nIn his ﬁ  rst few years, the newsletter had only about a hundred \nsubscribers, and Meyer and his wife struggled to keep the company aﬂ oat. However, as more and more stations began using Meyer’s \ninsights to increase their  audiences— and, in particular, studying the formulas he devised to explain listening  trends— his newsletter, the data sold by Mediabase, and then similar services provided by a growing industry of  data- focused consultants, overhauled how radio stations were run.\nOne of the puzzles Meyer most loved was ﬁ  guring out why, dur-\ning some songs, listeners never seemed to change the radio dial. Among DJs, these songs are known as “sticky.” Meyer had tracked hundreds of sticky songs over the years, trying to divine the princi-ples that made them popular. His ofﬁ  ce was ﬁ  lled with charts and \ngraphs plotting the characteristics of various sticky songs. Meyer was always looking for new ways to measure stickiness, and about the time “Hey Ya!” was released, he started experimenting with data from the tests that Arbitron was conducting to see if it provided any fresh insights.\nSome of the stickiest songs at the time were sticky for obvious \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   200 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   200 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\nHow Target Knows What You Want Before You Do ● 201\nreasons—“",

They hated it so much that nearly a third of them changed the station within the ﬁ  rst thirty seconds of the song. It wasn ’t only \nat WIOQ, either. Across the nation, at radio stations in Chicago, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and Seattle, whenever “Hey Ya!”  came on, huge \nnumbers of listeners would click off.\n“I thought it was a great song the ﬁ  rst time I heard it,” said John \nGarabedian, the host of a syndicated Top 40 radio show heard by more than two million people each weekend. “But it didn ’t sound like other songs, and so some people went nuts when it came on.

Other songs, though, were sticky for reasons no one could really understand. For instance, when stations played “Breathe” by Blu Cantrell during the summer of 2003, almost no one changed the dial. The song is an eminently forgettable,  beat- driven tune that DJs found so bland that most of them only played it reluctantly, they told music publications. But for some rea-son, whenever it came on the radio, people listened, even if, as poll-sters later discovered, those same listeners said they didn ’t like the song very much. Or consider “Here Without You ” by 3 Doors Down, or almost any song by the group Maroon 5.

Yet whenever they came on the radio, almost no one changed the station.\nThen there were songs that listeners said they actively disliked,  \nbut were sticky nonetheless.

But whenever a Dion tune came on the radio, men stayed tuned in. Within the Los Angeles market, sta-tions that regularly played Dion at the end of each  hour— when Ar-bitron measured  listeners— could reliably boost their audience by as much as 3 percent, a huge ﬁ  gure in the radio world.

However, they all seemed similar in that each sounded exactly like what Meyer expected to hear from that particular genre. They \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   201 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   201 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n202 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nsounded  familiar — like everything else on the  radio— but a little more \npolished, a bit closer to the golden mean of the perfect song.\n“Sometimes stations will do research by calling listeners on the \nphone, and play a snippet of a song, and listeners will say, ‘I’ve heard that a million times. I’m totally tired of it,’” Meyer told me. “But when it comes on the radio, your subconscious says, ‘I know this song! I’ve heard it a million times! I can sing along!’ Sticky songs are what you expect  to hear on the radio. Your brain secretly wants \nthat song, because it’s so familiar to everything else you’ve already heard and liked. It just sounds right.”\nThere is evidence that a preference for things that sound “famil-\niar” is a product of our neurology. Scientists have examined people’s brains as they listen to music, and have tracked which neural re-gions are involved in comprehending aural stimuli. Listening to music activates numerous areas of the brain, including the auditory cortex, the thalamus, and the superior parietal cortex. These same areas are also associated with pattern recognition and helping the brain decide which inputs to pay attention to and which to ignore. The areas that process music, in other words, are designed to seek out patterns and look for familiarity. This makes sense. Music, after all, is complicated. The numerous tones, pitches, overlapping melo-dies, and competing sounds inside almost any  song— or anyone speaking on a busy street, for that  matter— are so overwhelming that, without our brain ’s ability to focus on some sounds and ignore others, everything would seem like a cacophony of noise.\nOur brains crave familiarity in music because familiarity is how \nwe manage to hear without becoming distracted by all the sound. Just as the scientists at MIT discovered that behavioral habits pre-vent us from becoming overwhelmed by the endless decisions we would otherwise have to make each day, listening habits exist be-cause, without them, it would be impossible to determine if we",

But for some rea-son, whenever it came on the radio, people listened, even if, as poll-sters later discovered, those same listeners said they didn ’t like the song very much. Or consider “Here Without You ” by 3 Doors Down, or almost any song by the group Maroon 5. Those bands are so fea-ture",

Listeners are happy to sit through a song they might say they dislike, as long as it seems like something they’ve heard before. Pregnant women are happy to use coupons they receive in the mail, unless those coupons make it ob-vious that Target is spying into their wombs, which is unfamiliar and kind of creepy. Getting a coupon that makes it clear Target knows you’re pregnant is at odds from what a customer expects. It’s like telling a  forty- two- year- old investment banker that he sang along to Celine Dion. It just feels wrong.\nSo how do DJs convince listeners to stick with songs such as \n“Hey Ya!” long enough for them to become familiar? How does Tar-get convince pregnant women to use diaper coupons without creep-ing them out?\nBy dressing something new in old clothes, and making the unfa-\nmiliar seem familiar.\nIII.\nIn the early 1940s, the U.S. government began shipping much of the nation ’s domestic meat supply to Europe and the Paciﬁ  c theater \nto support troops ﬁ  ghting in World War II. Back home, the avail-\nability of steaks and pork chops began to dwindle. By the time the United States entered the war in late 1941, New York restaurants were using horse meat for hamburgers and a black market for poul-try had emerged. Federal ofﬁ  cials became worried that a lengthy war \neffort would leave the nation starved of protein. This “problem will loom larger and larger in the United States as the war goes on,” for-mer president Herbert Hoover wrote to Americans in a government pamphlet in 1943. “Our farms are short of labor to care for livestock; and on top of it all we must furnish supplies to the British and Rus-sians. Meats and fats are just as much munitions in this war as are tanks and aeroplanes.”\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   204 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r",

When Celine Dion releases a new  song— and it sounds like every other song she’s sung, as well as most of the other songs on the  radio— our brains unconsciously crave its recognizability and the song becomes sticky. You might never attend a Celine Dion concert, but you’ll listen to her songs on the radio, because that’s what you expect  to hear as you drive to work. Those songs correspond per-\nfectly to your habits.\nThis insight helped explain why “Hey Ya!” was failing on the \nradio, despite the fact that Hit Song Science and music executives were sure it would be a hit. The problem wasn ’t that “Hey Ya!” was bad. The problem was that “Hey Ya!” wasn ’t familiar . Radio listeners \ndidn ’t want to make a conscious decision each time they were pre-sented with a new song. Instead, their brains wanted to follow a habit. Much of the time, we don ’t actually choose if we like or dislike a song. It would take too much mental effort. Instead, we react to the cues (“This sounds like all the other songs I’ve ever liked”) and rewards (“It’s fun to",

A  middle- class \nwoman in 1940 would sooner starve than despoil her table with tongue or tripe. So when the scientists recruited into the Committee on Food Habits met for the ﬁ  rst time in 1941, they set themselves a \ngoal of systematically identifying the cultural barriers that discour-aged Americans from eating organ meat. In all, more than two hun-dred studies were eventually published, and at their core, they all contained a similar ﬁ  nding: To change people’s diets, the exotic \nmust be made familiar.

For instance, when the Subsis-tence Division of the Quartermaster  Corps— the people in charge of feeding  soldiers—started serving fresh cabbage to troops in 1943, it was rejected. So mess halls chopped and boiled the cabbage until it looked like every other vegetable on a soldier’s  tray— and the troops ate it without complaint. “Soldiers were more likely to eat food, whether familiar or unfamiliar, when it was prepared similar to their prior experiences and served in a familiar fashion,” a  present- day researcher evaluating those studies wrote.\nThe secret to changing the American diet, the Committee on \nFood Habits concluded, was familiarity. Soon, housewives were re-ceiving mailers from the government telling them “every husband \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   205 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   205 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n206 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nwill cheer for steak and kidney pie.” Butchers started handing out \nrecipes that explained how to slip liver into meatloaf.\nA few years after World War II ended, the Committee on Food \nHabits was dissolved. By then, however, organ meats had been fully integrated into the American diet. One study indicated that offal consumption rose by 33 percent during the war. By 1955, it was up 50 percent. Kidney had become a staple at dinner. Liver was for spe-cial occasions. America’s dining patterns had shifted to such a de-gree that organ meats had become emblems of comfort.\nSince then, the U.S. government has launched dozens of other \nefforts to improve our diets. For example, there was the “Five a Day” campaign, intended to encourage people to eat ﬁ  ve fruits or vegeta-\nbles, the USDA’s food pyramid, and a push for  low- fat cheeses and milks. None of them adhered to the committee’s ﬁ  ndings. None \ntried to camouﬂ  age their recommendations in existing habits, and \nas a result, all of the campaigns failed. To date, the only government program ever to cause a lasting change in the American diet was the organ meat push of the 1940s.\nHowever, radio stations and massive  companies— including \n Target— are a bit savvier.\n● ● ●\nTo make “Hey Ya!”  a hit, DJs soon realized, they needed to make the \nsong feel familiar. And to do that, something special was required.\nThe problem was that computer programs such as Hit Song Sci-\nence were pretty good at predicting people’s habits. But sometimes, those algorithms found habits that hadn ’t actually emerged yet, and when companies market to habits we haven ’t adopted or, even worse, are unwilling to admit to  ourselves— like our",

And to become part of a habit, it had to be slightly camouﬂ  aged at ﬁ  rst, the same way housewives camouﬂ  aged liver by \nslipping it into meatloaf. So at WIOQ in  Philadelphia— as well as at other stations around the  nation— DJs started making sure that whenever “Hey Ya!” was played, it was sandwiched between songs that were already popular. “It’s textbook playlist theory,” said Tom Webster, a radio consultant. “Play a new song between two consen-sus popular hits.”\nDJs, however, didn ’t air “Hey Ya!” alongside just any kind of hit. \nThey sandwiched it between the types of songs that Rich Meyer had discovered were uniquely sticky, from artists like Blu Cantrell, 3 Doors Down, Maroon 5, and Christina Aguilera. (Some stations, in fact, were so eager they used the same song twice.)\nConsider, for instance, the WIOQ playlist for September 19, \n2003:Your Favorite Song #1\nYour Favorite Song #2\nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   207 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   207 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n208 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\n11:43  “Here Without You ” by 3 Doors Down\n11:54  “Breathe” by Blu Cantrell11:58  “Hey Ya!” by OutKast12:01  “Breathe” by Blu Cantrell\nOr the playlist for October 16:9:41 “Harder to Breathe” by Maroon 5\n9:45 “Hey Ya!” by OutKast9:49 “Can ’t Hold Us Down ” by Christina Aguilera10:00 “Frontin ’” by Pharrell\nNovember 12:9:58 “Here Without You ” by 3 Doors Down\n10:01 “Hey Ya!” by OutKast10:05 “Like I Love You ” by Justin Timberlake10:09 “Baby Boy” by Beyoncé\n“Managing a playlist is all about risk mitigation,” said Webster. \n“Stations have to take risks on new songs, otherwise people stop listening. But what listeners really want are songs they already like. So you have to make new songs seem familiar as fast as possible.”\nWhen WIOQ ﬁ  rst started playing “Hey Ya!” in early \n September— before the sandwiching started—26.6 percent of lis-teners changed the station whenever it came on. By October, after playing it alongside sticky hits, that  “tune- out factor” dropped to 13.7 percent. By December, it was 5.7 percent. Other major radio stations around the nation used the same sandwiching technique, and the  tune- out rate followed the same pattern.\nAnd as listeners heard “Hey Ya!” again and again, it became fa-\nmiliar. Once the song had become popular, WIOQ was playing “Hey Ya!” as many as ﬁ  fteen times a day. People’s listening habits had \nshifted to  expect— crave, even—“Hey Ya!” A “Hey Ya!” habit emerged. The song went on",

Then we started mixing in all these ads for things we knew pregnant women would never buy, so the baby ads looked random. We’d put an ad for a lawnmower next to diapers.

She just assumes that \neveryone else on her block got the same mailer for diapers and cribs. As long as we don ’t spook her, it works.”\nThe answer to Target and Pole’s  question— how do you advertise \nto a pregnant woman without revealing that you know she’s preg-nant?—was essentially the same one that DJs used to hook listeners on “Hey Ya!” Target started sandwiching the diaper coupons be-tween  nonpregnancy products that made the advertisements seem anonymous, familiar, comfortable. They camouﬂ  aged what they \nknew.\nSoon, Target’s “Mom and Baby” sales exploded. The company \ndoesn ’t break out sales ﬁ  gures for speciﬁ  c divisions, but between \n2002—when Pole was  hired— and 2009, Target’s revenues grew from $44 billion to $65 billion. In 2005, the company’s president, Gregg Steinhafel, boasted to a room full of investors about the com-pany’s “heightened focus on items and categories that appeal to spe-ciﬁ c guest segments such as mom and baby.\n“ As our database tools grow increasingly sophisticated, Target \nMail has come into its own as a useful tool for promoting value and convenience to speciﬁ  c guest segments such as new moms or \nteens,” he said. “For example, Target Baby is able to track life stages from prenatal care to car seats and strollers. In 2004, the Tar-get Baby Direct Mail Program drove sizable increases in trips and sales.”\nWhether selling a new song, a new food, or a new crib, the lesson \nis the same: If you dress a new something in old habits, it’s easier for the public to accept it.\nIV.\nThe usefulness of this lesson isn ’t limited to large corporations, gov",

They asked a social scientist and  a mathematician— Bill Lazarus and Dean  Abbott— for help.\nThe two men gathered data from more than 150,000 YMCA \nmember satisfaction surveys that had been collected over the years and started looking for patterns. At that point, the accepted wisdom among YMCA executives was that people wanted fancy exercise equipment and sparkling, modern facilities. The YMCA had spent millions of dollars building weight rooms and yoga studios. When the surveys were analyzed, however, it turned out that while a facil-ity’s attractiveness and the availability of workout machines might have caused people to join in the ﬁ  rst place, what got them to stay \nwas something else.\nRetention, the data said, was driven by emotional factors, such as \nwhether employees knew members’ names or said hello when they walked in. People, it turns out, often go to the gym looking for a human connection, not a treadmill. If a member made a friend at the YMCA, they were much more likely to show up for workout ses-sions. In other words, people who join the YMCA have certain social habits. If the YMCA satisﬁ  ed them, members were happy. So if the \nYMCA wanted to encourage people to exercise, it needed to take advantage of patterns that already existed, and teach employees to remember visitors’ names. It’s a variation of the lesson learned by Target and radio DJs: to sell a new  habit— in this case  exercise— wrap it in something that people already know and like, such as the in-stinct to go places where it’s easy to make friends.\n“We’re cracking the code on how to keep people at the gym,” \nLazarus told me. “People want to visit places that satisfy their social \nDuhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   211 Duhi_9781400069286_2p_all_r1.j.indd   211 10/17/11   12:01 PM 10/17/11   12:01 PM\n212 ● THE POWER OF HABIT\nneeds.

However, knowing that someone might prefer a certain brand of peanut butter isn ’t enough to get them to act on that preference. To market a new  habit— be it groceries or  aerobics— you must understand how to make the novel seem familiar.\nThe last time I spoke to Andrew Pole, I mentioned that my wife \nwas seven months pregnant with our second child. Pole himself has children, and so we talked a bit about kids. My wife and I shop at Target on occasion, I said, and about a year earlier we had given the company our address, so we could start getting coupons in the mail. Recently, as my wife’s pregnancy had progressed, I’d been noticing a subtle upswing in the number of advertisements for diapers, lo-tions, and baby clothes arriving at our house.\nI was planning on using some of those coupons that very week-\nend, I told him. I was also thinking of buying a crib, and some drapes for the nursery, and maybe some Bob the Builder toys for my toddler. It was really helpful that Target was sending me exactly the right coupons for what I needed to buy.\n“Just wait till the baby comes,” Pole said. “We’ll be sending you \ncoupons for things you want before you even know you want them.”\n",
