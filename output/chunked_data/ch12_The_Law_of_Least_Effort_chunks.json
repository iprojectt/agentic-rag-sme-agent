This is because\nlocations along the same latitude generally share similar\nclimates, amounts of sunlight and rainfall, and changes in\nseason. These factors allowed farmers in Europe and Asia\nto domesticate a few crops and grow them along the entire\nstretch of land from France to China.\nTHE SHAPE OF HUMAN BEHA VIOR\nFIGURE 13:  The primary axis of Eur ope and Asia is east-west.\nThe primary axis of the Americas and A frica is north-south.

Snow is a poor\nsubstitute for soil. In order to spread crops along north-\nsouth routes, farmers would need to ﬁnd and domesticate\nnew plants whenever the climate changed.\nAs a result, agriculture spread two to three times faster\nacross Asia and Europe than it did up and down the\nAmericas. Over the span of centuries, this small diﬀerence\nhad a very big impact. Increased food production allowed\nfor more rapid population growth. W ith more people, these\ncultures were able to build stronger armies and were\nbetter equipped to develop new technologies. The changes\nstarted out small—a crop that spread slightly farther , a\npopulation that grew slightly faster—but compounded into\nsubstantial diﬀerences over time.\nThe spread of agriculture provides an example of the 3rd\nLaw of Behavior Change on a global scale. Conventional\nwisdom holds that motivation is the key to habit change.\nMaybe if you really  wanted it, you’d actually do it. But the\ntruth is, our real motivation is to be lazy and to do what is\nconvenient. And despite what the latest productivity best\nseller will tell you, this is a smart strategy , not a dumb one.\nEnergy is precious, and the brain is wired to conserve it\nwhenever possible. It is human nature to follow the Law of\nLeast Eﬀort, which states that when deciding between two\nsimilar options, people will naturally gravitate toward the\noption that requires the least amount of work. * For\nexample, expanding your farm to the east where you can\ngrow the same crops rather than heading north where the\nclimate is diﬀerent.

If your\ngoal is to do a hundred push-ups per day , that’s a lot of\nenergy! In the beginning, when you’re motivated and\nexcited, you can muster the strength to get started. But\nafter a few days, such a massive eﬀort feels exhausting.\nMeanwhile, sticking to the habit of doing one push-up per\nday requires almost no energy to get started.

And the less\nenergy a habit requires, the more likely it is to occur .\nLook at any behavior that ﬁlls up much of your life and\nyou’ll see that it can be performed with very low levels of\nmotivation. Habits like scrolling on our phones, checking\nemail, and watching television steal so much of our time\nbecause they can be performed almost without eﬀort. They\nare remarkably convenient.\nIn a sense, every habit is just an obstacle to getting what\nyou really want. Dieting is an obstacle to getting ﬁt.\nMeditation is an obstacle to feeling calm. Journaling is an\nobstacle to thinking clearly . You don’t actually want the\nhabit itself . What you really want is the outcome the habit\ndelivers. The greater the obstacle—that is, the more\ndiﬀicult the habit—the more friction there is between you\nand your desired end state. This is why it is crucial to make\nyour habits so easy that you’ll do them even when you don’t\nfeel like it. If you can make your good habits more\nconvenient, you’ll be more likely to follow through on them.\nBut what about all the moments when we seem to do the\nopposite? If we’re all so lazy , then how do you explain\npeople accomplishing hard things like raising a child or\nstarting a business or climbing Mount Everest?\nCertainly , you are capable of doing very hard things. The\nproblem is that some days you feel like doing the hard work\nand some days you feel like giving in. On the tough days,\nit’s crucial to have as many things working in your favor as\npossible so that you can overcome the challenges life\nnaturally throws your way . The less friction you face, the\neasier it is for your stronger self to emerge. The idea\nbehind make it easy is not to only do easy things. The idea\nis to make it as easy as possible in the moment to do things\nthat payoﬀ in the long run.\nHOW TO ACHIEVE MORE WITH LES S EFFOR T\nImagine you are holding a garden hose that is bent in the\nmiddle. Some water can ﬂow through, but not very much. If\nyou want to increase the rate at which water passes\nthrough the hose, you have two options. The ﬁrst option is\nto crank up the valve and force more water out. The second\noption is to simply remove the bend in the hose and let\nwater ﬂow through naturally .\nTrying to pump up your motivation to stick with a hard\nhabit is like trying to force water through a bent hose. Y ou\ncan do it, but it requires a lot of eﬀort and increases the\ntension in your life. Meanwhile, making your habits simple\nand easy is like removing the bend in the hose. R ather than\ntrying to overcome the friction in your life, you reduce it.\nOne of the most eﬀective ways to reduce the friction\nassociated with your habits is to practice environment\ndesign. In Chapter 6, we discussed environment design as a\nmethod for making cues more obvious, but you can also\noptimize your environment to make actions easier . For\nexample, when deciding where to practice a new habit, it is\nbest to choose a place that is already along the path of your\ndaily routine. Habits are easier to build when they ﬁt into\nthe ﬂow of your life. Y ou are more likely to go to the gym if\nit is on your way to work because stopping doesn’t add\nmuch friction to your lifestyle. By comparison, if the gym is\noﬀ the path of your normal commute—even by just a few\nblocks—now you’re going “out of your way” to get there.\nPerhaps even more eﬀective is reducing the friction\nwithin your home or oﬀice. T oo often, we try to start habits\nin high-friction environments. W e try to follow a strict diet\nwhile we are out to dinner with friends. W e try to write a\nbook in a chaotic household. W e try to concentrate while\nusing a smartphone ﬁlled with distractions. It doesn’t have\nto be this way . We can remove the points of friction that\nhold us back. This is precisely what electronics\nmanufacturers in Japan began to do in the 1970s.\nIn an article published in the New Y orker  titled “Better\nAll the Time,” James Suroweicki writes:\n“Japanese ﬁrms emphasized what came to be known as\n‘lean production,’ relentlessly looking to remove waste of",

    "text": "In an article published in the New Y orker  titled “Better\nAll the Time,” James Suroweicki writes:\n“Japanese ﬁrms emphasized what came to be known as\n‘lean production,’ relentlessly looking to remove waste of\nall kinds from the production process, down to redesigning\nworkspaces, so workers didn’t have to waste time twisting\nand turning to reach their tools. The result was that\nJapanese factories were more eﬀicient and Japanese\nproducts were more reliable than American ones. In 1974,\nservice calls for American-made color televisions were ﬁve\ntimes as common as for Japanese televisions. By 1979, it\ntook American workers three times as long to assemble\ntheir sets.”\nI like to refer to this strategy as addition by subtraction .*\nThe Japanese companies looked for every point of friction\nin the manufacturing process and eliminated it. As they\nsubtracted wasted eﬀort, they added customers and\nrevenue. Similarly , when we remove the points of friction\nthat sap our time and energy , we can achieve more with\nless eﬀort. (This is one reason tidying up can feel so good:\nwe are simultaneously moving forward and lightening the\ncognitive load our environment places on us.)\nIf you look at the most habit-forming products, you’ll\nnotice that one of the things these goods and services do\nbest is remove little bits of friction from your life. Meal\ndelivery services reduce the friction of shopping for\ngroceries. Dating apps reduce the friction of making social\nintroductions. Ride-sharing services reduce the friction of\ngetting across town. T ext messaging reduces the friction of\nsending a letter in the mail.\nLike a Japanese television manufacturer redesigning\ntheir workspace to reduce wasted motion, successful\ncompanies design their products to automate, eliminate, or\nsimplify as many steps as possible. They reduce the number\nof ﬁelds on each form. They pare down the number of clicks\nrequired to create an account. They deliver their products\nwith easy-to-understand directions or ask their customers\nto make fewer choices.\nWhen the ﬁrst voice-activated speakers were released—\nproducts like Google Home, Amazon Echo, and Apple\nHomeP od—I asked a friend what he liked about the product\nhe had purchased. He said it was just easier to say “Play\nsome country music” than to pull out his phone, open the\nmusic app, and pick a playlist. Of course, just a few years\nearlier , having unlimited access to music in your pocket\nwas a remarkably frictionless behavior compared to driving\nto the store and buying a CD . Business is a never-ending\nquest to deliver the same result in an easier fashion.\nSimilar strategies have been used eﬀectively by\ngovernments. When the British government wanted to\nincrease tax collection rates, they switched from sending\ncitizens to a web page where the tax form could be\ndownloaded to linking directly to the form. Reducing that\none step in the process increased the response rate from\n19.2 percent to 23.4 percent. F or a country like the United\nKingdom, those percentage points represent millions in tax\nrevenue.\nThe central idea is to create an environment where doing\nthe right thing is as easy as possible. Much of the battle of\nbuilding better habits comes down to ﬁnding ways to\nreduce the friction associated with our good habits and\nincrease the friction associated with our bad ones.\nPRIME THE ENVIRONMENT FOR FUTURE USE\nOswald Nuckols is an IT developer from Natchez,\nMississippi. He is also someone who understands the power\nof priming his environment.\nNuckols dialed in his cleaning habits by following a\nstrategy he refers to as “resetting the room.” F or instance,\nwhen he ﬁnishes watching television, he places the remote\nback on the TV stand, arranges the pillows on the couch,\nand folds the blanket. When he leaves his car , he throws\nany trash away . Whenever he takes a shower , he wipes\ndown the toilet while the shower is warming up. (As he\nnotes, the “ perfect time to clean the toilet is right before\nyou wash yourself in the shower anyway .”) The purpose of\nresetting each room is not simply to clean up after the last\naction, but to prepare for the next action.\n“When I walk into a room everything is in its right\nplace,” Nuckols wrote. “Because I do this every day in\nevery room, stuﬀ always stays in good shape. . . . P eople\nthink I work hard but I’m actually really lazy . I’m just\nproactively lazy . It gives you so much time back.”\nWhenever you organize a space for its intended purpose,\nyou are priming it to make the next action easy .",

It gives you so much time back.”\nWhenever you organize a space for its intended purpose,\nyou are priming it to make the next action easy . For\ninstance, my wife keeps a box of greeting cards that are\npresorted by occasion—birthday , sympathy , wedding,\ngraduation, and more. Whenever necessary , she grabs an\nappropriate card and sends it oﬀ . She is incredibly good at\nremembering to send cards because she has reduced the\nfriction of doing so . For years, I was the opposite. Someone\nwould have a baby and I would think, “I should send a\ncard.” But then weeks would pass and by the time I\nremembered to pick one up at the store, it was too late. The\nhabit wasn’t easy .\nThere are many ways to prime your environment so it’s\nready for immediate use. If you want to cook a healthy\nbreakfast, place the skillet on the stove, set the cooking\nspray on the counter , and lay out any plates and utensils\nyou’ll need the night before. When you wake up, making\nbreakfast will be easy .\nWant to draw more? Put your pencils, pens, notebooks,\nand drawing tools on top of your desk, within easy\nreach.\nWant to exercise? Set out your workout clothes, shoes,\ngym bag, and water bottle ahead of time.\nWant to improve your diet? Chop up a ton of fruits and\nvegetables on weekends and pack them in containers,\nso you have easy access to healthy , ready-to-eat options\nduring the week.\nThese are simple ways to make the good habit the path\nof least resistance.\nYou can also invert this principle and prime the\nenvironment to make bad behaviors diﬀicult. If you ﬁnd\nyourself watching too much television, for example, then\nunplug it after each use. Only plug it back in if you can say\nout loud the name of the show you want to watch. This\nsetup creates just enough friction to prevent mindless\nviewing.\nIf that doesn’t do it, you can take it a step further .\nUnplug the television and take the batteries out of the\nremote after each use, so it takes an extra ten seconds to\nturn it back on. And if you’re really hard-core, move the\ntelevision out of the living room and into a closet after each\nuse. Y ou can be sure you’ll only take it out when you really\nwant to watch something. The greater the friction, the less\nlikely the habit.\nWhenever possible, I leave my phone in a diﬀerent room\nuntil lunch. When it’s right next to me, I’ll check it all\nmorning for no reason at all. But when it is in another\nroom, I rarely think about it. And the friction is high\nenough that I won’t go get it without a reason. As a result, I\nget three to four hours each morning when I can work\nwithout interruption.\nIf sticking your phone in another room doesn’t seem like\nenough, tell a friend or family member to hide it from you\nfor a few hours. Ask a coworker to keep it at their desk in\nthe morning and give it back to you at lunch.\nIt is remarkable how little friction is required to prevent\nunwanted behavior . When I hide beer in the back of the\nfridge where I can’t see it, I drink less. When I delete social\nmedia apps from my phone, it can be weeks before I\ndownload them again and log in. These tricks are unlikely\nto curb a true addiction, but for many of us, a little bit of\nfriction can be the diﬀerence between sticking with a good\nhabit or sliding into a bad one. Imagine the cumulative\nimpact of making dozens of these changes and living in an\nenvironment designed to make the good behaviors easier\nand the bad behaviors harder .\nWhether we are approaching behavior change as an\nindividual, a parent, a coach, or a leader , we should ask\nourselves the same question: “How can we design a world\nwhere it’s easy to do what’s right?” Redesign your life so\nthe actions that matter most are also the actions that are\neasiest to do .\nChapter Summary\nHuman behavior follows the Law of Least Eﬀort. W e\nwill naturally gravitate toward the option that requires\nthe least amount of work.\nCreate an environment where doing the right thing is\nas easy as possible.\nReduce the friction associated with good behaviors.\nWhen friction is low , habits are easy .\nIncrease the friction associated with bad behaviors.\nWhen friction is high, habits are diﬀicult.\nPrime your environment to make future actions easier .",

    "text": "\nthink I work hard but I’m actually really lazy . I’m just\nproactively lazy . It gives you so much time back.”\nWhenever you organize a space for its intended purpose,\nyou are priming it to make the next action easy . For\ninstance, my wife keeps a box of greeting cards that are\npresorted by occasion—birthday , sympathy , wedding,\ngraduation, and more. Whenever necessary , she grabs an\nappropriate card and sends it oﬀ . She is incredibly good at\nremembering to send cards because she has reduced the\nfriction of doing so . For years, I was the opposite. Someone\nwould have a baby and I would think, “I should send a\ncard.” But then weeks would pass and by the time I\nremembered to pick one up at the store, it was too late. The\nhabit wasn’t easy .\nThere are many ways to prime your environment so it’s\nready for immediate use. If you want to cook a healthy\nbreakfast, place the skillet on the stove, set the cooking\nspray on the counter , and lay out any plates and utensils\nyou’ll need the night before. When you wake up, making\nbreakfast will be easy .\n",

Set out your workout clothes, shoes,\ngym bag, and water bottle ahead of time.\nWant to improve your diet? Chop up a ton of fruits and\nvegetables on weekends and pack them in containers,\nso you have easy access to healthy , ready-to-eat options\nduring the week.\nThese are simple ways to make the good habit the path\nof least resistance.\nYou can also invert this principle and prime the\nenvironment to make bad behaviors diﬀicult. If you ﬁnd\nyourself watching too much television, for example, then\nunplug it after each use. Only plug it back in if you can say\nout loud the name of the show you want to watch. This\nsetup creates just enough friction to prevent mindless\nviewing.\nIf that doesn’t do it, you can take it a step further .\n",
