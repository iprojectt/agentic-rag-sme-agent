THE REAL PRICE OF DELAY \nWHEN YOU'RE AT DECISION TIME and suspect you're about \nto procrastinate on an unpleasant A-l, taking a moment to \ncontemplate the consequences of delay can often get you \nback on the track. Let me tell you about a woman who hated \nto write thank-you notes. \nAnne Davis receives a birthday gift from out of town. She \ntells herself that she must take a few minutes right away and \ndrop Aunt Mary a note. A few lines will do: \"I got the \nsweater. It looks beautiful and is just my size. Thank you so \nvery much.\" \nBut Ms. Davis, being something of a perfectionist, really \ndoesn't want to settle for such an insipid note—she'd like to \nwrite something with more verve. After alL she doesn't want \nAunt Mary to think that her four years of college were a to­\ntal waste 1 She doesn't feel up to being eloquent at the mo­\nment (and, of course, she has a hundred other things to do), \nso she puts off thanking Aunt Mary for now. \nTwo weeks pass before she faces up to the fact that she \nstill has not written to Aunt Mary. By this time, she figures, \nAunt Mary is getting somewhat impatient. Well, she'll make \nup for the delay by sending off a charming two-page letter \ntelling her all about how often she wears the sweater, how \nwell it goes with several of her skirts, how comfortable it is, \nand how many compliments she has received from friends. \nShe doesn't have time to write such a long letter now . . . but \nshe tells herself she'll be sure to get around to it very soon. \nTwo more weeks go by, and now Ms. Davis is feeling very \nangry with herself. She is so ashamed, and so afraid of what \nAunt Mary must think of her. Surely she'll tell everyone in \nthe family what a lazy, ungrateful niece she has! Ms. Davis \nwill have to think up some pretty good excuses. \"Everytime I \nsit down to write you, the phone rings,\" or \"This has been \nthe busiest month of my life\" will perhaps do the trick. \n134 \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 135 \nHopefully, if she fills her letter with enough personal anec­\ndotes about her hectic life, Aunt Mary will forgive her. \nHow the Problem Escalates \nAt this point, writing the thank-you note has become very \nimportant and very unpleasant. It's not surprising that Ms. \nDavis hates writing thank-you notes! She starts worrying \nabout the letter whenever she has an odd moment. She con­\nstructs the note in her head while taking a shower and while \ntaking out the garbage, but this doesn't bring her any closer \nto getting the letter written. \nMs. Davis starts feeling terribly guilty—so guilty, in fact, \nthe thought of the letter makes her sick. In order to avoid \nthis, she now blocks out of her mind any thought of the un­\nwritten note. \nFinally one day the unwritten note comes back to haunt \nher, and Ms. Davis acknowledges to herself that it is Deci­\nsion Time. Should she: (1) write a ten-page letter bringing \nAunt Mary up-to-date on life with the Davis family for the \nlast two years, and off-handedly sneak in a thank-you for the \nsweater? (2) wait another nine months and if Aunt Mary \nsends another birthday present (hopefully she won't!) thank \nher for both presents at the same time? (3) pretend she \nnever received the sweater? (4) wait until she goes back \nhome for a visit, and then impress Aunt Mary with how she \nremembered the sweater after all these years and was waiting \nto thank her in person? (5) telephone Aunt Mary long-dis­\ntance and after a half an hour of chit-chat (at considerable \ncost) to soften her up, thank her? or (6) give up any hope of \never being able to face Aunt Mary again because how can \nshe ever explain why she couldn't find five minutes to write \na quick note the week the sweater arrived? \nWhat Is the Price of Delay? \nMs. Davis's delay in thanking Aunt Mary cost her many \nminutes of anguish. She would have suffered less had she \nslowed down and made a deliberate effort to recall the conse­\nquences of her past delays: Her Aunt had felt slighted before \n136 ALAN LAKEIN \nand her own mother had written an admonishing letter about \nit.

LEARN TO STRESS THE BENEFITS \nTM NOW GOING to describe a technicrae called \"Stress the \nBenefits\" to help you muster enthusiasm at Decision Time for \nany unappetizing A-l. \nConsider Mr. O'Henry, who had an idea that he thought \nwould save his organization several thousand dollars a year. \nNormally he would have submitted his idea immediately to \nhis company's suggestion system. But this time he delayed \nsubmitting his proposal, because he knew that, if adopted, it \nmight mean cutting back on the work assigned to one of his \nco-workers. \nThe improvement Mr. O'Henry envisioned was tricky. \nThere was a certain amount of risk involved.

You can say, \"Well, now, if I do this I'm going \nto keep my job, and I'm going to get promoted.\" Then you \ncan build up the reward in your mind. If you have a good set \nof Lifetime Goals you can probably think of many more con­\nnections between doing this A-l and achieving some Lifetime \nGoals. Again, you're Stressing the Benefits. \nAnother way of keeping the value of the task in front of \nyou is to give yourself a little taste in advance of what will \nhappen if you do keep working on the A-l. Remember that \nvacation I have promised myself for when I finish my book? \nWell, long before I actually finish TU go down to our travel \nagent and make the airline, hotel, and car-rental reservations. \nThen I'll go back and keep on writing. I get further along on \nmy A-l by Stressing the Benefits. \nAnother way to get yourself to do unpleasant A-l's is to \nturn the whole task into a game. Let's say painting your liv­\ning room took you and your wife ten hours four years ago. \nHave you improved with age? See if you can shave some \ntime off that ten hours.

This \"something else,\" whatever its intrinsic value \n(which may be very high), is in part appealing because it is \nan Escape from doing or thinking about the A-l. \nEveryone has favorite Escapes.

Therefore, it is easy to tell yourself \nyou're really making good use of your time, even though you \nare not doing the A-l. And perhaps you are. But you're not \nmaking the best use of your time. \nThe best use of your time—as you've already decided—is \nto do the A-l. Anything else is a comparative waste of time. \nConsider one of my clients, a research scientist. He kept \nprocrastinating on a difficult research study that had a very \nhigh priority. Despite his efforts to get involved and to con­\nvince himself how important it was, he kept stalling. At my \nsuggestion, he began to take a careful look at each Decision \nTime when he chose to avoid the A-l and turned to some­\nthing else. \nAt first, he felt like a helpless observer. It seemed as if the \nprocrastination process was operating in spite of anything he \ncould do. Rather than be discouraged at this point, he con­\nsoled himself with the knowledge that he was trying to under­\nstand the dynamics of the process, which is the first step \ntoward controlling it. \nAfter several days of closely watching his actions at Deci-\n146 ALAN LAKEIN \nsion Time, he found certain patterns emerging. The thought \nof doing the A-l was always followed immediately by feel­\nings of inadequacy and tension. Most of the time he then \nquickly turned to making improvements on an old and famil­\niar research problem.

He would talk to someone about some \naspect of this other study, or rethink and rewrite portions \nthat needed polishing. He felt completely on top of the situa­\ntion. He was not doing the A-l, but he was doing something \nimportant and productive. \nIn the back of his mind, however, was the nagging thought \nthat he was rationalizing. He was not perfecting the old re­\nport because it was essential (it was worth doing, but not \nnow). He was doing it because it provided an easy Escape \nfrom the A-l. \nOn my recommendation, every time he found himself \nworking on the old project he repeated silently over and over \nto himself, *Tm wasting my time.\" During the next week or \nso he admitted to himself dozens of times \"I'm wasting my \ntime.\" \nAt first, saying this didn't stop him from turning to an Es­\ncape. Then the words began to make a difference. He ac­\nknowledged that he really was wasting his time. The benefits \nhe before associated with doing the Escape tasks had now \nlost much of their appeal. \nAs he realized more and more that he was wasting his \nown time, the tide began to change. Instead of letting the \nprocrastination process run him, he told himself that he \ndidn't have to waste his time. lust as he had chosen to do Es­\ncapes, he could choose to do the A-l. It really was a black \nand white choice—Escape vs. the A-l.

To make sure \nthat you really won't need to go, do something concrete \nabout those meal-planning, stocking and freezing ideas you've \nbeen contemplating for years. If you forget something or run \nout, try to make do. \nThe Great Escape for nearly everybody is television. Lib­\nerate yourself! Give your set away and then stalk your A-ll \nOne final suggestion along these lines: You might want to \ngive your secretary a list of your favorite Escapes. lust the \nfact that you know she has the list may prevent you from \nutilizing these dodges except in the most severe cases. \nYon Can Procrastinate Positively \nIt's just possible that you've tried all the suggestions Tve \nmade about how to stop procrastinating—without success. \nO.K. If you have to procrastinate, I'm going to show you \nhow to do it positively. \nSit in a chair and do nothing. That's right—nothing. Don't \nread a book, don't shuffle papers, don't tackle your knitting, \ndon't watch TV—just sit completely still. \nIf you sit doing nothing for fifteen or twenty minutes \n(don't cheat—you must do absolutely nothing), you should \nbecome very uneasy. That A-l is staring you right in the \nface. And you're doing nothing. Precious minutes that you \ncan use accomplishing a lifetime goal are slipping by.

The Royal Cana­\ndian Air Force exercises build gradually from day to day so \nthat the exerciser is hardly aware of the increased effort re­\nquired to do the next day's exercise; yet the cumulative effect \nover several months is significant. \nTherefore, I suggest that if you want to increase your will­\npower you begin by practicing in easy situations before ap­\nplying the willpower you're building to do more and more \ndifficult tasks. \nNormally, the only time when people consciously test their \nwillpower is when they need it. But if you apply it only when \nthe task is difficult and you need all the help you can get, it \nwill not be surprising if you fail fairly often. \nThe will is like a wild horse. If you want to train a wild \nhorse to do productive work, you obviously can't tame it by \nrunning away. You have to keep in contact with the horse. \nThere's really only one way to succeed: To get on that horse \nand stay on. Try to ride it. You may have to pick yourself off \nthe ground several times, but stick with it. The idea is to stay \nwith it even if the horse is going in the wrong direction. \nSuppose the horse is heading for its favorite spot far out in \nthe pasture. It's on a course that will take it between two \ntrees. You're not able to get it to do an about-face, but you \nmay be able to alter its course. If you continue this process \npatiently, you'll eventually be able to get the horse to go \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 151 \nHow to Wean Yourself Away from TV \nAt this point you've changed nothing about your actions. \nYou're still doing something contrary to what you want to \ndo, and you can't stop yourself. Claim credit for the decision. \nGo ahead, don't be afraid. Recognize that your will was in­\nvolved when you stayed in bed late or turned from your let­\nters to the TV. \nThe first step is to train yourself to become less compulsive \nabout \"reflex\" actions like watching television.

When the next commercial comes \nalong, you just sit there and congratulate yourself on not get­\nting up again. \nThe next day you begin again with the same plan, and this \ntime you get up six times before pooping out. Again you re­\nfuse to turn the sound down after that However, during a \nparticularly obnoxious commercial about midnight you find \nyourself starting to get up again. Now you cannot lose! If \nyou get up and turn it off, congratulate yourself on your will­\npower in going back to your original plan. If you do not turn \nit off, congratulate yourself on your willpower in resisting the \ndesire to turn it off and sticking to your revised decision not \nto get up again. \nInterpret whatever you do as exactly what you wanted to \ndo. This shows you're truly in control of your actions. \nThe next night, try a different strategy. This time turn off \nevery alternate bathroom products commercial. If you miss \none, don't be the least concerned. Simply tell yourself, \"I re­\nserve the right to change my mind and I've decided that ITl \nmake an exception in this case.\" Your making an exception \nalso helps to demonstrate that you're not an inflexible ma­\nchine but a thinking, feeling, spontaneous person. Be proud \nof it! Interpret all your actions as positive, as exactly what \nyou want to do. \nAfter a couple of weeks, turn the sound up and down on \nother kinds of commercials (margarine, coffee, automobile). \nYou're beginning to become more aware of how many differ­\nent kinds of commercials there are and how annoying they \ncan be. You're also starting to suspect that there must be a \nlot of things around that are more fun than watching TV \ncommercials. You can confirm this if you experiment by lis­\ntening carefully to every word of every commercial the next \nnight without exception. Notice how much willpower you've \nbuilt up to be able to listen closely to something that you are \nnow really beginning to dislike. \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 153 \nOne of my clients was particularly ingenious in developing \nhis willpower while watching TV. In his first experiments he \ndeliberately waited a few seconds until after the commercial \nwas over and he did not turn the sound back up until after \nthe program had actually resumed. He gradually extended \nthis soundless time from two seconds to five and then to fif­\nteen. Next he experimented with turning the whole set off \nwhen a bathroom product commercial came on, and read a \nmagazine while it was off. Sometimes he decided to finish \nreading the page before returning to a program that was not \none of his favorites.

What's the use of complaining to yourself ev-\nerytime the rake misses a leaf and you have to go back \nagain? \nTry to spend a couple of extra minutes on an unpleasant A \nbefore calling it a day. Cut back a couple of minutes on the \nC, even if it's your pet project. Don't turn to the TV for es­\ncape from an unpleasant A. Remember: a little more will \ncan eventually build up to a lot more willpower. \n23. DO YOUR BEST AND \nCONSIDER IT A SUCCESS \nARE YOU WILLING TO SPEND every evening this week to \nmake a start on attaining a lifetime goal even though success \nis not assured? If you don't try, you guarantee failure. If you \ndo try you have the chance to succeed, but failure is still a \npossibility. What to do? \nMost people spend their lives minimizing losses rather than \nmaximizing gains. For example, take reading the Sunday pa­\nper. Do you read every page because you're afraid you will \nmiss something? The more you move away from the front \npage, and those sections that you know interest you, the less \nnews you will find. The result: You waste time reading much \nthat doesn't really interest you, when you could have played \nwith the kids, read a book or worked in your darkroom. \nSome people use up valuable time by endlessly weighing \npros and cons for fear of taking a wrong step. Making \"mis­\ntakes\" can be a great time-saver. You find out what works by \ntrying. You get rid of unrealistic goals by having tried and \nfailed to accomplish them. For the rest of your life you \nmight have continued to cherish the dream of writing poetry. \nBut now that you've spent several evenings working steadily \nat it, you can assure yourself that given your personality, po­\netry is impossible—at least for the present. Forget it and find \na more realistic goal instead. What may seem defeating at \nfirst is really constructive: You're building bridges that will \neventually take you closer to where you really want to be. \nStudies have shown that people who hoped (and strived) \nfor success were happier and accomplished more than those \nwho feared (and expected) failure. If you're willing to accept \nthe initial failures on your way to success, you'll find the en­\nergy you need to keep digging until you hit pay dirt. Don't be \ndiscouraged by \"mistakes.\" Trial and error is part of being \nhuman. Think that each \"mistake\" is bringing you a little \ncloser to eventual success. \n155 \n156 ALAN LAKEIN \nI like to call this process **trial and success.\" I recall a par­\nticularly difficult period in my life when things just weren't \ngoing well.

The director asked the man whether he \nwished to repeat the movement. The dancer replied, \"No. It's \nnot necessary. Now I know what to do.\" The failure made \nthe rehearsal a success. The dancer now knew what he had to \ndo. It was trial and success. \nIn scientific research multiple \"failures\" commonly lead to \nsuccess. The combined unsuccessful experiments of Marie \nCurie, Alexander Fleming, and Louis Pasteur run into the \nthousands. It would have been easy for any one of them to \ngive up after the first hundred failures or so, but today we \nmight have no radium, no penicillin, and no pasteurized milk. \nOr take the following extraordinary personal history of \nfailure: \nLost job, 1832; defeated for legislature, 1832; failed in \nbusiness, 1833; elected to legislature, 1834; sweetheart died, \n1835; had nervous breakdown, 1836; defeated for Speaker, \n1838; defeated for nomination for Congress, 1843; elected to \nCongress, 1846; lost renomination, 1848; rejected for land \nHOW TO GET CONTROL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR LIFE 157 \nofficer, 1849; defeated for Senate, 1854; defeated for nomi­\nnation for Vice-President, 1856; again defeated for Senate, \n1858; but in 1860 Abraham Lincoln was elected President of \nthe United States. \nLife can only be led on a \"best efforts\" basis. To look back \nand say \"I could have done better\" is not realistic. O.K., so \nyou might have wished to do better. And you can imagine \nhaving done better. But the fact that you didn't means that, \nunder the circumstances, you couldn't. \nSo don't let failure stop you from trying. Don't waste time \nworrying about what went \"wrong.\" You can learn something \nfrom every experience. Remember: You're older and wiser \nthan the last time you dealt with a similar situation, even if it \nwas only fifteen minutes ago. \nThe habits of a lifetime cannot be changed in a few days. \nIt takes time—sometimes a year or two. There is no \"Open \nSesame\" to getting control of your time and your life. But \nyou can make much progress toward realizing your everyday \nand life goals in even a short time. I encourage you to begin \nas soon as you finish this page. I've seen remarkable results \nwhen people apply the techniques IVe recommended. \nYou too can get more enjoyment from every minute, be \nmore successful in your career and personal life, and accom­\nplish more with less effort. Today can mark a real turning \npoint for you. You can get more time out of your life. \nSo what is the best use of your time right now? \nAPPENDIX \nHow I Save Time \n1. I count all my time as \"On-Time\" and try to get satis­\nfaction (not necessarily accomplishment) out of every \nminute. \n2. I try to enjoy whatever I am doing. \n3. I'm a perennial optimist. \n4. I build on successes. \n5. I don't waste time regretting my failures. \n6. I don't waste my time feeling guilty about what I dont \ndo. \n7. I remind myself: \"There is always enough time for the \nimportant things.\" If it's important 111 make the time to \ndoit \n8. I try to find a new technique each day that I can use to \nhelp gain time. \n9. I get up at 5 a.m. during the week (and go to bed \nearly). \n10.

I always plan first thing in the morning and set priorities \nfor the day. \n24. I keep a list of specific items to be done each day, ar­\nrange them in priority order, and then do my best to get \nthe important ones done as soon as possible. \n25.

I do much of my thinking on paper. \n43. I work alone creatively in the morning and use the af­\nternoons for meetings, if necessary. \n44. I set deadlines for myself and others. \n45. I try to listen actively in every discussion. \n46. I try not to waste other people's time (unless it's some­\nthing that really matters to me). \n47. I delegate everything I possibly can to others. \n48. I make use of specialists to help me with special prob­\nlems. \n49. I have someone screen my mail and phone calk and \nhandle all routine matters. \n50. I generate as little paperwork as possible and throw \naway anything I possibly can. \n51.
