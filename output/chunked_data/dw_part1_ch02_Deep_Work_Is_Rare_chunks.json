He \nthen combined these numbers with the \nemployees’  average typing speed, \nreading speed, and salary. The result: He \ndiscovered that Atlantic Media was \nspending well over a million dollars a \nyear to pay people to process e-mails, \nwith every message sent or received \ntapping the company for around ninety- \nfive cents of labor costs. “A ‘free and \nfrictionless’  method of communication,” \nCochran summarized, “had soft costs\n\nequ",

But \nthe real importance of this story is the \nexperiment itself, and in particular, its \ncomplexity. It turns out to be really \ndifficult to answer a simple question \nsuch as: What’s the impact of our current \ne-mail habits on the bottom line? \nCochran had to conduct a company-wide \nsurvey and gather statistics from the IT \ninfrastructure. He also had to pull \ntogether salary data and information on \ntyping and reading speed, and run the \nwhole thing through a statistical model\n\nto spit out his final result.

She \nwanted to test a simple question: Does it\n\nreally help your work to be constantly \nconnected? To do so, she did something \nextreme: She forced each member of the \nteam to take one day out of the \nworkweek completely off—no \nconnectivity to anyone inside or outside \nthe company.\n“At first, the team resisted the \nexperiment,” she recalled about one of \nthe trials. “The partner in charge, who \nhad been very supportive of the basic \nidea, was suddenly nervous about having \nto tell her client that each member of her \nteam would be off one day a week.” The \nconsultants were equally nervous and \nworried that they were “putting their \ncareers in jeopardy.” But the team didn’t\n\nlose their clients and its members did \nnot lose their jobs.

Here’s the social critic Matthew \nCrawford’s description of this \nuncertainty: “Managers themselves\ninhabit a bewildering psychic landscape, \nand are made anxious by the vague \nimperatives they must answer to.”\n\nThough Crawford was speaking \nspecifically to the plight of the \nknowledge work middle manager, the \n“bewildering psychic landscape” he \nreferences applies to many positions in \nthis sector. As Crawford describes in his \n2009 ode to the trades, Shop Class as  \nSoulcraft , he quit his job as a \nWashington, D.C., think tank director to \nopen a motorcycle repair shop exactly to \nescape this bewilderment. The feeling of \ntaking a broken machine, struggling with \nit, then eventually enjoying a tangible \nindication that he had succeeded (the \nbike driving out of the shop under its \nown power) provides a concrete sense \nof accomplishment he struggled to\n\nreplicate when his day revolved vaguely \naround reports and communications \nstrategies.\nA similar reality creates problems \nfor many knowledge workers. They want \nto prove that they’re productive \nmembers of the team and are earning \ntheir keep, but they’re not entirely clear \nwhat this goal constitutes. They have no \nrising h-index or rack of repaired \nmotorcycles to point to as evidence of \ntheir worth. To overcome this gap, many \nseem to be turning back to the last time \nwhen productivity was more universally \nobservable: the industrial age.\nTo understand this claim, recall that \nwith the rise of assembly lines came the\n\nrise of the Efficiency Movement, \nidentified with its founder, Frederic \nTaylor, who would famously stand with \na stopwatch monitoring the efficiency of \nworker movements— looking for ways to \nincrease the speed at which they \naccomplished their tasks. In Taylor’s \nera, productivity was unambiguous: \nwidgets created per unit of time. It \nseems that in today’s business \nlandscape, many knowledge workers, \nbereft of other ideas, are turning toward \nthis old definition of productivity in \ntrying to solidify their value in the \notherwise bewildering landscape of \ntheir professional lives.

But this deep strategy \nturned out to produce a massive amount \nof value.\nWe could, of course, eliminate this\n\nanachronistic commitment to busyness if \nwe could easily demonstrate its negative \nimpact on the bottom line, but the metric \nblack hole enters the scene at this point \nand prevents such clarity. This potent \nmixture of job ambiguity and lack of \nmetrics to measure the effectiveness of \ndifferent strategies allows behavior that \ncan seem ridiculous when viewed \nobjectively to thrive in the increasingly \nbewildering psychic landscape of our \ndaily work.\nAs we’ll see next, however, even \nthose who have a clear understanding of \nwhat it means to succeed in their \nknowledge work job can still be lured \naway from depth. All it takes is an\n\nideology seductive enough to convince \nyou to discard common sense.\nThe Cult of the Internet\nConsider Alissa Rubin. She’s the New \nYork Times'  bureau chief in Paris. \nBefore that she was the bureau chief in \nKabul, Afghanistan, where she reported \nfrom the front lines on the postwar \nreconstruction. Around the time I was \nwriting this chapter, she was publishing \na series of hard-hitting articles that \nlooked at the French government’s \ncomplicity in the Rwandan genocide. \nRubin, in other words, is a serious\n\njournalist who is good at her craft. She \nalso, at what I can only assume is the \npersistent urging of her employer, \ntweets.\nRubin’s Twitter profile reveals a \nsteady and somewhat desultory string of \nmissives, one every two to four days, as \nif Rubin receives a regular notice from \nthe Times ’  social media desk (a real \nthing) reminding her to appease her \nfollowers. With few exceptions, the \ntweets simply mention an article she \nrecently read and liked.\nRubin is a reporter, not a media \npersonality. Her value to her paper is \nher ability to cultivate important \nsources, pull together facts, and write\n\narticles that make a splash. It’s the \nAlissa Rubins of the world who provide \nthe Times  with its reputation, and it’s \nthis reputation that provides the \nfoundation for the paper’s commercial \nsuccess in an age of ubiquitous and \naddictive click-bait. So why is Alissa \nRubin urged to regularly interrupt this \nnecessarily deep work to provide, for \nfree, shallow content to a service run by \nan unrelated media company based out \nof Silicon Valley? And perhaps even \nmore important, why does this behavior \nseem so normal to most people? If we \ncan answer these questions, we’ll better \nunderstand the final trend I want to \ndiscuss relevant to the question of why\n\ndeep work has become so paradoxically \nrare.\nA foundation for our answer can be \nfound in a warning provided by the late \ncommunication theorist and New York \nUniversity professor Neil Postman. \nWriting in the early 1990s, as the \npersonal computer revolution first \naccelerated, Postman argued that our \nsociety was sliding into a troubling \nrelationship with technology. We were, \nhe noted, no longer discussing the trade­\noffs surrounding new technologies, \nbalancing the new efficiencies against \nthe new problems introduced. If it’s \nhigh-tech, we began to instead assume, \nthen it’s good. Case closed.\n\nHe called such a culture a \ntechnopoly,  and he didn’t mince words \nin warning against it. “Technopoly \neliminates alternatives to itself in \nprecisely the way Aldous Huxley \noutlined in Brave New World”  he \nargued in his 1993 book on the topic. “It \ndoes not make them illegal. It does not \nmake them immoral. It does not even \nmake them unpopular. It makes them \ninvisible and therefore irrelevant.” \nPostman died in 2003, but if he were \nalive today he would likely express \namazement about how quickly his fears \nfrom the 1990s came to fruition—a slide \ndriven by the unforeseen and sudden rise \nof the Internet. Fortunately, Postman has\n\nan intellectual heir to continue this \nargument in the Internet Age: the\nhypercitational social critic Evgeny \nMorozov. In his 2013 book, To Save  \nEverything, Click Here , Morozov \nattempts to pull back the curtains on our \ntechnopolic obsession with “the \nInternet” (a term he purposefully places \nin scare quotes to emphasize its role as \nan ideology), saying: “It’s this\npropensity to view ‘the Internet’  as a \nsource",

To make your company \nmore like “the Internet” is to be with the \ntimes, and to ignore these trends is to be \nthe proverbial buggy-whip maker in an \nautomotive age. We no longer see \nInternet tools as products released by \nfor-profit companies, funded by \ninvestors hoping to make a return, and \nrun by twentysomethings who are often \nmaking things up as they go along. We’re \ninstead quick to idolize these digital \ndoodads as a signifier of progress and a \nharbinger of a (dare I say, brave) new \nworld.\nThis Internet-centrism (to steal\n\nanother Morozov term) is what \ntechnopoly looks like today. It’s \nimportant that we recognize this reality \nbecause it explains the question that \nopened this section. The New York Times  \nmaintains a social media desk and \npressures its writers, like Alissa Rubin, \ntoward distracting behavior, because in \nan Internet-centric technopoly such \nbehavior is not up for discussion. The \nalternative, to not embrace all things \nInternet, is, as Postman would say, \n“invisible and therefore irrelevant.”\nThis invisibility explains the uproar, \nmentioned earlier, that arose when \nJonathan Franzen dared suggest that \nnovelists shouldn’t tweet. It riled people\n\nnot because they’re well versed in book \nmarketing and disagreed with Franzen’s \nconclusion, but because it surprised \nthem that anyone serious would suggest \nthe irrelevance of social media. In an \nInternet-centric technopoly such a \nstatement is the equivalent of a flag \nburning—desecration, not debate.\nPerhaps the near universal reach of \nthis mind-set is best captured in an \nexperience I had recently on my \ncommute to the Georgetown campus \nwhere I work. Waiting for the light to \nchange so I could cross Connecticut \nAvenue, I idled behind a truck from a \nrefrigerated supply chain logistics \ncompany. Refrigerated shipping is a\n\ncomplex, competitive business that \nrequires equal skill managing trade \nunions and route scheduling. It’s the \nultimate old-school industry and in many \nways is the opposite of the lean \nconsumer-facing tech start-ups that \ncurrently receive so much attention. \nWhat struck me as I waited in traffic \nbehind this truck, however, was not the \ncomplexity or scale of this company, but \ninstead a graphic that had been \ncommissioned and then affixed,\nprobably at significant expense, on the \nback of this entire fleet of trucks— a \ngraphic that read: “like us on\nFacebook.”\nDeep work is at a severe\n\ndisadvantage in a technopoly because it \nbuilds on values like quality, \ncraftsmanship, and mastery that are \ndecidedly old-fashioned and \nnontechnological. Even worse, to \nsupport deep work often requires the \nrejection of much of what is new and \nhigh-tech.

    "text": " for your job, \nthe visible busyness that surrounds \nshallow work becomes self-preserving, \nand that our culture has developed a \nbelief that if a behavior relates to “the \nInternet,” then it’s good—regardless of \nits impact on our ability to produce \nvaluable things. All of these trends are \nenabled by the difficulty of directly \nmeasuring the value of depth or the cost \nof ignoring it.\nIf you believe in the value of depth, \nthis reality spells bad news for \nbusinesses in general, as it’s leading\n\nthem to miss out on potentially massive \nincreases in their value production. But \nfor you, as an individual, good news \nlurks. The myopia of your peers and \nemployers uncovers a great personal \nadvantage. Assuming the trends outlined \nhere continue, depth will become \nincreasingly rare and therefore \nincreasingly valuable. Having just \nestablished that there’s nothing \nfundamentally flawed about deep work \nand nothing fundamentally necessary \nabout the distracting behaviors that \ndisplace it, you can therefore continue \nwith confidence with the ultimate goal of \nthis book: to systematically develop \nyour personal ability to go deep—and by\n\ndoing so,",
