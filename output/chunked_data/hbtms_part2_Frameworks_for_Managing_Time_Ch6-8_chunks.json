Avoid allowing others to waste your time4. If you don’t have to drive to work, use that time to study or plan. If you do\n    drive to work listen to a motivational tape on the way to work instead of\n    that mindless dj talk.\n5. Organize your work; do it systematically.\n6. Make creative use of lunchtime.7. Delegate authority if, possible.\n8. Spend less time on unimportant phone calls.\n9. Think first, and then do the task.10. Do what you dream about doing, instead of just dreaming about it.\n11. Work hardest when you’re the most mentally alert\n12. Eliminate activities that make the smallest contributions to your life.13. Always do the toughest jobs first.\n14. Before each major act ask, “Is this really necessary?”\n15. Choose interesting and constructive literature for spare time reading.16. Learn how to sleep. Sleep soundly, then work refreshed.\nSoft Skills for Public Managers\n1217. Skip desserts.\n18. Stop smoking.\n19. Write notes or letters while waiting for others.20. Always carry an envelope with paper in it and a few stamps.\n21. Combine tasks that are done in the same area.\n22. Be prompt for all appointments.23.

The ‘Five TimeZone Concept’ advocated by Lewis, Justus and Storz, Moni Laui (Switch on Your Mind:\nAccelerative Learning Strategies at Work.) enables managers to bring about that balance.\nThe five links in the ‘Five Time Zone’ approach are - vision, plans, personal organisationsystems, commitment and energy.\n•Developing Zone 1 - Vision and Goals:  Managers must search for visions, not\ntasks. These visions are guided by their personal standards and values, and the\ndirection they want to take. Once their visions are crystallized, they need to dosome thinking to create goals from their visions and action steps from their goals.\nMy vision and goals . . .\n• What is most important to me?\n•  What would I like to do if there were no limitations?•  What things in my life would I like to be different?\n•  My visions for myself are . . .\n•Developing Zone 2 - Plans:  Having established goals, managers now can move\ninto zone two - plans. A plan is needed to turn visions and goals into action. Writingthings down and using some form of planning ‘tool’ are keys to successful planning.\nOnce they have drawn up the plan, they need to review it. They should plan for high-\npayoff and low-payoff activities for high and low priorities.\n•Developing Zone 3 – Personal Organization Systems (POS):  Zone three\nencompasses a manager’s personal organisation system. Organising the desk,follow-up, paperwork, physical environment are all part of personal organization\nsystem.

Procrastination can be overcome by identifying why one is\nprocrastinating, breaking the mental blocks and visualizing the successful completion\nof a task while in a relaxed state.

These include deadline-driven tasks\nand important daily chores. The results of operating in this Quadrant are stress, burnout andcrisis management\nNot\nImportantImportantUrgent Not Urgent\nQuadrant  I Quadrant  II\nQuadrant  III Quadrant  IVQ2 : Calm and in controlQ1 : Sruggling to stay ahead\nNot\nImportantImportantUrgent Not Urgent\nQuadrant  I Quadrant  II\nQuadrant  III Quadrant  IV\n\nHandbook on Time Management Skills\n17The activities in Quadrant 2 are important but not urgent. These activities are characterized\nas preparation, planning, crisis prevention, and deadline-avoiding tasks. Operating in this\nQuadrant will mean a manager having a proper perspective, vision, balance, discipline,control and few crises.\nThe activities in Quadrant 3 are not important but urgently press upon us and interrupt our more\nimportant activities. These include responding to drop-in visitors, phone calls, meetings, andmail that do not increase productivity and effectiveness. Operating in this Quadrant will meanshort-term focus, crisis management, worthlessness of goals and plans, feeling of victimiza-\ntion and broken relationships.Q3 : Busy going nowhere\nNot\nImportantImportantUrgent Not Urgent\nQuadrant  I Quadrant  II\nQuadrant  III Quadrant  IV\nSoft Skills for Public Managers\n18The activities in Quadrant 4 are neither important nor urgent. Busywork, time wasters, junk\nmail, and some phone calls are the type of activities that are a part of this quadrant.\nOperating in this Quadrant will mean total irresponsibility and over-dependence on others\nin addition to outcomes in Quadrant 3.\nFrom a study of the Time Management Matrix, the following observations can be made:\n1. Activities in Quadrant I and Quadrant II may be equally important. Some activities in\nQuadrant II may even be more important than activities in Quadrant I, but not\nnecessarily more urgent.\n2. Activities in Quadrant I assume critical importance and top priority.\n3. Spending most of the time on Activities in Quadrant I results in stress and burnout.\n4. Focusing on activities in Quadrant II can reduce the activities in Quadrant I, in the long\nrun.\n5. Focusing on activities in Quadrant II will mean avoiding all unimportant activities in\nQuadrant III and IV.Q4 : Aspiring to mediocrity\nNot\nImportantImportantUrgent Not Urgent\nQuadrant  I Quadrant  II\nQuadrant  III Quadrant  IV",
