The author suggests that instead of relying on individual productivity hacks, leaders must practice 'cognitive design' by creating work environments that support 'whole-brain' thinking. This involves leveraging other neural systems like the Default Mode Network (DMN) and Salience Network. The article provides actionable strategies, including auditing the type of thinking, making recovery a visible cultural norm, designing team rhythms for different cognitive modes, and simplifying systems to reduce cognitive clutter."
